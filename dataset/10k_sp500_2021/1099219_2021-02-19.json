    "text": "Index to Business\n4\nBusiness Overview & Strategy\nAs used in this Form 10-K, “MetLife,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999, its subsidiaries and affiliates.\nMetLife is one of the world’s leading financial services companies, providing insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. We hold leading market positions in the United States, Japan, Latin America, Asia, Europe and the Middle East.\nWe are also one of the largest institutional investors in the United States with a general account portfolio invested primarily in fixed income securities (corporate, structured products, municipals, and government and agency) and mortgage loans, as well as real estate, real estate joint ventures, other limited partnerships and equity securities.\nOur well-recognized brand, globally diversified and market-leading businesses, competitive and innovative product offerings and financial strength and expertise should help drive future growth and enhance shareholder value. Over the course of the next several years, we will continue to execute on our Next Horizon strategy, creating value focusing on the following three pillars:\nMetLife is organized into five segments: U.S.; Asia; Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and MetLife Holdings. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate & Other. See “— Segments and Corporate & Other” and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company’s segments and Corporate & Other.\n5\nIn the United States, we provide a variety of insurance and financial services products, including life, dental, disability, vision, accident & health, capital market investment, property and casualty, guaranteed interest, stable value and annuities.\nOutside the United States, we provide life, medical, dental, credit and other accident & health insurance, as well as annuities, endowment and retirement & savings products. We believe these businesses will generally continue to grow more quickly than our United States businesses.\n6\nSegments and Corporate & Other\nU.S.\nOur businesses in the U.S. segment offer a broad range of protection products and services aimed at serving the financial needs of our customers throughout their lives. These products are sold to corporations and their respective employees, other institutions and their respective members, as well as individuals. Our U.S. segment is organized into three businesses: Group Benefits, Retirement and Income Solutions (“RIS”) and Property & Casualty.\nGroup Benefits\nWe have built a leading position in the United States group insurance market through long-standing relationships with many of the largest corporate employers in the United States.\nOur Group Benefits business offers life insurance, dental, group short- and long-term disability (“LTD”), individual disability, accidental death and dismemberment (“AD&D”) insurance, vision, and accident & health insurance, as well as prepaid legal plans. We also sell administrative services-only (“ASO”) arrangements to some employers. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company's acquisition of Versant Health, Inc. (“Versant Health”), a managed vision care company.\nWe distribute Group Benefits products and services through a sales force primarily comprised of MetLife employees that is segmented by the size of the target customer. Account executives sell either directly to corporate and other group customers or through an intermediary, such as a broker or consultant. Employers have been emphasizing voluntary products and, as a result, we have increased our focus on communicating and marketing to employees in order to further foster sales of those products.\nWe have entered into several operating joint ventures and other arrangements with third parties to expand opportunities to market and distribute Group Benefits products and services. We also sell our Group Benefits products and services through sponsoring associations and affinity groups and provide life, dental, accident & health, and vision coverage to certain employees of the U.S. Government. We have longstanding relationships with these employees and continue to cultivate and expand them through additional product offerings.\nGroup Benefits business quarterly claims experience may vary, as seasonal illnesses effect mortality and morbidity and due to utilization rate fluctuation in our non-medical health businesses. Annual benefit renewal implementation, enrollment, and marketing costs normally elevate Group Benefits business’ expenses in the fourth quarter.\n7\nRetirement and Income Solutions\nOur RIS business provides funding and financing solutions that help institutional customers mitigate and manage liabilities primarily associated with their employee benefit programs using a spectrum of life and annuity-based insurance and investment products.\nWe distribute RIS products and services through dedicated sales teams and relationship managers primarily comprised of MetLife employees. We may sell products directly to benefit plan sponsors and advisors or through brokers, consultants or other intermediaries. In addition, these sales professionals work with individual, group and global distribution areas to better reach and service customers, brokers, consultants and other intermediaries.\n8\nProperty & Casualty\nOur Property & Casualty business offers personal lines of property and casualty insurance, including private passenger automobile, homeowners’ and personal excess liability insurance. In December 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its wholly-owned subsidiary, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively “MetLife P&C”) to Farmers Group, Inc. Also, the Company and the Farmers Exchanges have established a 10-year strategic partnership through which the Farmers Insurance Group will offer its personal line products on MetLife’s U.S. Group Benefits platform which will commence when the transaction closes. For further information on the pending disposition, reported as held-for-sale, see Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n9\nWe market and sell Property & Casualty products through independent agents, property and casualty specialists and brokers.\nWe are a leading provider of personal lines property and casualty insurance products offered to employees at their employer’s worksite. Marketing representatives market personal lines property and casualty insurance products to employers through a variety of means, including broker referrals and cross-selling to group customers. Once permitted by the employer, MetLife commences marketing efforts to employees, enabling them to purchase coverage and to request payroll deduction over the telephone.\nAsia\nOur Asia segment offers a broad range of products to both individuals and corporations, as well as to other institutions, and their respective employees.\nWe operate in nine jurisdictions throughout Asia, with our largest operation in Japan. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company's sale of its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, MetLife Limited and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company of Hong Kong Limited (collectively, “MetLife Hong Kong”).\nOur Asia operations are geographically diverse encompassing both developed and emerging markets. We market our products and services through a range of proprietary and third-party distribution channels.\nIn Japan, our digitally-enabled face-to-face channels, along with bancassurance and direct marketing, continue to be critical to our overall distribution strategy. Our competitive advantage in bancassurance is based on robust distribution relationships with Japan’s very large banks, trust banks and various regional banks. Outside of Japan, our distribution strategies vary by market and leverage a combination of career and independent agencies, bancassurance and direct marketing (including inbound and outbound telemarketing, online lead generation and sales). In select markets, we also use independent brokers and our employee sales force to sell group products.\n10\nLatin America\nOur Latin America segment offers a broad range of products to both individuals and corporations and other institutions (including local, state and federal governments) and their respective employees. We offer government employees life, medical insurance, as well as retirement and savings, and other products, and periodically submit bids to do so.\nOur largest operations are in Mexico and Chile. We market our products and services through a multi-channel distribution strategy which varies by geographic region and stage of market development.\nWe have an exclusive and captive agency distribution network which sells a variety of individual life, accident & health, and pension products. Our direct marketing channel includes sponsors and telesales representatives selling mainly accident & health and individual life products directly to consumers. We also work with brokers and independent agents on sales of group and individual life, accident & health, group medical, dental and pension products, and worksite marketing.\n11\nEMEA\nOur EMEA segment offers products to individuals, corporations, other institutions, and their respective employees. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company's disposition of Joint-stock Company MetLife Insurance Company (“MetLife Russia”).\nWe operate across EMEA in both developed (Western Europe) and emerging (Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa) markets. Our largest operations are in the U.K., Turkey and the Gulf region. In more mature markets, we focus our strategy on our preferred market segments to play a “niche” role. We also have a strong market presence in emerging markets leveraging a multi-channel distribution strategy.\nOur businesses in EMEA use captive and independent agency, independent brokerage, bancassurance, corporate solutions and direct-to-consumer distribution channels.\nMetLife Holdings\nThis segment consists of operations relating to products and businesses that we no longer actively market in the United States. These include variable, universal, term and whole life insurance, variable, fixed and index-linked annuities, and long-term care insurance. It also includes assumed variable annuity guarantees from our former operating joint venture in Japan.\n12\nCorporate & Other\nCorporate & Other contains various start-up, developing and run-off businesses. Also included in Corporate & Other are: the excess capital, as well as certain charges and activities, not allocated to the segments (including external integration and disposition costs, internal resource costs for associates committed to acquisitions and dispositions and enterprise-wide strategic initiative restructuring charges), interest expense related to the majority of the Company’s outstanding debt, expenses associated with certain legal proceedings and income tax audit issues, the elimination of intersegment amounts (which generally relate to affiliated reinsurance, investment expenses and intersegment loans, bearing interest rates commensurate with related borrowings), and the Company’s investment management business (through which the Company provides public fixed income, private capital and real estate investment solutions to institutional investors worldwide).\nPolicyholder Liabilities\nWe establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations when a policy matures or is surrendered, an insured dies or becomes disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events, or to provide for future annuity payments. Our liabilities for future policy benefits and claims are established based on estimates by actuaries of how much we will need to pay for future benefits and claims. For life insurance and annuity products, we calculate these liabilities based on assumptions and estimates, including estimated premiums to be received over the assumed life of the policy, the timing of the event covered by the insurance policy, the amount of benefits or claims to be paid and the investment returns on the investments we make with the premiums we receive. We establish liabilities for claims and benefits based on assumptions and estimates of losses and liabilities incurred. Amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported on the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. For more details on policyholder liabilities see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Liability for Future Policy Benefits” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Policyholder Liabilities.”\nMetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries, including affiliated captive reinsurers, establish statutory reserves under methods prescribed by insurance laws. These reserves are reported as liabilities, and we expect them to be sufficient to meet policy and contract obligations, when taken together with expected future premiums and interest at assumed rates. Statutory reserves and actuarial liabilities for future policy benefits reported under GAAP generally differ due to the difference in accounting requirements.\nU.S. state insurance laws and regulations require certain MetLife entities to submit an annual opinion and memorandum of a qualified actuary. In it, the qualified actuary states that the statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts recorded in support of specified policies and contracts, and the assets supporting such statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts, adequately provide for the anticipated cash flow required to meet contractual obligations and related expenses.\nInsurance regulators in many of the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate require certain MetLife entities to prepare and submit a sufficiency analysis of the reserves presented in the locally required regulatory financial statements. See “— Regulation — Insurance Regulation — Policy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis.”\nUnderwriting and Pricing\nWe use a variety of underwriting and pricing management controls. Our Global Risk Management Department develops product pricing standards and oversees underwriting practices in MetLife’s insurance businesses. We also regularly conduct experience studies to monitor assumptions against expectations, impose formal new product approval processes, periodically update product profitability studies, and use reinsurance to manage our exposures, as appropriate. See “— Reinsurance Activity.”\nUnderwriting\nOur underwriters and actuaries use detailed underwriting policies, guidelines and procedures to assess and quantify insurance risks, and determine the type and the amount of risk we are willing to accept.\nInsurance underwriters consider an applicant’s medical history and other factors such as financial profile, foreign travel, vocations and alcohol, drug and tobacco use. Group insurance underwriters generally evaluate the risk characteristics of the prospective insured group, but may underwrite members of a group on an individual basis for certain voluntary products and coverages. Our own employees generally perform our underwriting, but intermediaries review certain policies under guidelines established by us. Generally, we are not obligated to accept any risk or group of risks from, or to issue a policy or group of policies to, any employer or intermediary. We review requests for coverage on their merits and issue policies only after we have examined and approved the particular risk or group under our underwriting guidelines.\n13\nWe periodically review all our underwriting to maintain high standards of quality and consistency. Our reinsurers generally have the right to audit our underwriting.\nWe use underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies, and strategies that we intend to be competitive and suitable for the customer, the agent and us, to facilitate quality sales, and to serve our customers’ needs while supporting our financial strength and business objectives. We aim to ensure that underwriting risk levels are appropriately reflected in our product pricing.\nFor our Property & Casualty business, our underwriting function has six principal aspects: evaluating potential voluntary and worksite employer accounts and independent agencies; establishing guidelines for the binding of risks; reviewing coverage bound by agents; underwriting potential insureds, on a case by case basis, presented by agents outside the scope of their binding authority; pursuing information necessary in certain cases to enable issuance of a policy within our guidelines; and ensuring that renewal policies continue to be written at rates commensurate with risk. Subject to very few exceptions, agents in each of the distribution channels have binding authority for risks which fall within our published underwriting guidelines. Risks falling outside the underwriting guidelines may be submitted for approval to the underwriting department; alternatively, agents in such a situation may call the underwriting department to obtain authorization to bind the risk themselves. In most states, we generally have the right within a specified period (usually the first 60 days) to cancel any policy.\nWe continually review our underwriting guidelines in light of applicable regulations and to ensure that our policies remain competitive, support our marketing strategies and profitability goals, and otherwise remain appropriate.\nPricing\nProduct pricing reflects our globally-consistent standards. Global Risk Management and regional finance and product teams’ price and oversee all of our insurance businesses. We base our pricing on the expected benefits payout which we calculate through the use of assumptions for mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency and investment returns and macroeconomic factors such as inflation. We price investment-oriented products based on factors such as investment returns, expenses, persistency, optionality, and possible variability of results.\nOur pricing of certain products may include prospective and retrospective experience rating features. For prospective experience rating, we evaluate past experience to determine future premium rates and we bear all prior year gains and losses. For retrospective experience rating, we evaluate past experience to determine our cost of providing insurance for the customer in light of any features that allow us to recoup certain losses or distribute certain gains back to the policyholder based on prior years’ experience.\nWe base our rates for group benefit products on anticipated earnings and expenses for the book of business. We generally re-evaluate renewals annually or biannually and re-price products to reflect our experience on such products.\nWe price RIS products on demand. Our pricing reflects our expected investment returns, as well as mortality, longevity and expense assumptions. RIS business is generally nonparticipating and illiquid, as policyholders have few or no options or contractual rights to cash values. However for our stable value business, pricing reflects the contractholders ability to withdraw at book value over a period of time as well as our ability to reset rates periodically.\nWe generally must receive regulatory approval of rates for individual life insurance products. Such rates are highly regulated, even where we are not required to obtain advance regulatory approval. We generally renew such products annually, and they may include pricing terms that are guaranteed for a certain period of time.\nWe price individual disability income products based on anticipated results by occupation.\nOur rates for fixed and variable annuity products are also highly regulated, and we also generally must receive regulatory approval of them. Such products generally include penalties for early withdrawals and policyholder benefit elections to tailor benefits to policyholder needs. We periodically reevaluate the costs of such options and adjust pricing levels on our guarantees. We may also reevaluate the type and level of guarantee features we offer.\n14\nFor our Property & Casualty business, our ability to set and change rates is subject to regulatory oversight. Rates for our major lines of property and casualty insurance are based on our proprietary database, rather than relying on rating bureaus. We determine prices in part from a number of variables specific to each risk. The pricing of personal lines insurance products takes into account, among other things, the expected frequency and severity of losses, the costs of providing coverage (including the costs of acquiring policyholders and administering policy benefits and other administrative and overhead costs such as reinsurance), competitive factors and profit considerations. The major pricing variables for personal lines insurance include characteristics of the insured property, such as age, make and model or construction type, as well as characteristics of the insureds, such as driving record and loss experience, and the insured’s personal financial management. As a condition of our license to do business in each state, we, like all other personal lines insurers, are required to write or share the cost of private passenger automobile and homeowners insurance for higher risk individuals who would otherwise be unable to obtain such insurance. This “involuntary” market, also called the “shared market,” is governed by the applicable laws and regulations of each state, and policies written in this market are generally written at rates higher than standard rates and typically afford less coverage.\nWe continually review our pricing guidelines in light of applicable regulations and to ensure that our policies remain competitive, support our marketing strategies and profitability goals, and otherwise remain appropriate.\nReinsurance Activity\nWe enter into reinsurance agreements primarily as a purchaser of reinsurance for our various insurance products. We also provide reinsurance for some third parties’ insurance products. We participate in reinsurance in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to significant risks, and provide additional capacity for future growth. Our reinsurance covers individual risks, group risks, or defined blocks of business, primarily on a coinsurance, yearly renewable term, excess, or catastrophe excess basis. The extent of our retained risks depends on our risk evaluation, subject, in certain circumstances, to maximum retention limits based on our risk appetite. We also cede first dollar mortality risk under certain contracts. We reinsure both mortality and other risks. We obtain reinsurance for capital requirement purposes and when its economic impact makes it appropriate to do so.\nWe also reinsure for risk and capital management purposes among affiliates, including affiliated captive reinsurers. Captive reinsurers are affiliated insurance companies licensed as such under the Special Purpose Financial Captive law adopted by several states, including Vermont and South Carolina. Captive insurers’ very narrow business plans restrict most or all of their activity to reinsuring business from their affiliates. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Capital — Affiliated Captive Reinsurance Transactions.”\nFor information regarding reinsurance by segment, our catastrophic coverage, and ceded reinsurance recoverable balances, included in premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, see Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRegulation\nOverview\nIn the United States (“U.S.”), state regulators primarily regulate our life insurance companies, with additional federal regulation of some products and services. The insurance holding company laws of various U.S. jurisdictions apply to MetLife, Inc. and its U.S. insurance subsidiaries. Furthermore, consumer protection laws, privacy, anti-money laundering, securities, broker-dealer and investment adviser regulations, environmental and unclaimed property laws and regulations, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) also apply to some of MetLife’s operations, products and services.\nOutside of the U.S., insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which our insurance businesses are located or operate principally regulate those businesses. In addition, securities, pension, and other authorities oversee our investment and pension companies where they operate. Regulators also subject our non-U.S. insurance businesses to current and developing solvency regimes, which impose various capital and other requirements. Additionally, regulators may enhance their capital standards, enhance their supervision, and impose additional non-U.S. and global regulatory initiatives.\nWe expect the scope and extent of regulation and regulatory oversight generally to continue to increase. The regulatory environment and changes in laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially harm our results of operations.\n15\nInsurance Regulation\nInsurance regulation generally aims to protect policyholders and ensure insurance company solvency. Insurance regulators increasingly seek information about the potential impact of activities on holding company systems as a whole, and some jurisdictions have asserted “group-wide” supervision, including model laws and regulations developed through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (“NAIC”) Solvency Modernization Initiative. See “— National Association of Insurance Commissioners” regarding group-wide supervision.\nEach of MetLife’s insurance subsidiaries is licensed and regulated in each jurisdiction where it conducts insurance business. The extent of such regulation varies, but most jurisdictions regulate the financial aspects and business conduct of insurers through broad administrative powers with respect to, amongst other things:\n•\nlicensing companies and agents to transact business;\n•\ncalculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements;\n•\nmandating certain insurance benefits;\n•\nregulating certain premium rates;\n•\nreviewing and approving certain policy forms, including required policyholder disclosures;\n•\nregulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements, and identifying and paying to the states or local authorities benefits and other property that is not claimed by the owners;\n•\nregulating advertising;\n•\nprotecting and safeguarding personal information and other sensitive data, including through cybersecurity standards;\n•\nestablishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards;\n•\nspecifying the conditions under which a ceding company can take credit for reinsurance in its statutory financial statements (i.e., reduce its reserves by the amount of reserves ceded to a reinsurer);\n•\nfixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts;\n•\nadopting and enforcing sales standards with respect to the sale of annuities and other insurance products;\n•\napproving changes in control of insurance companies;\n•\nrestricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; and\n•\nregulating the types and amounts of investments.\nEach insurance subsidiary must file reports, generally including detailed annual financial statements, with insurance regulatory authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which it does business. Such authorities also periodically examine its operations and accounts. These subsidiaries must also file, and in many jurisdictions and in some lines of insurance obtain regulatory approval of, rules, rates, and policy forms relating to the insurance written in the jurisdictions in which they operate.\nInsurance, securities, and other regulatory authorities, other law enforcement agencies, and attorneys general, review MetLife, Inc. and its insurance subsidiaries for compliance with laws and regulations regarding the conduct of our insurance and securities businesses. We cooperate with such inquiries and take corrective action when warranted. See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n16\nIn 2020, many government actors and insurance regulators issued regulations, bulletins, directives and guidance in connection with the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic (the “COVID-19 Pandemic”), some of which have since expired. These encourage, request or direct health, life, and property and casualty insurance companies to waive cost-sharing for coronavirus COVID-19 testing, cover telehealth services, provide extended grace periods for premium payments, forbear on the cancellation or non-renewal of policies due to non-payment of premium, expand coverage for state-mandated disability and family leave benefits to address COVID-19-related events, and provide other policyholder accommodations. For example, the New York State Department of Financial Services (\"NYDFS\") required life insurance- or annuity- authorized insurers to extend premium and fee payment grace periods to 90 days for policyholders who demonstrated COVID-19 Pandemic-related financial hardship. The NYDFS also prohibited New York licensed insurers from imposing any late fees on or reporting policyholders to a credit reporting or debt collection agency for failure to timely pay any life or annuity premiums, and required such insurers to allow policyholders to pay the premium over a 12-month period. Insurers were required to accept a policyholder’s written attestation as proof of financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nU.S. Federal Initiatives\nU.S. federal initiatives often affect our business in a variety of ways, including regulation of financial services, securities, derivatives, pensions, health care, money laundering, foreign sanctions and corrupt practices, and taxation. In addition, legislators and policymakers propose various forms of direct and indirect federal regulation of insurance from time to time, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies. See “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Changes in Laws or Regulation, or in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies, May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us.”\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) increased the potential federal role in regulating businesses such as ours, including in the following ways:\n•\nThe Financial Stability Oversight Council may designate certain financial companies as non-bank systemically important financial institutions (“non-bank SIFI”) subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board”) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (collectively with the Federal Reserve Board, the “Federal Reserve”).\n•\nThe Federal Insurance Office within the Department of the Treasury may participate in the negotiations of international insurance agreements with foreign regulators for the U.S., collect information about the insurance industry, and recommend prudential standards.\n•\nIf an insurance holding company such as MetLife, Inc. or another non-insurance financial institution were to become insolvent or were in danger of defaulting on its obligations, and regulators determined that this would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the U.S., then the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) may liquidate such a company as receiver. In that case, the Bankruptcy Code, which ordinarily governs liquidations, would not apply. The FDIC’s purpose would be to mitigate the systemic risks the institution’s failure poses. This is a different objective from that of a bankruptcy trustee under the Bankruptcy Code. In such a liquidation, the holders of such company’s debt could in certain respects be treated differently than under the Bankruptcy Code. The FDIC has established rules relating to the priority of creditors’ claims and the potentially dissimilar treatment of similarly situated creditors. These provisions could apply to some financial institutions whose outstanding debt securities we hold in our investment portfolios. However, state insurance laws would continue to apply to an insurance company resolution.\n•\nDodd-Frank provisions may also affect the investments and investment activities of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including imposing federal regulation of such activities.\nDodd-Frank and its implementing regulations have changed since the law was adopted. As a result of these changes, and potential changes, we cannot identify all the risks and opportunities, if any, they pose to our businesses. See “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Changes in Laws or Regulation, or in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies, May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us.”\n17\nThe federal government's 2020 response to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected us. For example, the U.S. federal government established paid sick leave and expanded other leave laws to cover certain COVID-19 Pandemic related events. The U.S. federal government also added certain tax-favored withdrawals and increased loan withdrawal limitations from eligible retirement plans, and temporarily waived required minimum distribution rules for qualified retirement plan participants and Individual Retirement Accounts (“IRA”) owners. We also granted concessions to certain of our commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loan borrowers, including payment deferrals and other loan modifications, as well as to certain of our lessees (operating and direct financing leases), primarily in the form of rent deferrals. In addition, we have made certain accounting elections regarding loan and lease concessions related to the Federal Government’s pandemic relief efforts. See “Investments — Mortgage Loans — Mortgage Loan Concessions” and “Investments — Leases — Lease Concessions” in Note 8 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUntil January 2021, the McCarran–Ferguson Act largely exempted insurance from U.S. antitrust laws. At that time, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act applied U.S. antitrust laws to the “business of health insurance” and expanded U.S. regulatory authority accordingly. We expect regulatory oversight and litigation risk for U.S. products, including dental and vision, to increase.\nHealth Care Regulation\nThe U.S. excise tax known as the “health insurer fee” was in force for the 2020 calendar year (though not for 2019). The health insurer fee no longer applies for calendar years beginning after December 31, 2020. However, demand for and pricing of products remain subject to tax uncertainty. Federal health care statutes and related regulation have imposed increased and unpredictable costs on certain products and may have additional adverse effects. They have also harmed our competitive position, as these rules have a disparate impact on our products compared to products offered by our not-for-profit competitors. See “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Changes in Laws or Regulation, or in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies, May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us.”\nGuaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements\nMany jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries transact business require life, health and property and casualty insurers to participate in guaranty or similar associations. These arrangements pay certain insurance benefits owed by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. We have established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments that we consider adequate. See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the guaranty association assessments.\nInsurance Regulatory Examinations and Other Activities\nU.S. state insurance departments periodically examine the books, records, accounts, and business practices of their domiciled insurers. State insurance departments may also conduct examinations of non-domiciliary insurers licensed in their states.\nIn 2019, MetLife entered into a consent order with the NYDFS relating to the open market conduct quinquennial exam and paid a fine and customer restitution and submitted remediation plans for approval. Except for this consent order or as described in Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, MetLife did not receive any material adverse findings resulting from state insurance department examinations of its insurance subsidiaries.\nIn 2018, Pennsylvania, California, Florida, North Dakota and New Hampshire insurance regulators scheduled a multistate market conduct re-examination of MetLife and its affiliates relating to compliance with a regulatory settlement agreement on unclaimed proceeds. This examination is ongoing.\nRegulatory authorities in a small number of states, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and, occasionally, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) have conducted investigations or made inquiries relating to sales of individual life insurance policies, annuities or other products written by our insurance or broker-dealer subsidiaries. These investigations often focus on the conduct and/or supervision of particular financial services representatives, the sale of unregistered or unsuitable products, the misuse of client assets, or sales and replacements of annuities and certain riders on such annuities. Over the past several years, we resolved these (and a number of investigations by other regulators) for monetary payments and certain other relief, including restitution payments. We may continue to receive, and may resolve, further investigations and actions on these matters in a similar manner.\n18\nInsurance standard-setting and regulatory support organizations, including the NAIC, encourage insurance supervisors to establish Supervisory Colleges. These organizations facilitate cooperation and coordination among insurance supervisors to enhance their understanding of the risk profile of U.S.-based insurance groups with international operations. MetLife’s lead state regulator, the NYDFS, regularly chairs Supervisory College meetings that MetLife’s key U.S. and non-U.S. regulators attend.\nRegulators supervise our non-U.S. insurance and pension businesses through periodic examinations of insurance company books and records, financial reporting requirements, market conduct examinations and policy filing requirements. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (“EIOPA”), along with European legislation, requires European regulators, such as the Central Bank of Ireland, to establish Supervisory Colleges for European Economic Area (“EEA”)-based insurance groups with significant European operations, including MetLife. These colleges facilitate cooperation and coordination among European supervisors to enhance their understanding of an insurance group’s risk profile.\nIn 2019, we and other insurance and pension fund companies provided annuities sales practices information to the Chilean insurance and pension regulators. The regulators found that non-employee sales agents of MetLife Chile and other insurers had engaged in improper sales practices and that ProVida S.A. and other pension fund companies provided improper advice to customers. MetLife Chile and ProVida S.A. are contesting the regulators’ proposed fines.\nIn addition, regulators have scrutinized insurers’ claims payment practices. See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding group annuity benefits, retained asset accounts and unclaimed property inquiries, including pension benefits.\nPolicy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis\nOur U.S. insurance subsidiaries, including affiliated captive reinsurers, must annually analyze their statutory reserves adequacy. In each case, a qualified actuary must submit an opinion that states that the statutory reserves make adequate provision, according to accepted actuarial standards of practice, for the anticipated cash flows required by the contractual obligations and related expenses of the U.S. insurance subsidiary. The actuary considers the adequacy of the statutory reserves in light of the assets held by the insurer with respect to such reserves and related actuarial items, such as the investment earnings on such assets and the consideration the insurer anticipates receiving and retaining under the related policies and contracts. We may increase reserves in order to submit such an opinion without qualification. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries that must provide these opinions have done so without qualifications since this requirement began.\nMany of our non-U.S. insurance operations must also analyze the adequacy of their statutory reserves. In most of those cases, a locally qualified actuary must submit an analysis of the likelihood that the reserves make adequate provision for the insurer’s associated contractual obligations and related expenses. Regulatory and actuarial analytic standards vary widely.\nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners\nThe NAIC assists U.S. state insurance regulatory authorities to serve the public interest and achieve their regulatory goals. State insurance regulators may act independently or adopt regulations proposed by the NAIC. State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine existing insurance laws and regulations. State insurance regulators establish standards and best practices, conduct peer reviews, and coordinate their regulatory oversight through the NAIC. The NAIC also provides standardized insurance industry accounting and reporting guidance through its Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual (the “Manual”), which states have largely adopted by regulation. However, individual states establish statutory accounting principles, which may differ from the Manual. Changes to the Manual or modifications by the various state insurance departments may affect the statutory capital and surplus of MetLife, Inc.’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries.\n19\nU.S. state insurance holding company laws and regulations are generally based on the NAIC Model Holding Company Act and Regulation. These vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally require a controlled insurance company (i.e., insurers that are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies) to register and file reports with state regulatory authorities on its capital structure, ownership, financial condition, intercompany transactions and general business operations. They require the ultimate controlling person of a U.S. insurer to file an annual enterprise risk report with the lead state of the insurance holding company system. This report identifies risks likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. Each of our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states has enacted laws to implement these requirements, including the enterprise risk reporting requirement. The holding company laws also authorize state insurance commissioners to act as global group-wide supervisors for internationally active insurance groups (“IAIGs”), as well as other insurers that choose to opt in for the group-wide supervision. These laws provide confidentiality protection for communications with the group-wide supervisor. Nearly all states have adopted laws and regulations enhancing group-wide supervision. In 2020, the NYDFS amended its laws to permit the New York Superintendent of Financial Services (“Superintendent”) to act as a group-wide supervisor for IAIGs.\nIn furtherance of the NAIC’s “Solvency Modernization Initiative,” the NAIC has updated model acts and regulations to address insurance company financial regulation, and in particular capital requirements; corporate governance and risk management practices; group supervision; liquidity stress testing, statutory accounting and financial reporting; and reinsurance.\nThe NAIC’s Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Act requires insurers to annually file detailed information regarding their corporate governance policies. As of December 31, 2020, it had been substantially adopted by most states.\nEach of our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states has also adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act, which requires insurers to maintain a risk management framework and to document an internal own risk and solvency assessment (“ORSA”) of its material risks in normal and stressed environments. MetLife, Inc. has submitted on behalf of the enterprise an ORSA summary report to the NYDFS annually since this requirement became effective.\nThe NAIC has also approved a valuation manual containing a principle-based approach to the calculation of life insurance reserves (the “Valuation Manual”). Principle-based reserving (“PBR”) is designed to better address reserving for life insurance and annuity products. Principle-based reserving has been adopted by all the domiciliary states of MetLife’s insurance subsidiaries. The NYDFS promulgated a regulation in 2019 that affirms the Superintendent’s authority to deviate from the Valuation Manual to adjust the reserves of a New York domestic life insurance company, such as MLIC, if the NYDFS determines that an alternative requirement would be in the best interest of New York policyholders. In February 2020, the NYDFS amended the regulation. As a result, as of December 31, 2020, we increased our statutory reserves by approximately $700 million and our statutory capital requirements by approximately $300 million over the prior reserve and capital requirements. We graded these effects into our statutory financial statements over a one year period so the full impact is reflected as of December 31, 2020.\nThe NAIC has been focused on a macro-prudential initiative since 2017, which is intended to enhance risk identification efforts by building on the state-based regulation system. In furtherance of this initiative, the NAIC adopted changes to its Statutory Annual Statement reporting, effective for year-end 2019, to improve liquidity risk monitoring. In December 2020, the NAIC adopted amendments to the Model Holding Company Holding Act and Regulation that implement requirements related to a liquidity stress-testing framework, consistent with MetLife’s liquidity risks policies and procedures, for certain large U.S. life insurers and insurance groups, to be used as a regulatory tool, based on amounts of certain types of business written or material exposure to certain investment transactions, such as derivatives and securities lending. These amendments now have to be adopted by state legislatures to become effective.\nWe use capital markets solutions to finance a portion of our statutory reserve requirements for several products. These include level premium term life product subject to the NAIC’s Valuation of Life Insurance Policies Model Regulation (commonly referred to as Regulation XXX), universal and variable life policies with secondary guarantees (“ULSG”) subject to NAIC Actuarial Guideline 38 (commonly referred to as Guideline AXXX), and MLIC’s closed block. The NAIC created a regulatory framework applicable to the use of captive insurers in connection with Regulation XXX and Guideline AXXX transactions which has enhanced statutory financial statement disclosure of an insurer's use of captives. The framework narrowed the types of assets permitted to back statutory reserves that are required to support the insurer’s future obligations.\n20\nThe NAIC also requires the actuary of a ceding insurer to opine on the insurer’s reserves and to issue a qualified opinion if the framework described above, as set forth in Actuarial Guideline 48 (“AG 48”), is not followed. The NAIC’s Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing Model Regulation contains the same substantive requirements as AG 48, as amended by the NAIC in 2016, and it establishes uniform, national standards governing reserve financing arrangements pertaining to the term life and universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees. This model regulation has only been adopted by a few states, including one of our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states.\nWe cannot predict the capital and reserve impacts, compliance costs, or other effects these initiatives will have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSurplus and Capital\nInsurers must maintain their capital and surplus at or above minimum levels prescribed by the laws of their respective jurisdictions. Regulators generally have discretionary authority to limit or prohibit an insurer’s sales to policyholders if the insurer has not maintained a minimum surplus or capital or if they find that the further transaction of business will be hazardous to policyholders.\nState insurance statutes also typically restrict the dividends or other distributions an insurance company subsidiary may pay to its parent companies and limit the transactions between an insurer and its affiliates. Dividends in excess of prescribed limits and transactions above a specified size between an insurer and its affiliates require the approval of the insurance regulator in the insurer’s state of domicile. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — MetLife, Inc. — Liquidity and Capital Sources — Dividends from Subsidiaries.” See also “Dividend Restrictions” in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding such limitations.\nNon-U.S. jurisdictions also restrict the amount of such dividends and other distributions. For example, a portion of the annual earnings of our Japan operations may be repatriated each year, and may further be distributed to MetLife, Inc. as a dividend. We may determine not to repatriate profits from the Japan operations or to repatriate a reduced amount in order to maintain or improve the solvency of the Japan operations or for other reasons. In addition, the Financial Services Agency in Japan (“FSA”) may limit or not permit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the U.S. if such transfers would be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of our Japan operations or for other reasons.\nSeveral non-U.S. insurance regulators urged insurance companies to preserve funds during the COVID-19 Pandemic. For example, the EIOPA suggested that insurance companies temporarily suspend discretionary dividends during the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nFor developments that could affect our ratio of free cash flow to adjusted earnings results, and thus our surplus and capital, see “Risk Factors.”\nRisk-Based Capital\nMost of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements developed by the NAIC and adopted by their respective domiciliary states. Insurers calculate RBC annually based on a formula that applies factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and statutory reserve items, taking into account asset, insurance, interest rate, and market and business risk characteristics. Regulators use the formula as an early warning tool to identify insurers that may be inadequately capitalized for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. State insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels. We expect our statutory financial statements  to reflect that the total adjusted capital of each of our subsidiaries subject to these requirements was in excess of each of those RBC levels at year-end 2020, as they did for year-end 2019. See “Statutory Equity and Income” in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Capital — Statutory Capital and Dividends.”\nThe NYDFS issues annual letters on Special Considerations (“SCL”) to New York-licensed insurance companies, including MLIC, that affect year-end asset adequacy testing. An SCL could require assumptions that require us to increase or release certain asset adequacy reserves, which could materially impact our statutory capital and surplus. We did not change our statutory capital and surplus in either 2019 or 2020 as a result of the SCL\n.\nSee “Statutory Equity and Income” in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe calculate our internally-defined “Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio” by dividing the sum of total adjusted capital for MetLife, Inc.’s principal U.S. insurance subsidiaries, excluding American Life Insurance Company\n21\n(“American Life”), by the sum of company action level RBC for such subsidiaries, including SCL considerations. Our Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio was in excess of 350% at December 31, 2020 and in excess of 360% at December 31, 2019. By contrast, we calculate an “NAIC-Based Combined RBC Ratio” based on such subsidiaries’ statutory-based filed financial statements and NAIC capital and reserving standards. This NAIC-Based Combined RBC Ratio was in excess of 380% at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. We are not aware of any upcoming NAIC adoptions or state insurance department regulation changes that would have a material impact on our NAIC-Based Combined RBC Ratio.\nThe NAIC adopted revisions to certain factors used to calculate Life RBC, which is the denominator of the RBC ratios, in light of changes to U.S. tax laws in recent years. These revisions have resulted in increased RBC charges and reduced the RBC ratios of our insurance subsidiaries. The NAIC is also studying RBC revisions for real estate equity, bonds and longevity risk, but it is premature to project the impact of any potential regulatory changes resulting from such proposals.\nThe NAIC developed a group capital calculation tool using an RBC aggregation methodology for all entities within the insurance holding company system, including non-U.S. entities. In December 2020, the NAIC adopted the Group Capital Calculation Template and Instructions, as well as amendments to the Model Holding Company Act and Regulation. The amendments implement the annual filing requirement for the group capital calculation that now have to be adopted by state legislatures or regulatory agencies to become effective. We cannot predict what impact such regulatory tool may have on our business.\nIn 2020, the NAIC issued guidance on RBC addressing debt restructuring due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, where the counterparty might seek concessions. The guidance provides that an insurer does not need to reclassify the RBC category of some loans or other assets on which it has granted a concession. This may avoid a higher capital charge for the asset. The NAIC extended this guidance through January 1, 2022 in further support of the use of prudent loan modifications to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nSolvency Regimes\nOur insurance business throughout the EEA is subject to the Solvency II Directive and its implementing rules. These cover the capital adequacy, risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers and reinsurers. Solvency II harmonizes insurance regulation across the European Union (“EU”). Each EEA member state has transposed the Solvency II Directive into its regulatory architecture. Its capital requirements are forward-looking and based on the risk profile of each individual insurance company in order to promote comparability, transparency and competitiveness. In line with the requirements, impacted MetLife entities calculate and report their solvency capital requirement using a standard formula prescribed by the Solvency II Directive and further regulation by the European Commission.\nThe U.K. ceased to be a member of the EU in January 2020, and following the expiry of a transition period on December 31, 2020, the U.K. is no longer subject to EU law. The relationship between the U.K. and the EU is now governed by the terms and conditions of a Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the “Trade Agreement”). The Trade Agreement does not contain many substantive provisions relating to financial services and, therefore, there is currently no change to capital adequacy, risk management and regulatory reporting requirements for U.K. authorized insurers and reinsurers. However, it is possible that the U.K.’s domestic prudential regime may begin to diverge from the Solvency II Directive over time. The U.K. is currently undertaking a review of the Solvency II Directive and of the regulatory regime that is applicable to U.K. authorized insurers and reinsurers. We expect to maintain our existing operating model, including as an inbound EEA-insurer, under the U.K.’s Temporary Permissions Regime (“TPR”), which is due to last for at least three years and will permit MetLife to carry on its insurance business in the U.K. during that period.\nMexico has adopted a Solvency II-type regulatory framework which imposes reserve and capital requirements and corporate governance to foster transparency. In line with the requirements of the local Solvency II, insurance companies calculate and report their capital requirement using a standard formula designed by the local regulators (“CNSF”). In addition, as required, certain MetLife entities must submit annual ORSA reports to the CNSF on an ongoing basis.\nIn Chile, the law implementing Solvency II-like regulation continues in the studies stage. The implementation date for the new solvency regime has not yet been set; however, it could be in force within four years after the final regulation is published. MetLife Chile timely implemented governance changes and risk policies to comply with prior regulatory changes. MetLife Chile also submitted its most recent risk appetite framework and ORSA reports to the regulator in December 2020.\n22\nThe Superintendence of Private Insurance, the Brazilian insurance regulator, has established an insurance framework for minimum capital requirements based on risk, criteria for investment activities, a formal risk management function, and a formal enterprise risk management framework. MetLife Brazil has formalized the designation of a local risk manager and implemented governance structures and risk management framework components in accordance with local regulatory requirements.\nJapanese law requires insurers to maintain solvency standards to protect policyholders and to support their own financial strength. Most Japanese life insurers maintain a solvency margin ratio well in excess of the legally mandated minimum. In addition, we expect Japan to introduce an economic value-based solvency regime within the next few years.\nIn China, the business of our joint venture (as well as the industry) has been implementing China Risk Oriented Solvency System (“C-ROSS”), a risk-based solvency regime. Like Solvency II, C-ROSS focuses on risk management and has three pillars (strengthen quantitative capital requirements, enhance qualitative supervision and establish a governance and market discipline process).\nThe Korea Financial Supervisory Service plans to implement a new solvency system by 2023. We expect this system to reflect the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) global Insurance Capital Standard and incorporate certain product portfolio and other features specific to the Korean market. We also expect this system to include mark-to-market valuation, which would generally increase capital requirements.\nIAIS\nThe IAIS is an association of insurance supervisors and regulators and a member of the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”), an international entity established to coordinate, develop and promote regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. The IAIS participates in the FSB’s initiative to identify and manage systemic risk globally. The IAIS has adopted a holistic framework for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk in the global insurance sector (the “Holistic Framework”). The framework monitors the build-up of vulnerabilities at jurisdictional and global levels to address any such risk through the application of enhanced supervisory measures based on existing insurance core principles and the common framework for supervision of IAIGs. The FSB annually designated MetLife, Inc. a globally systemically important insurer (“G-SII”) from 2016 to 2019, but the FSB suspended our G-SII identification beginning in 2020. The FSB may discontinue or re-establish the G-SII designation system based on the implementation results of the Holistic Framework.\nAn IAIS proposal becomes effective when it is enacted through legislation or regulation in the applicable jurisdiction. As MetLife, Inc. is not a U.S. non-bank SIFI, the impact on MetLife, Inc. of the IAIS’s global proposals is uncertain.\nNew York Insurance Regulation 210\nInsurance Regulation 210 establishes standards for the determination and any readjustment of non-guaranteed elements (“NGEs”) that may vary at the insurer’s discretion for life insurance policies and annuity contracts delivered or issued for delivery in New York. NGEs include cost of insurance for universal life insurance policies, as well as interest crediting rates for annuities and universal life insurance policies. The regulation requires insurers to notify policyholders at least 60 days in advance of any change in NGEs that is adverse to policyholders and, with respect to life insurance, to notify the NYDFS at least 120 days prior to any such changes. The regulation also requires insurers to inform the NYDFS annually of any changes adverse to policyholders made in the prior year. The regulation generally prohibits insurers from increasing profit margins for in-force policies or adjusting NGEs in order to recoup past losses.\nCybersecurity and Privacy Regulation\nVarious U.S. federal and state government agencies protect the privacy and security of personal information. A number of jurisdictions outside the U.S. safeguard the privacy and security of personal information. These laws and rules vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Insurance and other regulators are also increasingly focused on cybersecurity.\nNew York’s cybersecurity regulation for financial services institutions, including banking and insurance entities under its jurisdiction, requires these entities to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers’ private data. The regulation requires covered entities to assess risks associated with their information systems and establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of such systems and data. Specifically, it provides for: (i) controls relating to the governance framework for a cybersecurity program; (ii) risk-based minimum standards for technology systems for data protection; (iii) minimum standards for cyber breach responses, including notice to the NYDFS of material events; and (iv) identification and documentation of material deficiencies, remediation plans and annual certifications of regulatory compliance to the NYDFS.\n23\nThe NAIC’s Insurance Data Security Model Law (the “Cybersecurity Model Law”) established standards for data security and for the investigation of and notification of insurance commissioners of cybersecurity events involving unauthorized access to, or the misuse of, certain nonpublic information. The Cybersecurity Model Law imposes regulatory requirements intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems. Several states have adopted the Cybersecurity Model Law, including some of our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states.\nCalifornia residents have the right to know what information a business has collected from them and the sourcing and sharing of that information. They also have a right to have a business delete their personal information (with some exceptions), and in certain instances, to limit the use of their personal information. Regulators may impose fines for violations, and individuals have a private right of action for any unauthorized disclosure of personal information as a result of failure to maintain reasonable security procedures. While a significant portion of our business is exempted from these specific requirements, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the insurance laws of several states grant similar rights to insureds.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) establishes uniform data privacy laws across the EU. The U.K. Data Protection Act of 2018 (“U.K. GDPR”) implements provisions of the GDPR with respect to personal data originating from within the U.K. GDPR and the U.K. GDPR apply to EU and U.K. entities, respectively, as well as entities not established in the EU and/or the U.K., that offer goods or services to data subjects in the EU and/or the U.K., or monitor consumer behavior that takes place in the EU and/or the U.K. Regulators may impose fines for non-compliance. Following the U.K.’s exit from the EU, the U.K. GDPR may diverge from GDPR over time.\nERISA, Fiduciary Considerations, and Other Pension and Retirement Regulation\nWe provide products and services to certain employee benefit plans that are subject to ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). ERISA and the Code impose restrictions, including fiduciary duties to perform solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries, and to avoid certain prohibited transactions. The applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code are subject to enforcement by the U.S. Department of Labor (“DOL”), the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\nThe prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and the Code generally restrict the provision of investment advice to ERISA plans and participants and IRAs if the investment recommendation results in fees paid to an individual advisor, the firm that employs the advisor or their affiliates that vary according to the investment recommendation chosen, unless an exemption or exception is available. Similarly, without an exemption or exception, fiduciary advisors are prohibited from receiving compensation from third parties in connection with their advice. ERISA also affects certain of our in-force insurance policies and annuity contracts, as well as insurance policies and annuity contracts we may sell in the future.\nThe SEC adopted Regulation Best Interest in 2020, requiring broker-dealers to act in the best interest of individual investor retail clients when recommending securities or investment strategies, including recommendations to IRA owners, as well as non-benefit plan retail clients. In addition, broker-dealers and investment advisers to retail clients must describe their services and conflicts of interest to their retail customers in client relationship summary disclosure and deliver a copy of the Form to their retail customers. In December 2020, the DOL released the final version of the prohibited transaction exemption (“PTE”) 2020-02 to allow investment advice fiduciaries to receive compensation without violating ERISA, subject to impartial conduct standards and disclosure obligations aligned with the new SEC rules. In the preamble to PTE 2020-02, the DOL also provided its final interpretation of the five-part test used to determine whether a person is acting as an ERISA investment advice fiduciary. PTE 2020-02 became effective on February 16, 2021. The new US presidential administration has ordered a pause on regulatory changes initiated before it took office. As a result, it may delay, change, or withdraw this rule.\nState regulators and legislatures in Nevada, New Jersey, Maryland and New York have proposed measures that would make broker-dealers, sales agents, and investment advisers and their representatives subject to a fiduciary duty when providing products and services to customers, including pension plans and IRAs, and Massachusetts has enacted a law to that effect. The NYDFS’s regulation incorporates the “best interest” standard and expands the scope of the regulation beyond annuity transactions to include sales of life insurance policies to consumers. This Regulation Best Interest under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”) does not include a private right of action, although the SEC did not indicate an intent to pre-empt state regulation in this area, and some of the state proposals and adopted regulations would allow for a private right of action. As a result of these developments, it is possible that it may become more costly to provide our products and services in the states subject to the new rules.\nIn 2020, the Chilean Congress approved two bills, each one of which allowed individuals to withdraw up to 10% of pension accounts or the account balance if it is below a certain amount. ProVida S.A. and other companies in the industry continue to process such payments. Chile also continues to consider further pension reforms that could affect our business.\n24\nConsumer Protection Laws\nNumerous federal and state laws affect our earnings and activities, including federal and state consumer protection laws. As part of Dodd-Frank, Congress established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) to supervise and regulate institutions that provide certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services subject to the CFPB’s jurisdiction generally exclude insurance business of the kind in which we engage, the CFPB does have authority to regulate non-insurance consumer services we provide. Consumer protection laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions may also affect us.\nInvestments Regulation\nState laws and regulations limit the amount of investments that our U.S. insurance subsidiaries may have in certain asset categories, such as below investment grade fixed income securities, real estate equity, other equity investments, and derivatives, and require diversification of investment portfolios. Investments exceeding regulatory limitations are not admitted for purposes of measuring surplus. In some instances, laws require us to divest any non-qualifying investments. In addition, many of our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries and pension companies are subject to other investment laws and regulations.\nChanging global financial and economic environments, and the fiscal and monetary policy of governments and central banks around the world, continue to affect our global insurance business. These may affect interest rates, and thereby the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments, as well as our business operations, investment portfolio, and derivatives.\nDerivatives Regulation\nDodd-Frank includes a framework of regulation of the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets requiring clearing of certain types of interest rate and credit default swap transactions and imposes additional costs, including reporting and margin requirements. Our costs of risk mitigation are increasing under Dodd-Frank. For example, Dodd-Frank imposes requirements to pledge variation and/or initial margin (i) for “OTC-cleared” transactions (OTC derivatives that are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties), and (ii) for “OTC-bilateral” transactions (OTC derivatives that are bilateral contracts between two counterparties); the margin requirements for OTC-cleared transactions and the variation margin requirements for OTC-bilateral derivatives are already in effect, while the initial margin requirements for OTC-bilateral swap transactions are expected to become applicable to us in September 2021.\nWe expect increased margin requirements, and capital charges for our counterparties and central clearinghouses related to holding non-cash collateral, to continue to increase our required holdings of cash and government securities. This may cause lower yields and reduce our income due to less favorable pricing for OTC-cleared and OTC-bilateral transactions. Centralized clearing of certain OTC derivatives exposes us to the risk of a default by a clearing member or clearinghouse with respect to our cleared derivative transactions. We use derivatives to mitigate a wide range of risks in connection with our businesses, including the impact of increased benefit exposures from certain of our annuity products that offer guaranteed benefits. We have always been subject to the risk that hedging and other management procedures might prove ineffective in reducing the risks to which insurance policies expose us, or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events, could produce economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed. Any such losses could be increased by higher costs of writing derivatives (including customized derivatives) and the reduced availability of customized derivatives that might result from the implementation of Dodd-Frank and comparable international derivatives regulations.\nDodd-Frank also expanded the definition of “swap” and mandated the SEC and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) to study whether “stable value contracts” should be treated as swaps. Pursuant to the new definition and the SEC’s and CFTC’s interpretive regulations, products offered by our insurance subsidiaries other than stable value contracts might also be treated as swaps. Should such products become regulated as swaps, we cannot predict how the rules would be applied to them or the effect on such products’ profitability or attractiveness to our clients. Special federal banking rules apply to certain qualified financial contracts, including many derivatives contracts, securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements, with banking institutions and certain of their affiliates. These rules generally require the banking institutions and their applicable affiliates to limit or delay their counterparties default rights (such as the right to terminate the contracts or foreclose on collateral) and restrict assignments and transfers of credit enhancements (such as guarantees) in connection with the banking institution or affiliate bankruptcy, insolvency, resolution or similar proceeding. These rules could limit our recovery in the event of a default, limit our ability to close-out transactions upon the bankruptcy of an affiliate of our counterparty, and increase our counterparty risk.\n25\nWe expect the amount of collateral we are required to pledge and the payments we are required to make under our OTC swaps transactions to increase as a result of the requirement to pledge initial margin for OTC-bilateral transactions, based on the final margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives.\nThe SEC’s Capital Requirements for Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants are scheduled to take effect in October 2021. However, we do not expect these requirements to affect our business significantly.\nSecurities, Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation\nU.S. federal and state securities laws and regulations apply to insurance products that are also “securities,” including variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies, and certain fixed interest rate or index-linked contracts with features that require them to be deemed as securities or sold through private placement issuances. As a result, some of our subsidiaries and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance contracts and policies are subject to extensive regulation under these securities laws.\nFederal and state securities laws and regulations generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and enforcement powers, including the power to adopt new rules impacting new or existing products, regulate the issuance, sale and distribution of our products and limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, some of our insurance products are considered “securities” under local law, and we may be subject to local securities regulations and oversight by local securities regulators.\nSome of our subsidiaries and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance products are subject to extensive regulation under the federal securities laws and regulations administered by the SEC. These subsidiaries issue variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies through separate accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, amended (the “Investment Company Act”) or are exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act. Such separate accounts are generally divided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is itself a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act. In addition, the variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies associated with these registered separate accounts are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or are exempt from registration under the Securities Act. One insurance subsidiary issues a fixed interest rate contract with features that require it to be registered as a security under the Securities Act.\nSome of our subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Exchange Act and are members of, and subject to regulation by, FINRA. Certain variable contract separate accounts sponsored by our subsidiaries are exempt from registration but may be subject to other provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC, CFTC and FINRA from time to time propose rules and regulations that impact products deemed to be securities.\nOne of our U.S. subsidiaries is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and is also registered as an investment adviser in various states and non-U.S. jurisdictions, as applicable. In addition, we have other non-U.S. subsidiaries that are registered or licensed in non-U.S. jurisdictions to conduct our investment management business. We may also be subject to similar laws and regulations in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we provide investment advisory services or conduct other activities.\nUnder SEC rules, broker-dealers recommending our variable products and other securities offerings to retail customers are required to comply with a “best interest” standard. The rule also requires broker-dealers to disclose the nature of services, their standard of conduct, and their conflicts of interest to their retail customers. With regard to insurance products, the NAIC revised its Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Regulation to add a “best interest” standard for the sale of annuities, but only one of our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states has adopted it and it is under consideration in another domiciliary state.\nFederal and state securities regulatory authorities and FINRA from time to time make inquiries and conduct examinations regarding compliance by MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries with securities and other laws and regulations. We cooperate with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action when warranted.\n26\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nAs an owner and operator of real property in many jurisdictions, we are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations in such jurisdictions. Inherent in such ownership and operation is also the risk that there may be environmental liabilities and costs in connection with any required remediation of such properties. In addition, we hold equity interests in companies that could potentially be subject to environmental liabilities. We routinely have environmental assessments performed with respect to real estate being acquired for investment and real property to be acquired through foreclosure. Unexpected environmental liabilities may arise. However, based on information currently available to us, we believe that any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any remediation of such properties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe NYDFS announced that it expects insurers to integrate financial risks from climate change into their governance frameworks, risk management processes, and business strategies. The NYDFS will also publish detailed guidance on climate-related financial supervision and will integrate questions on this topic into their examinations in 2021.\nUnclaimed Property\nWe are subject to the laws and regulations of states and other jurisdictions concerning identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned funds, and are subject to audit and examination for compliance with these requirements. See “— Insurance Regulation — Insurance Regulatory Examinations and Other Activities,” which references the regulatory settlement agreement relating to unclaimed proceeds. See also “Controls and Procedures” and Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBrighthouse Separation Tax Treatment\nPrior to the spin-off distribution of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Brighthouse”) common stock in 2017, we received a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain significant issues under the Code, as well as an opinion from tax counsel that the distribution qualified for non-recognition of gain or loss to us and our shareholders pursuant to Sections 355 and 361 of the Code, except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares, each subject to the accuracy of and compliance with certain representations, assumptions and covenants therein.\nNotwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the tax opinion, the IRS could determine that the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction, for example, if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or covenants on which the private letter ruling is based are untrue or have been violated. Similarly, the IRS could determine that our disposal of the fair value option of Brighthouse Financial, Inc.’s common stock in the debt-for-equity exchange should be treated as a taxable transaction to MetLife, Inc. Furthermore, as part of the IRS’s policy, the IRS did not determine whether the distribution or the debt-for-equity exchange satisfies certain conditions that are necessary to qualify for non-recognition treatment. Rather, the private letter ruling is based on representations by us and Brighthouse that these conditions have been satisfied. The tax opinion addressed the satisfaction of these conditions. The tax opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or a court may take a contrary position. In addition, the tax counsel relied on certain representations and covenants delivered by us and Brighthouse.\nIf the IRS ultimately determines that the distribution is taxable, the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to MetLife shareholders who received shares of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock in the distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and such shareholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. In addition, if the IRS ultimately determines that the distribution is taxable, we and Brighthouse could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, and either we or Brighthouse could have an indemnification obligation to the other, depending on the circumstances.\nEven if the spin-off distribution otherwise qualifies for non-recognition of gain or loss under Section 355 of the Code, it may be taxable to us, but not our shareholders, under Section 355(e) of the Code if 50% or more (by vote or value) of our common stock or Brighthouse Financial, Inc.’s common stock is acquired as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution. Under the tax separation agreement with Brighthouse, we are restricted from certain activities and have indemnity obligations which may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business, and might discourage or delay a strategic transaction that our shareholders may consider favorable.\n27\nCross-Border Trade and Investments\nOur U.K. business model utilizes certain rights to operate cross-border insurance and investment operations, which were eliminated as a result of the U.K. exiting the EU. In particular, our EEA insurance entities have lost the right to “passport” insurance services into the U.K. Nevertheless, MetLife expects to maintain its existing operating model, including as an inbound EEA-insurer under the U.K.’s TPR, which is due to last for at least three years and will permit MetLife to carry on its insurance business in the U.K. during that period. Operating expenses within our businesses could increase as a result of such changes.\nFurther, MetLife Investment Management Limited (“MIML”), our third-party investment manager in the U.K., has lost its passporting rights in the EU. We are arranging a means to continue our third-party investment management business in the EU.\nThe United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement came into effect in 2020. The U.S. and Chinese governments may continue to negotiate the terms of the bilateral economic relationship, including with respect to the imposition of tariffs.\nWhile tariffs do not generally affect us directly, the economic impact of continued uncertainty could impact the growth of the insurance market in China or other markets. A U.S. presidential executive order prohibited U.S. persons transacting in the publicly traded securities of (or derivatives or securities designed to provide investment exposure to) any Communist Chinese military companies, effective January 11, 2021. U.S. persons who held such investments as of that date (or do, whenever a company is later designated under the rule) may transact in such securities for the sole purpose of divesting them. The new U.S. presidential administration is reviewing the prior administration’s policies on China. As a result, it may delay, change, or withdraw all or part of these policies.\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), the U.K. regulator of LIBOR, previously indicated that it intends to stop persuading or compelling panel banks to submit quotes used to determine LIBOR after 2021. On November 30, 2020, the Intercontinental Exchange (“ICE”) Benchmark Administration (“IBA”), the administrator of LIBOR, announced a consultation regarding its intention to cease the publication of one week and two-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings at the end of December 2021, but to extend the publication of the remaining U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings (overnight and one, three, six and 12 month U.S. Dollar LIBOR) until the end of June 2023. The IBA intends to share the results of the consultation with the FCA and publish a summary of the responses. U.S. bank regulators acknowledged the announcement and, subject to certain limited exceptions, advised banks to cease writing new U.S. Dollar LIBOR contracts by the end of 2021.\nWe use LIBOR and other interbank offered rates as interest reference rates in many of our financial instruments. Existing contract fallback provisions, and whether, how, and when we and others develop and adopt alternative reference rates, will influence the effect of any changes to or discontinuation of LIBOR on us. We are identifying, assessing and monitoring market and regulatory developments, assessing agreement terms, and evaluating operational readiness. The SEC’s Division of Examinations (formerly Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations) expects to assess registrants’ efforts to prepare for LIBOR discontinuation and their transition to alternatives. We actively participate in the New York Federal Reserve Bank convened Alternative Reference Rate Committee and other industry association efforts on the transition to alternative reference rates. The Company is utilizing the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (“ISDA”) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol to address the transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to other risk-free rates in its OTC bilateral ISDA derivatives contracts. We also monitor the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s, International Accounting Standards Board’s, and U.S. Treasury Department’s updates on the accounting and tax implications of reference rate reform. We continue to assess current and alternative reference rates’ merits, limitations, risks and suitability for our investment and insurance processes.\n28\nCompetition\nThe life insurance industry remains highly competitive. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Competitive Pressures.” We face competition based on factors such as service, product features, scale, price, financial strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, e-business capabilities and name recognition. We compete globally with a large number of insurance companies and non-insurance financial services companies such as banks, broker-dealers and asset managers. We compete for individual consumers, employer and other group customers, as well as agents and other distributors of insurance and investment products. Some of our competitors offer a broader array of products, have more competitive pricing or, with respect to other insurance companies, have higher claims paying ability ratings. In the United States and Japan, we compete with a large number of domestic and foreign-owned life insurance companies, many of which offer products in categories on which we focus. Elsewhere, we compete with the foreign insurance operations of large U.S. insurers and with global insurance groups and local companies. Because we and others underwrite many group insurance products annually, our group purchasers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors rather than renewing coverage with us.\nInsurers are focused on their core businesses, specifically in markets where they can achieve scale. They are increasingly seeking alternative sources of revenue focusing on monetization of assets, and fee-based services. They are also looking for opportunities to offer comprehensive solutions which include value-added services along with traditional products\n.\nFinancial market volatility will impact insurers’ capital positions, which may strain the competitive environment and lead to industry consolidation. We believe adaptability to market changes (such as those from pandemics), as well as financial strength, technological efficiency and organizational agility, will most significantly differentiate competitors in our industry. We believe we are well positioned to succeed in any environment.\nThe Company distributes many of its products through a variety of third-party distribution channels, including banks and broker-dealers. We believe potential distribution partners carefully consider the financial strength of the company whose products they sell. Bank and broker-dealer consolidation could increase competition for access to distributors.\nWe face intense competition for employees. We must attract and retain highly skilled people with knowledge of our business and industry experience to support our business. We continue to seek to grow our career agency forces in selected global markets. We also continue efforts to enhance the efficiency and production of our sales representatives. These initiatives may not succeed in attracting and retaining productive agents. See “— Segments and Corporate & Other” for information on sales distribution.\nNumerous aspects of our business are heavily regulated. Legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment can affect our competitive position within the life insurance industry and within the broader financial services industry.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAt October 1, 2020, we had approximately 46,500 employees, calculated consistent with Regulation S-K Item 402(u) without exempting any employees under Regulation S-K Item 402(u)(4).\nWe strive to build a purpose-driven and inclusive culture where our employees are energized to make a difference. As a financial services company, we rely significantly on our global workforce, leveraging a wide variety of professional, scientific, management, business, and other skills and expertise, to create value for all of our stakeholders. To continue strengthening and cultivating a diverse workforce that can thrive now and, in the future, we will focus on the following:\n•\nPurpose, employee engagement and well-being:\nWe aspire to empower our employees to feel a sense of purpose, belonging and impact from their work contributions to execute our strategy, focus on our priorities, and achieve our goals. We will encourage our employees to prioritize health by connecting our purpose, our work, and the importance of overall health and well-being. We will also continue to apply these principles to strive to meet our employees’ needs during the COVID-19 Pandemic and beyond. We will monitor our progress in part by our annual employee survey, which measures purpose, engagement, and satisfaction.\n•\nDiversity, equity and inclusion:\nWe will cultivate an inclusive culture where our diversity of talent will position us to meet the needs of our customers, our shareholders, and the communities we serve around the world and to meet our people commitment. We will monitor our progress in part by measuring the representation across our workforce, including our leadership, against appropriate benchmarks. We will also monitor our progress by our annual employee survey and will review our practices and policies for equity and fairness.\n29\n•\nTalent development:\nWe will work to develop a highly skilled workforce of the future with the right capabilities to deliver on our strategic goals. Employees will leverage our digitally enabled learning platform to continuously learn and build core skills they need in a dynamic environment. Through holistic development and succession planning, we will continue to prepare our workforce for the future. We will also continue to cultivate an adaptable sales force, as customer relationships are crucial to our success. We will monitor our progress in part by engagement with our learning content and skills application, and through valuable insights from our annual employee survey.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nSet forth below is information regarding the executive officers of MetLife, Inc.

    "text": "Any or each of the events described below may (or may continue to) adversely affect the global economy, global financial markets, our reputation, our regulatory, customer, or other relationships, our results of operations, our liquidity or cash flows, our statutory capital position, our ability to meet our obligations, our credit and financial strength ratings, our financial condition, or the market price of our common stock. The effects may vary widely from time to time, product to product, market to market, region to region, or segment to segment.\nMany of these risks are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic conditions, and the occurrence of any of them may cause others to emerge or worsen. Such combinations could materially increase the severity of the cumulative or separate impact of these risks.\nThese risk factors are not a complete set of all potential risks that could affect MetLife. You should carefully consider the risk factors together with other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Business,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” and other reports and materials MetLife submits to the SEC.\nEconomic Environment and Capital Markets Risks\nWe May Face Difficult Economic Conditions\nMarket factors, including interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, derivative prices and availability, real estate conditions, foreign currency exchange rates, consumer and government spending, business investment, volatility, disruptions and strength of the capital markets, deflation and inflation, and government actions may result in investment losses, derivative losses, changes in insurance liabilities, impairments, increased valuation allowances, increases in reserves, reduced net investment income and changes in unrealized gain or loss positions.\nHigher unemployment, changes to inflation, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment, lower consumer spending, elevated incidence of claims, adverse utilization of benefits relative to our best estimate expectations, lapses or surrenders of policies, reduced demand for our products, and deferred or canceled payments of insurance premiums may negatively affect our earnings and capitalization.\nDeclining equity markets may decrease the account value of our products, reducing certain fees generated by these products, which may increase the level of insurance liabilities we carry, accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (“DAC”), and increase funding to our captive reinsurers. Additionally, lower interest rates may reduce returns in fixed income investments.\n31\nPublic Health Risks\nPandemics and other public health issues (such as the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic), and governmental, business, and consumer reactions to them, have affected and may continue to affect economic conditions. They have and may continue to cause illnesses and deaths, changes in consumer or business confidence and activity, changes to interest rates, and governmental or other restrictions on economic activity for prolonged periods. Any of these issues may cause or exacerbate any of the difficult economic conditions we describe in these risk factors.\nInterest Rate Risks\nSome of our products and investments expose us to interest rate risks, including changes in the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates, which may reduce or eliminate our investment spread and net income.\nLow interest rates and risk asset returns may reduce income from our investment portfolio, increase our liabilities for claims and future benefits, and increase the cost of risk transfer measures, decreasing our profit margins. During certain market events, such as a global credit crisis, a market downturn, or sustained low market returns, we may incur significant losses due to, among other reasons, losses incurred in our general account and the impact of guarantees, including increases in liabilities, capital maintenance obligations and collateral requirements. In addition, during periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to reinvest proceeds from certain investments at lower yields, reducing our investment spread. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities and loans in our investment portfolio with greater frequency. Although we may be able to lower interest crediting rates to help offset decreases in spreads, our ability to lower these rates is limited to our products that have adjustable interest crediting rates, which could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our investment spread may decrease or become negative.\nLower spreads may accelerate the amortization of DAC, reducing net income and in turn, harming our credit instrument covenants or rating agency assessment of our financial condition. During periods of declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be more attractive investments to consumers, resulting in increased premium payments on certain products, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency, while our new investments carry lower returns. A market interest rate decline could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. During periods of sustained lower interest rates, we may need to increase our reserves.\nInterest rate increases may also harm our profitability. During rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace the investments in our general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates required to stay competitive. This could result in a lower spread, lower profitability, decreased sales, and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns. This may result in cash outflows requiring the sale of investments on less favorable terms, resulting in investment losses. We may accelerate the amortization of DAC and value of business acquired (“VOBA”), reducing net income, harming our credit instrument covenants and rating agency assessment of our financial condition. Interest rate increases may harm the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair values of fixed income securities, and may increase our daily settlement payments on interest rate futures and cleared swaps, resulting in increased cash outflows and liquidity needs. Furthermore, if interest rates rise, our unrealized gains on fixed income securities may decrease and our unrealized losses may increase. We would recognize the accumulated change in estimated fair value of these fixed income securities in net income when we realize a gain or loss upon the sale of the security or we determine that the decline in estimated fair value is due to a credit loss. Finally, an increase in interest rates may decrease fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds.\nFederal Reserve Board monetary policy (and that of other central banks) may also impact the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments and may harm our investment income or product sales.\nThe measures we take to mitigate the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, such as mitigating our fixed income investments relative to our interest rate sensitive liabilities, may not be sufficient. For some of our liability portfolios, we may not be able to invest assets at the full liability duration, thereby creating some asset/liability mismatch. In addition, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting may cause material changes to our net income and stockholders’ equity because we record our non-qualified derivatives at fair value through earnings, while the related hedged items either follow an accrual-based accounting model or are recorded at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n32\nCredit Spread Risks\nChanges in credit spreads may result in market price volatility and cash flow variability. Market price volatility can make valuations of our securities difficult if trading becomes less frequent, which may require us to add to our reserves. Market volatility may cause changes in credit spreads, defaults and a lack of pricing transparency. An increase in credit spreads relative to U.S. Treasury benchmarks may increase our borrowing costs and decrease certain product fee income. A sustained decrease in credit spreads could reduce the yield on our future investments.\nEquity Risks\nDownturns and volatility in equity markets may harm our savings and investment products’ revenues and investment returns, where fee income is earned based upon the estimated fair value of our managed assets. Our variable annuity business is highly sensitive to equity markets, and a sustained weakness or stagnation in the equity markets may decrease these products’ revenues and earnings. Furthermore, certain of our variable annuity products offer guaranteed benefits that increase our potential benefit exposure should equity markets decline or stagnate.\nSustained declines in long-term equity returns or interest rates may harm the funding of our pension plans and other post-retirement benefit obligations. An increase in equity markets could increase settlement payments on equity futures and total rate of return swaps (“TRRs”), which may increase our cash outflows and liquidity needs.\nThe timing of distributions from and valuations of our investments in leveraged buy-out funds, hedge funds and other private equity funds depends on the performance of the underlying investments, distribution schedules, and the funds’ need for cash. The amount of net investment income from these investments can vary substantially from period to period and significant volatility may harm our returns and net investment income. In addition, downturns or volatility in the equity markets may decrease the estimated fair value of our alternative investments and equity securities.\nReal Estate Risks\nChanges in leasable commercial space supply and demand, pandemics and other public health issues (such as the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic), creditworthiness of tenants and partners, capital markets volatility, interest rate fluctuations, commodity prices, farm incomes, housing and commercial property market conditions, and real estate investment supply and demand may adversely impact our investments in commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loans, and real estate and real estate joint ventures.\nObligor and Counterparty Risks\nOur general account investments in certain countries could be adversely affected by volatility resulting from local economic and political concerns, as well as volatility in specific sectors. Government entities may face budget deficits and other financial difficulties, which may harm the value of securities we hold issued by or under the auspices of such governments.\nThe issuers or guarantors of fixed income securities and mortgage loans we own may default on principal and interest payments they owe us. Additionally, the change in value of underlying collateral within asset-backed securities (“ABS”), including mortgage-backed securities, may result in a default on principal and interest payments, reducing our cash flows. The occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit spreads, or other adverse events may reduce the estimated fair value of our portfolio of fixed income securities and mortgage loans and increase the default rate of the fixed income securities and mortgage loans in our investment portfolio.\nMany of our transactions with counterparties such as brokers and dealers, central clearinghouses, commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds, investment funds, reinsurers and other financial institutions expose us to the risk of counterparty default. Such credit risk may be exacerbated if we cannot realize on the collateral held by us in secured transactions or cannot liquidate such collateral at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. Furthermore, potential action by governments and regulatory bodies, such as controlling investment, nationalization, conservatorship, receivership and other intervention, or lack of action by governments and central banks, as well as deterioration in the banks’ credit standing, could negatively impact these instruments, securities, transactions and investments or limit our ability to trade with them. These may cause losses or impairments to the carrying value of our investments.\nOur efforts to manage our total exposure to a single counterparty or limited number of counterparties within or among any of our investment, derivative, treasury, and reinsurance relationships, which we adjust from time to time, may not completely or adequately mitigate counterparty risks.\n33\nCurrency Exchange Rate Risks\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, net income from non-U.S. operations and issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated instruments. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may also make certain of our products less attractive to customers, which may increase levels of early policy terminations and decrease sales volume and our in-force business. Such negative effects may be exacerbated if international markets experience severe economic or financial disruptions or significant currency devaluations, if a foreign economy is determined to be “highly inflationary,” or if a country withdraws from the Euro zone. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may harm our operations, earnings or investments in the affected countries.\nWe may be unable to mitigate the risk of such changes in exchange rates due to unhedged positions, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting resulting from derivative gains (losses) on non-qualifying hedges, the failure of hedges to effectively offset the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation, or other factors. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect the translation of results into our U.S. dollar basis consolidated financial statements.\nDerivatives Risks\nIf our counterparties, clearing brokers or central clearinghouses fail or refuse to honor their obligations under our derivatives, our risks may not be hedged. A counterparty, clearing broker, or central clearinghouse may become insolvent or otherwise unable or unwilling to make payments or to return collateral under the terms of derivatives agreements, increasing our costs. If the net estimated fair value of a derivative to which we are a party declines, we may need to pledge collateral or make payments. In addition, we may face increased costs to the extent we replace counterparties who suffer financial difficulties. Furthermore, our derivatives valuations may change based on changes to our valuation methodology or errors in such valuation or valuation methodology.\nTerrorism and Security Risks\nThe continued threat of terrorism, ongoing or potential military and other actions, and heightened security measures may cause significant volatility in global financial markets and result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity. The value of our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the credit and equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by such threats. Companies in which we maintain investments may suffer losses as a result of financial, commercial or economic disruptions, and such disruptions might affect the ability of those companies to pay interest or principal on their securities or mortgage loans. Terrorist or military actions also could disrupt our operations centers and result in higher than anticipated claims under our insurance policies.\nWe May Not Meet Our Liquidity Needs, Access Capital, or May Face Significantly Increased Cost of Capital Due to Adverse Capital and Credit Market Conditions\nIn cases of volatility, disruptions, or other conditions in global capital markets we may have to seek additional financing, the availability and cost of which could be adversely affected by market conditions, regulatory considerations, availability of credit to our industry generally, our credit ratings and credit capacity, reduced business activity, or investment losses, and the perception of our financial prospects. Our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. We may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing we need on favorable terms or at all. We may be required to return significant amounts of cash collateral on short notice under securities lending or derivatives agreements or post collateral or make payments related to specified counterparty agreements.\nOur business and financial results may suffer without sufficient liquidity through impaired ability to pay claims, other operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock, cash or collateral to our subsidiaries, maintain our securities lending, replace certain maturing liabilities, sustain our operations and investments, and repurchase our common stock. Capital and credit market volatility may limit our access to capital we need to operate, limiting our ability to raise capital, issue the types of securities we would prefer, timely replace maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory requirements, and access capital to grow our business, any of which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility.\nWe May Be Unable to Access Our Credit Facility, Reducing Our Liquidity and Leading to Downgrades in Our Credit and Financial Strength Ratings\nWe may fail to comply with or fulfill all conditions under the unsecured credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Funding, Inc. (“MetLife Funding”) maintain. Lenders may fail to fund their lending commitments under the Credit Facility due to insolvency, illiquidity or other reasons.\n34\nWe May Lose Business Due to a Downgrade or a Potential Downgrade in Our Financial Strength or Credit Ratings\nNationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (“NRSROs”) and others may, at any time, downgrade our financial strength ratings or credit ratings, lower our ratings outlooks, increase the scope or frequency of their reviews, or increase capital or other requirements to maintain ratings. Such changes could reduce our product sales, reduce cash flows from funding agreements and other capital market products, and force us to change product pricing and increase our financing costs, policy surrenders or withdrawals, collateral requirements, risk of derivative terminations, cost of reinsurance, regulatory scrutiny, or various other factors.\nWe May Not Find Available, Affordable or Adequate Reinsurance to Protect Us Against Losses\nReinsurers may increase our reinsurance costs, or may decline to offer us reinsurance, due to policy changes related to pandemics or other public health issues (such as the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic), market conditions, or other factors. Our risk of loss may increase if we decrease the amount of our reinsurance. Any of these could harm our ability to write future business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect to the policies we issue.\nWe may incur costs as a result of a reinsurer’s insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments, or inability or unwillingness to maintain collateral.\nOur Statutory Life Insurance Reserve Financings Costs May Increase, and We May Find Limited Market Capacity for New Financings\nIf MetLife’s ratings decline, market capacity is limited, or on other repricing occasions, our costs to finance statutory life insurance reserves may increase. If regulators disallow assets to back statutory reserves, we would not be able to take some or all related statutory reserve credit, which may harm the statutory capitalization of certain of our insurance subsidiaries.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nChanges in Laws or Regulation, or in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies, May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us\nInsurance or other regulators may change licensing, permit, or approval requirements, or take other actions harmful to us. They may also take actions that harm our customers and independent sales intermediaries or their operations, which may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or distribute our products.\nGovernments may change regulation of financial services, insurance, variable annuities and variable life insurance, securities, derivatives, pension, health care, accounting, cybersecurity, privacy and data protection, tort reform legislation, taxation, benefit plan investment advice and related fiduciary duties, antitrust as applied to the business of health insurance or otherwise, and other areas. Laws and regulations may also affect customers, sales intermediaries, or others. We or others may fail to comply with these requirements or suffer adverse regulatory examinations or audits. Regulators may also interpret rules differently from the way we have, or change interpretations of laws or rules, and legislators may change statutes. Any of these changes may harm our ability to continue to offer products we do today or to introduce new products.\nWe may incur costs to comply with laws and regulations and changes to these laws and regulations may increase our expenses. Our failure to comply with our own policies or with regulatory requirements may harm our reputation or result in sanctions or legal claims.\nLaws, regulations or regulatory actions may limit or change the type, amount or structure of compensation or benefits we offer our employees or others, which may harm our ability to compete in recruiting and retaining key personnel. We may also fail to fulfill our fiduciary or other benefit-related obligations completely.\nSolvency standards compliance may increase our capital and reserve requirements, risk management costs, and reporting costs. We may be subject to enhanced capital standards, supervision and additional requirements, such as group capital standards or insurer capital standards. MetLife, Inc. could be compelled to undergo FDIC liquidation if it becomes insolvent or is in danger of defaulting on its obligations, imposing greater losses on shareholders and unsecured creditors than under the Bankruptcy Code. This could also apply to financial institutions whose debt we hold and could harm the value of our holdings. We could be assessed charges in connection with a financial company liquidation.\n35\nOur ability to react to rapidly changing economic conditions and the dynamic, competitive markets may be impaired if our product designs do not allow frequent and contemporaneous revisions of key pricing elements, or if we are unable to work collaboratively with regulators. Changes in regulatory approval processes, rules and other dynamics in the regulatory process could harm our ability to react to such changing conditions. Rules on defined benefit pension plan funding may reduce the likelihood or delay corporate plan sponsors in terminating their plans or engaging in transactions to partially or fully transfer pension obligations. This could affect the mix of our pension risk transfers and increase non-guaranteed funding products.\nRegulators have reacted and may continue to react to pandemics and other public health issues (such as the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic). They may require “no lapse” in policy coverage regardless of whether we receive premiums or are able to assess fees against policyholder account balances. They may extend insurance coverage beyond our policy or contract terms and may impose premium grace periods, suspend cancellations, lower or freeze premium rates, and extend proof of loss deadlines, including retroactively, exposing us to risks and costs we are unable to foresee or underwrite. We may also adopt customer accommodations, such as waiving exclusions, forgoing rate increases or implementing lower rate increases than we would otherwise, relaxing claim documentation requirements, relaxing eligibility criteria, granting premium credits, or other accommodations for customers experiencing economic or other distress. Regulators may restrict our underwriting on public policy or other grounds, excluding factors such as exposure, quarantine, infection, and association with others suffering public health-related effects.\nOur New York regulator's annual SCL for year-end asset adequacy testing may impose unforeseen assumptions or requirements that require us to increase or release reserves, which could affect our statutory capital and surplus.\nGovernmental bodies may delay acting on or implementing regulatory or policy changes due to pandemics or other public health issues, or because they are attending to pandemic or public health issues rather than on other topics. This may increase uncertainty, prolong deleterious regulations and policies, delay or prevent beneficial regulatory or policy changes, and create the potential for later, more rapid changes to which we find it more difficult to adjust.\nGovernments or Others May Increase our Taxes by Changing or Re-Interpreting Tax Laws, Making Some of Our Products Less Attractive to Consumers\nChanges in tax laws or interpretations of such laws could increase our corporate taxes, reduce our earnings, and increase our deferred income tax liabilities. Changes may increase our effective tax rate or have implications that make our products less attractive to consumers. Tax authorities may enact laws, change regulations to increase existing taxes, or add new types of taxes, and authorities who have not imposed taxes in the past may impose taxes.\nCustomers shifting away from employee benefits, life insurance and annuity contracts, or other tax-preferred products would reduce our income from these products and our asset base, reducing our earnings and potentially affecting the value of our deferred tax assets.\nWe May Face Increasing Litigation and Regulatory Investigations\nLegal or regulatory actions, inquiries or investigations, whether ongoing or yet to come, could harm our reputation, ability to attract or retain customers or employees, business, financial condition, or results of operations, even if we ultimately prevail. Regulators or private parties may bring class actions, individual suits, or investigations seeking large recoveries alleging wrongs relating to sales or underwriting practices, claims payments and procedures, failure to adequately or appropriately supervise, inappropriate compensation contrary to licensing requirements, product design, disclosure, administration, investments, denial or delay of benefits, pandemic- or other public health-related practices (such as those related to the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic), data security incidents, discriminatory or inequitable practices, and breaches of fiduciary or other duties. We may be unable to anticipate the outcome of a litigation and the amount or range of loss because we do not know how adversaries, fact finders, courts, regulators, or others will evaluate evidence, the law, or accounting principles, and whether they will do so differently than we have.\n36\nWe May Face Changes to Interest Rates, the Value of our Financial Instruments, the Competitiveness of our Products, the Performance of our Investments, and our Relationships Due to LIBOR’s Termination and the Uncertainties in Our transition to Alternative Reference Rates\nRegulators, agencies, or benchmark administrators may change how LIBOR is determined, discontinue reliance on LIBOR as a benchmark rate as planned, or establish additional alternative reference rates. Any change or discontinuation of LIBOR (or other benchmark rates) may change interest rates and the value of, return on, and markets for, a broad array of our products, our financial instruments, the instruments in which we invest, or interest rates on our borrowing or debt. The effects on our business and investments will vary depending on existing fallback provisions in individual contracts and whether, how, and when industry participants continue to develop and adopt alternative reference rates and fallbacks for both legacy and new products or instruments. Uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR, regarding the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments, or regarding the application or effectiveness of alternative reference rates, could increase our costs, reduce the value of such instruments, or impair our cash or derivative positions. We may not effectively hedge or manage risks from differences among applicable fallback rates or when those rates take effect.\nWe may fail to adequately prepare for or react to LIBOR discontinuation and replacement, or fail to fully protect ourselves from all the effects of such changes. We may also fail to manage adequately any transition to alternative reference rates in a way that maintains the competitiveness of our products and the performance of our investment portfolio. Our transition may not effectively protect other aspects of our business, such as our operations and the accuracy of the financial models and valuations we use to gauge our risks, for financial reporting, or other purposes.\nAny such uncertainties or ineffective management may harm our reputation, our relationships with our investors, customers, or regulators, financial condition, and our business operations.\nOur Efforts to Meet Environmental, Social, and Governance Standards and to Enhance the Sustainability of our Businesses May Not Meet Investors' or Regulators' Expectations\nSome of our shareholders, investors and customers, or those considering such a relationship with us, evaluate our business or other practices according to a variety of environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) standards and expectations. Some of our regulators have proposed ESG rules or announced that they intend to review our practices against ESG standards; others may yet do so. Further, we define our own corporate purpose, in part, by the sustainability of our practices and our impact on all our stakeholders.\nOur investors or others may evaluate our practices by ESG criteria that are continually evolving and not always clear. These standards and expectations may also, as a whole, reflect contrasting or conflicting values or agendas. Our decisions or priorities must also necessarily, and simultaneously, take account of several business goals and interests. Our practices may also not change in the particulars or at the rate stakeholders expect. As a result, our efforts to conduct our business in accordance with some or all these expectations may involve trade-offs. We may fail to meet our commitments or targets, and our policies and processes to evaluate and manage ESG standards in coordination with other business priorities may not prove completely effective or satisfy investors, regulators, or others. We may face adverse regulatory, investor, media, or public scrutiny leading to business, reputational, or legal challenges.\nCapital Risks\nWe May not be Able to Pay Dividends or Repurchase Our Stock Due to Legal and Regulatory Restrictions or Cash Buffer Needs\nOur financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, capital position, liquidity, financial strength and credit ratings, as well as regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries, general market conditions, the market price of our common stock compared to management’s assessment of the stock’s underlying value, applicable regulatory approvals, other legal and accounting factors, and any other factors our Board deems relevant may preclude us from paying dividends or repurchasing our common stock.\nOther factors may affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock. Governments, investors or media may pressure us not to repurchase shares of our common stock or other securities, or prohibit us from doing so. Our use of other means to return excess capital to shareholders may be less tax-efficient than repurchases. We maintain a buffer of cash and other liquid assets, and may increase it. As a result, we may have less capital to devote to other uses, such as innovation, acquisitions, development and return of capital to shareholders. We may also be restricted from repurchasing shares or entering into share repurchase programs at times, such as when we are aware of material non-public information.\n37\nIf we do not pay dividends on our preferred stock or pay interest on our junior subordinated debentures or trust securities, terms of those instruments may restrict our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock. Further, terms applicable to our Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A (the “Series A preferred stock”), junior subordinated debentures and trust securities may prevent us from paying dividends or interest on those instruments. We may not be able to eliminate these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase of junior subordinated debentures or other securities.\nOur Subsidiaries May be Unable to Pay Dividends, a Major Component of Holding Company Free Cash Flow\nIf the cash MetLife, Inc. receives from its subsidiaries through dividends and other payments is insufficient for it to fund its debt service and other holding company obligations, MetLife, Inc. may have to issue debt or equity, or sell assets. MetLife, Inc. may also not meet our free cash flow or shareholder cash distribution goals.\nInsurance regulators may restrict dividends or other payments above certain amounts where their approval is required if they determine payments could be adverse to our policyholders or contract holders. Business conditions, rating agency considerations, taxation, dividend and repatriation rules, and monetary transfer and foreign currency exchange rules may limit our insurance subsidiaries’ dividends and other payments. We may need to transfer capital among our companies to comply with net worth maintenance or other support agreements, limiting capital available for other purposes.\nInvestment Risks\nWe May Face Defaults, Downgrades, Volatility or Other Events That Adversely Affect the Investments We Hold\nIn case of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit risk spreads, ratings downgrades or other events, our estimated fair value of our fixed income securities and loan portfolios and corresponding earnings may decline, and the default rate of our investment portfolio may increase. These changes could harm the issuers or guarantors of securities or the underlying collateral of structured securities that we hold. We may have to hold more capital to support our securities to maintain our RBC levels if securities we hold suffer a ratings downgrade. Our intent to sell, or our assessment of the likelihood that we will be required to sell, fixed income securities may increase our write-downs or impairments. Our realized losses or impairments on these securities may harm our net income.\nThe default rate, loss severity or other performance of our mortgage loan investments may change. Any concentration of our mortgage loans by geography, tenancy or property type may have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio, the prices we can obtain when we sell assets, and our results of operations or financial condition. Legislation or regulations that would allow or require modifications to the terms of, or impact the value of, mortgage loans could harm our investment portfolio.\nPandemics and other major public health issues (such as the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic) have affected and may continue to affect financial markets and our investment portfolio. These have increased and may continue to increase our risk of investment defaults, downgrades and volatility, and lower variable investment income and returns, and may cause or exacerbate any of the investment risks we describe in these risk factors.\nMarket volatility affects the value of or return on our investments. It may slow or prevent us from reacting to market events as effectively as we otherwise could. When we sell our investment holdings, we may not receive the prices we seek, and may sell at a price lower than our carrying value, due to reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption, or other reasons. Borrowers may delay or fail to pay principal and interest when due, or may demand loan modifications. Tenants may delay paying rent, or fail to pay it, or demand lease modifications. We may face moratoriums on foreclosures and other enforcement actions impairments, and loan or lease modifications, due to government action or market conditions. We may also encounter credit spreads changes, increasing our borrowing costs and decreasing our product fee income. Issuer or guarantor default rates may increase.\nWe May Have Difficulty Selling Holdings in Our Investment Portfolio or in Our Securities Lending Program in a Timely Manner to Realize Their Full Value\nWhen we sell holdings in our investment portfolio, we may not receive the price we seek and may sell at a price lower than our carrying value. We may face unfavorable conditions in privately-placed fixed income securities, private structured credit, certain derivative instruments, mortgage loans, policy loans, direct financing and leveraged leases, other limited partnership interests, tax credit and renewable energy partnerships, and real estate equity, including real estate joint ventures and funds. Our investments may suffer reduced liquidity during periods of market volatility or disruption or for other reasons. In addition, central banks' efforts to provide market liquidity or otherwise address market conditions may not be successful or sufficient. We may realize losses that harm our financial metrics, which could harm our compliance with our credit instruments and rating agency capital adequacy measures.\n38\nWe may face similar risks if we are required under our securities lending program to return significant amounts of cash collateral that we have invested. Our securities lending activities and profitability may decrease.\nWe May Have to Pledge Collateral or Make Payments in Derivatives Transactions\nWe may have to pledge additional collateral and increase payments we make under our derivatives transactions. Regulators, clearinghouses, or counterparties may restrict or eliminate eligible collateral, increase our collateral requirements, or charge us to pledge such collateral, which would increase our costs, reduce our investment income, and harm our liquidity.\nWe May Change Our Securities and Investments Valuation, or Take Allowances and Impairments on Our Investments, or Change Our Methodologies, Estimations, and Assumptions\nDuring periods of market disruption or rapidly changing market conditions, such as significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, or infrequent trading, or when market data is limited, our assets may become less liquid. We may base our asset valuations on less observable and more subjective judgments, assumptions, or methods that may result in estimated fair values that significantly vary by period, and may exceed the investment’s sale price. The estimated fair value of our securities may also decrease due to changes in valuation methods and assumptions.\nBusiness Risks\nOur Actual Claims or Other Results May Differ From Our Estimates, Assumptions, or Models\nIf our actual claims experience is less favorable than the underlying underwriting, reserving, and other assumptions we used in establishing claim liabilities, we could be required to reduce DAC or VOBA, increase our liabilities, or incur higher costs.\nThe amounts that we will ultimately pay to settle our liabilities, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future, may vary from what we expect. We may change our liability assumptions and increase our liabilities based on actual experience and accounting requirements. Our operating practices and procedures that support our policyholders and contractholder obligation assumptions, such as obtaining, accumulating, and filtering data, and our use of technology, such as database analysis and electronic communications, may affect our reserve estimates. If these practices and procedures do not accurately produce the data to support our assumptions or cause us to change our assumptions, or if enhanced technological tools become available to us, we may change those assumptions and procedures, as well as our reserves. If any of our operating practices and procedures do not accurately produce, or reproduce, data that we use to conduct any or all aspects of our business, such deviations or errors may negatively impact our business, reputation, results of operations, or financial condition. We may change our assumptions, models, or reserves due to changes in longevity. Increases in the prevalence and accuracy of genetic testing, or restrictions on its use, may exacerbate adverse selection risks.\nPandemics and other public health issues (such as the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic) have caused and may continue to cause increased claims under many of our policies (for example, life, disability, leave, long-term care, and supplemental health products), raising our resulting costs. Governments or others may fail to produce accurate population and impact data that we use in our estimates, assumptions, models, or reserves, such as death rates, infections, morbidity, hospitalization, or illness. This may cause or exacerbate any of the risks related to our estimates or assumptions. Pandemics and other public health issues may cause related or consequential long-term economic, social, political, policy, regulatory, business, demographic, or other changes to our claims or other areas subject to estimates, assumptions, models, or reserves. We may not accurately predict, prepare, and adjust to these changes.\nWe May Face a Variety of Political, Legal, Operational, Economic and Other Risks Globally\nThe global nature of our business operations exposes us to a wide range of political, legal, operational, economic and other risks, including but not limited to: nationalization or expropriation of assets; imposition of limits on foreign ownership of local companies; changes in laws, their application or interpretation; political instability; economic or trade sanctions; sanctions on cross-border exchange listing, investment or other securities transactions; dividend limitations; price controls; currency exchange controls or other transfer or exchange restrictions; difficulty enforcing contracts; regulatory restrictions; and public or political criticism of our business and operations. Some of these actions may affect us more harshly than our peers. Some of our businesses operate in emerging markets, where many of these risks are heightened.\nWe face other risks that may affect our global operations and investments, including those related to international trade agreements, uncertainties in intergovernmental organizations, pension system reforms, labor problems with workers’ associations or trade unions.\n39\nExpanding our operations to new businesses or jurisdictions may require considerable management time and expenses before significant, if any, revenues and earnings are generated, which may reduce management and financial resources available for other uses. Our operations in new or existing markets may be unprofitable or achieve low margins.\nWe May Face Competition for Business\nCompetitive pressures, based on a number of factors including service, product features, scale, price, financial strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, e-business capabilities, name recognition, performance against ESG metrics, technology, adaptation in light of pandemics and other public health issues (such as the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic), and other factors, may adversely affect the persistency of our products and our ability to sell products in the future. We may be harmed by competition from other insurance companies, as well as non-insurance financial services companies, which may have a broader array of products, more competitive pricing, higher claims paying ability ratings, greater financial resources with which to compete, or pre-existing customer bases for financial services products. Additionally, we may lose purchasers of group insurance products that are underwritten annually due to more favorable terms from competitors. Furthermore, the investment management and securities brokerage businesses have relatively low barriers to entry and continually attract new entrants. Our customers and clients may engage other financial service providers, resulting in our loss of business.\nAn increase in consolidation activity among banks and broker-dealers may negatively impact the insurance industry’s sales. It may increase competition for access to distributors, resulting in greater distribution expenses, and may impair our ability to market insurance products to or expand our current customer base. Consolidation and other industry changes may also increase the likelihood that distributors will renegotiate agreements on terms less favorable to us.\nIn addition, legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment for our business may not impact all activities and companies equally, which could adversely affect our competitive position within the insurance industry and the broader financial services industry.\nWe May Face Technological Changes That Present New and Intensified Challenges\nTechnological changes may present us with new or intensified challenges. We may be unable to accurately, timely, or completely process the increased volume and variety of information relating to our businesses, including information related to deaths, that new technological tools for data collection and analysis make available. We may modify our assumptions, models, or reserves as a result of our review of such information. Changes in collection and analysis of data could expose us to regulatory or legal actions.\nTechnological changes may change how we interact with existing or prospective customers, who may expect increased choices, and we may have to redesign our products as a result. Our distribution channels may become more automated to increase flexibility of access to our services and products. We may incur significant costs to implement these changes. If we are unsuccessful, our competitive position and distribution relationships may be harmed.\nTechnological advances may also change our investments composition and results. For example, changes in energy technology and increasing consumer preferences for e-commerce may harm the profitability of some businesses. We may fail to adjust our investments accordingly or suffer stranded assets.\nWe May Face Catastrophes That Affect Liabilities for Policyholder Claims and Reinsurance Availability\nCatastrophic events could increase claims, impair assets in or otherwise harm our investment portfolio, and could harm our reinsurers’ financial condition, increasing reinsurance defaults. Catastrophic events may also reduce economic activity in affected areas, which could harm our existing business or prospects for new business, or the value of our investments. The severity of claims from catastrophic events may be higher if property values increase due to inflation or other factors or our insured lives or property are geographically concentrated.\nPandemics and other public health issues (such as the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic) or other events may continue to cause a large number of illnesses or deaths. Hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather, fires and man-made events such as riot, insurrection, or terrorist attacks may also cause catastrophic losses. An event that affects the workforce of one or more of our customers could increase our mortality or morbidity claims. Governmental and non-governmental organizations may not effectively mitigate catastrophes' effects.\nConsistent with industry practice and accounting standards, we establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only after assessing the probable losses arising from the event. The liabilities we have established may not be adequate to cover our actual claim liabilities. Our efforts to manage risks may be impeded by restrictions on our ability to withdraw from catastrophe-prone areas or on internal reinsurance transactions. We may be unable to obtain catastrophe reinsurance at rates we find acceptable, or at all. We may also be called upon to make contributions to guaranty associations or similar organizations as a result of catastrophes.\n40\nWe May Face Direct or Indirect Effects of Climate Change or Responses to It\nClimate change may increase the frequency and severity of near- or long-term weather-related disasters. public health incidents, and pandemics, and their affects may increase over time. Climate change regulation may harm the value of investments we hold or harm our counterparties, including reinsurers. Our regulators may also increasingly focus their examinations on climate-related risks.\nWe May Need to Fund Deficiencies in Our Closed Block, and May Not Re-Allocate Closed Block Assets\nThe closed block assets established in connection with the MLIC demutualization, their cash flows, and the revenue from the closed block policies may not be sufficient to provide for the policies’ guaranteed benefits. If they are not, we must fund the shortfall. We may choose, for competitive or other reasons, to support policyholder dividend payments with our general account funds. Such actions may reduce funds otherwise available for other uses.\nWe May Be Required to Recognize an Impairment of Our Goodwill or Other Long-Lived Assets or to Establish a Valuation Allowance Against Our Deferred Income Tax Assets\nWe may reduce our estimated fair value of business units, impairing our goodwill and charging net income, if prolonged market declines or other factors negatively impact the performance of our businesses.\nWe may write down long-lived assets if we conclude we will be unable to recover their carrying amount.\nWe may charge net income because we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not realize a deferred income tax asset based on the performance of the business and its ability to generate future taxable income. In addition, we may need to write off deferred tax assets if tax rates change.\nWe May Be Required to Accelerate the Amortization of or Impair DAC, DSI, VOBA or VOCRA\nAdverse changes to investment returns, mortality, morbidity, persistency, interest crediting rates, dividends paid to policyholders, expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties, significant or sustained equity market declines, significantly lower spreads, and certain other economic variables, such as inflation, may harm the gross profit or margins that we use to amortize DAC, deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) and VOBA. These factors could cause an impairment of the value of customer relationship assets (“VOCRA”) acquired. We may accelerate amortization in the period these occur.\nWe May Face Volatility, Higher Risk Management Costs, and Increased Counterparty Risk Due to Guarantees Within Certain of Our Products\nOur liabilities for guaranteed benefits, including but not limited to no-lapse guarantee benefits, guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDBs”), guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWBs”), guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMABs”), guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIBs”), and minimum crediting rate features could increase if equity or fixed income funds decline or become more volatile, or interest rates remain low or decrease.\nOur derivatives and other risk management strategies to hedge our economic exposure to these liabilities may harm our results. Our use of reinsurance, derivatives, or other risk management techniques may not sufficiently offset the costs of guarantees or protect us against losses from changes in policyholder behavior, mortality, or market events.\nPolicyholders may also change their behavior in unexpected ways. For example, policyholders and contractholders seeking liquidity due to economic uncertainty or challenges may withdraw or surrender, change their premium payment practices, exercise product options, or take other actions at rates different from those than we expect.\nOperational Risks\nOur Risk Management Policies and Procedures, or Our Models, May Leave Us Exposed to Unidentified or Unanticipated Risk\nOur enterprise risk management and business continuity policies and procedures may not be sufficiently comprehensive and may not identify or adequately protect us from every risk to which we are exposed.\n41\nPandemics and other public health issues (such as the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic) have caused and may continue to cause extended remote work periods and other unusual conditions. These may strain our risk management and our business continuity plans, introduce or increase our operational and cybersecurity risks, and otherwise impair our ability to manage our business. They may increase the frequency and sophistication of attempts at unauthorized access to our technology systems. They may hinder our efforts to prevent money-laundering or other fraud, whether due to limited abilities to “know our customers,” strains on our programs to avoid and deter foreign corrupt practices, or otherwise, and may both increase our compliance costs and our risk of violations.\nThe assumptions, projections and data on which our risk management models are based may be inaccurate, and our models may not be suitable for their purpose, be misused, not operate properly, and contain errors. Our decisions and model adjustments, including determination of reserves, are based on such model output and reports and may be flawed. We may fail to identify or remediate model errors adequately. Our models may not fully predict future exposures or correctly reflect past experience.\nOur evaluation of markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. We may not effectively identify and monitor all risks or appropriately limit our exposures and our associates, vendors or non-employee sales agents may not follow our risk management policies and procedures. Past or future misconduct by our associates, vendors or non-employee sales agents could result in investigations, violations of law, regulatory sanctions, and litigation. We may have to implement more extensive or different risk management policies and procedures due to legal and regulatory requirements.\nOur Policies and Procedures May Be Insufficient to Protect Us From Operational Risks\nWe may make errors in any of the large number of transactions we process through our complex administrative systems. Our controls and procedures to prevent such errors may not be effective. Our controls and procedures to comply with and enforce contractual obligations may not always be effective. Mistakes can subject us to claims from our customers.\nIf we are unable to obtain necessary and accurate information from our customers or their employees, we may be unable to provide or verify coverage and pay claims, or we may pay claims without sufficient documentation.\nPandemics and other public health issues (such as the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic) have increased, and may continue to increase, our administrative expenses and the reliability and efficacy of our processes. They may affect our employees, agents, brokers and distribution partners, vendors, other service providers and counterparties. We may have difficulties conducting our business, including continued challenges in selling some of our products, such as those traditionally sold in person. We may find it difficult or impossible to obtain required or appropriate signatures from our representatives, customers, or others for a variety of purposes, including property title-related or other governmental filings, increasing the uncertainties and risks from a variety of transactions, such as product sales, regulatory matters, or real estate-related transactions. We may face increased workplace safety costs and risks, lose access to critical employees, and face increased employment-related claims and employee-relations challenges. Any of the third parties to whom we outsource certain critical business activities may fail to perform due to a force majeure or otherwise.\nThe controls of our vendors on whom we rely may not meet our standards or be adequate. Our vendors could fail to perform their services accurately or timely. Our exchange of information with vendors may be imperfect, or our vendors may suffer financial or reputational distress. Each of these may cause errors, misconduct, or discontinuation of services.\nWe may fail to escheat property timely and completely. As a result, we may incur charges, reserve strengthening, and expenses, regulatory examinations, or penalties.\nOur practices and procedures may, at times, limit our efforts to contact all our customers, which may result in delayed, untimely, or missed customer payments.\nOur associates, vendors, non-employee sales agents, customers, or others may commit fraud against us. Our policies and procedures may be ineffective in preventing, detecting or mitigating fraud and other illegal or improper acts.\nWe may fail to attract, motivate and retain employees, develop talent, and plan for management succession.\nWe may identify internal control deficiencies, disclosure control deficiencies, or material weaknesses. Pandemics and other public health issues (such as the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic) may affect our internal controls or disclosure controls by imposing new, less-seasoned processes, procedures, and controls to respond to changes in our business environment. If any employees who are key to our controls become ill or are unable to work effectively, this may also affect our internal or disclosure controls.\n42\nWe May Fail to Protect Confidential Information Due to a Failure in Our Cybersecurity or Other Information Security Systems or Our Disaster Recovery Plans or Those of Our Vendors\nWe and our vendors may suffer computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized or fraudulent access, human errors, cyber-attacks or other penetrations of our computer systems. Our efforts to reduce the risk of cyber-incidents and protect our information technology may be insufficient to prevent break-ins, attacks, fraud, security breaches or other unauthorized access to our and our vendors’ systems. We may not timely detect such incidents.\nWe or our vendors may fail to maintain adequate internal controls, fail to comply with relevant policies and procedures, or policies, procedures and controls may not be sufficient. As a result, we may intentionally or unintentionally disclose or misuse confidential personal information, or others may misappropriate it.\nWe, our vendors, and our customers may suffer disasters such as a natural catastrophe, epidemic, pandemic, industrial accident, blackout, computer virus, terrorist attack, cyber-attack or war, and our disaster recovery systems may be insufficient, particularly if these affect computer-based data processing, transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy valuable data. Our ability to conduct business effectively and maintain the security, integrity, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data could be severely compromised if key personnel are unavailable, our vendors’ ability to provide goods and services, and our associates’ ability to perform their job responsibilities, are impaired by a disaster. Any insurance for liability, operational and other risks may be insufficient to protect us against such losses or may become less readily available or more expensive.\nWe may not be able to reliably access all the documents and records in the information storage systems we use, whether electronic or physical. We may fail to obtain or maintain all the records we need to administer and establish appropriate reserves for benefits and claims accurately and timely. If a breach released any of our sensitive financial information, then customers, investors, or regulators may develop an inaccurate perception of our financial condition or results of operations. We could be compelled to publicly disclose information prematurely in order to dispel such inaccurate perceptions, or in order to fulfill our disclosure obligations, even if we do not believe the information is yet completely reliable or confirmed per our usual internal controls and disclosure controls.\nRegulators’ or others’ scrutiny of cybersecurity, including new laws or regulations, could increase our compliance costs. Regulators, customers, or others may act against us for any cybersecurity failures. Our continuous technological evaluations and enhancements, including changes designed to update our protective measures, may increase our risk of a breach or gap in our security. We may incur higher costs to comply with laws on, or regulators’ scrutiny of, our use, collection, management, or transfer of data and other privacy practices.\nWe May Face Changes in Accounting Standards\nAuthorities may change accounting standards that apply to us, and we may adopt changes earlier than required. We may not be able to predict or assess the effects of these changes.\nOur Associates May Take Excessive Risks\nOur associates, including executives and others who manage sales, investments, products, wholesaling, underwriting, and others, may take excessive risks. Our compensation programs and practices, and our other controls, may not effectively deter excessive risk-taking or misconduct.\nWe May Have Difficulty in or Complications from Marketing and Distributing Our Products\nOur product distributors may suspend, alter, reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us if we change our strategy, if our business performance declines, as a result of rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks, or for other reasons. Our distributors may merge, change their business models in ways that affect us, or terminate their distribution contracts with us, and new distribution channels could emerge, harming our distribution efforts. Distributors may try to renegotiate the terms of any existing selling agreements to less favorable terms due to consolidation or other industry changes or for other reasons. Disruption or changes to our relationships with our distributors could harm our ability to market our products.\nOur employees or unaffiliated firms or agents may distribute our products in an inappropriate manner, or our customers may not understand them or whether they are suitable.\nWe May Change Our Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans Assumptions\nWe may change our discount rate, rate of return on plan assets, mortality rate, compensation level or medical inflation assumptions, harming our benefit plan estimates.\n43\nWe May be Unable to Protect Our Intellectual Property and May Face Infringement Claims\nWe may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing on or misappropriating our intellectual property. We may incur litigation costs to enforce and protect it or to determine its scope or validity, and we may not be successful.\nIn addition, we may be subject to claims by third parties for infringement of intellectual property, breach of license usage rights, or misappropriation of trade secrets. We may incur significant expenses for any such claims. If we are found to have infringed or misappropriated a third-party intellectual property right, we may be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or from utilizing and benefiting from certain intellectual property. Alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties or implement a costly alternative.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions, Dispositions or Other Structural Changes\nWe May Face Difficulties, Unforeseen Liabilities, Asset Impairments or Rating Actions from Business Acquisitions or Integrating and Managing Growth of Such Businesses, Dispositions of Businesses, or Legal Entity Reorganizations\nAcquisitions and dispositions of businesses, joint ventures, and other structural changes expose us to a number of risks arising from, among other factors, economic, operational, strategic, financial, tax, legal, regulatory, and compliance. As a result, there can be no assurance that any acquisition, disposition or reorganization will be completed as contemplated, or at all. We may not realize the anticipated economic, strategic or other benefits of any transaction. Effecting these transactions may result in unforeseen expenditures and liabilities or a performance different than we expected. The areas where we face risks include, among others, rights to indemnification for losses, regulatory, liquidity and capital requirements, loss of customers, distributors, vendors and key personnel, diversion of management time and resources to acquisition integration challenges or growth strategies from maximizing business value, and inability to realize anticipated efficiencies. Our success in conducting business through joint ventures will depend on our ability to manage a variety of issues, including: (i) our exposure to additional operational, financial, legal or compliance risks as a result of entry into certain joint ventures; (ii) our dependence on a joint venture counterparty given limits on our ownership or distribution requirements, as well as for resources, including capital and product distribution, may reduce our control over, financial returns from, or the value of a joint venture; and (iii) our counterparties' cooperation or their ability to meet obligations, or election to alter, modify or terminate a relationship.\nReorganizing or consolidating the legal entities through which we conduct business may raise similar risks. Our success in realizing the benefits from legal entity reorganizations will also depend on our management of various issues, including regulatory approvals, modification of our operations and changes to our investment portfolios or derivatives hedging activities.\nAny of these risks, if realized, could prevent us from achieving the benefits we expect from such transactions.\nWe May Face Risks Related to Our Separation from and Continuing Relationship with Brighthouse\nWe may not realize any or all the expected tax or other benefits of the Brighthouse separation. Brighthouse may not succeed, causing litigation or regulatory claims against us.\nGovernance Risks\nMetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors May Influence the Outcome of Stockholder Votes on Matters Due to the Voting Provisions of the MetLife Policyholder Trust\nOur Board of Directors may be able to influence stockholder votes by virtue of the provisions of the MetLife Policyholder Trust and the number of shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock held by it. Trust beneficiary vote instructions are likely to have disproportionate weight on votes concerning certain fundamental corporate actions because the trustee will vote all the shares of common stock held by the trust in proportion to those instructions actually received.\nWe may incur regulatory, mailing, or other costs related to the termination of the trust, distribution of the common stock held in trust to beneficiaries and the resulting increase in the number of shareholders. The increase to our shareholder base with full voting rights may affect the outcome of matters brought to a stockholder vote and other aspects of our corporate governance.\nState or Federal Laws, or MetLife, Inc.’s Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, May Delay, Deter or Prevent Takeovers and Business Combinations\nState laws, federal laws and MetLife, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider favorable. These provisions may adversely affect the price of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock if they discourage takeover attempts.\n44\nStockholders’ changes to MetLife, Inc.’s corporate governance may make it more difficult for the Board of Directors to protect stockholders’ interests."

MetLife is organized into five segments: U.S.; Asia; Latin America; EMEA; and MetLife Holdings. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results of operations in Corporate & Other. See “Business — Segments and Corporate & Other” and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the Company’s segments and Corporate & Other.\nSee “— Consolidated Company Outlook” for a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Company.\nCurrent Year Highlights\nDuring 2020, adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, net of foreign currency fluctuations, increased compared to 2019 in many of our segments, and most significantly in our U.S. segment, despite the negative impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic and related restrictions. Positive net flows drove an increase in our investment portfolio; however, investment yields declined. Expenses, including interest credited expenses, also declined. Underwriting experience was favorable compared to 2019, and reflected impacts from the COVID-19 Pandemic and related restrictions. In addition, our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a charge that was higher than the 2019 charge. A favorable change in net derivative gains (losses) over 2019 was primarily the result of a decline in long-term interest rates.\n50\nThe following represents segment level results and percentage contributions to total segment level adjusted earnings available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n_______________\n(1) Excludes Corporate & Other adjusted loss available to common shareholders of $749 million.\n(2) Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is our GAAP measure of segment performance.

The COVID-19 Pandemic continues to impact the global economy and financial markets and has caused volatility in the global equity, credit and real estate markets. Governments and businesses have taken numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, social distancing, shelter in place or total lock down orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. Some governments and businesses have begun to ease some restrictions. Others have reinstated restrictions they previously lifted. Nevertheless, these measures have disrupted and will continue to disrupt business activity and have resulted in an economic slowdown and volatility in the financial markets, to which governments and central banks around the world have responded with unprecedented fiscal and monetary policies. Although vaccines have become available, distribution and access are expected to take time before a significant percentage of the population is vaccinated. See\n“— Industry Trends — Financial and Economic Environment.”\nIn addition, a prolonged low or near zero interest rate environment remains possible. The econom\nic projections of the Federal Reserve Board suggest that the current low interest rate environment will continue until 2023, and potentially longer. We believe that our investment portfolio is highly diversified and well positioned to withstand economic downturns; however, we expect that the market-related effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic, as well as the sustained low interest rate environment, will continue to have an impact across our investment portfolio. See\n“— Industry Trends — Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment”\nfor discussion of the mitigating actions the Company has taken to reduce interest rate sensitivity as market interest rates are a key driver of our results.\nEvents related to the COVID-19 Pandemic may continue to adversely affect certain of our business operations, investment portfolio, derivatives, financial results or financial condition. S\nee “Risk Factors.”\nWe have implemented risk management and business continuity plans and taken preventive measures and other precautions, such as employee business travel restrictions and remote work arrangements which, to date, have enabled us to maintain our critical business processes, customer service levels, relationships with key vendors, financial reporting systems, internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.\nWe granted and continue to grant certain accommodations to our customers, borrowers and lessees, including (i) waiving exclusions, such as deferred rate increases, extending premium grace periods, waiving late payment fees, and relaxing claim documentation requirements, (ii) credits on auto and insured dental premiums, (iii) payment deferrals and other loan modifications on certain commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loans, and (iv) certain operating and direct financing lease concessions. See\nNote 8\nof the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding COVID-19 Pandemic-related mortgage loan and lease concessions.\nSee also, “— Results of Operations — Segment Results and Corporate & Other — U.S.”\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $4.5 billion of cash and liquid assets at the holding companies which is above the high end of our $3.0 billion to $4.0 billion holding company cash target. In 2021, we expect to maintain this holding company cash target and expect to be within or above the high end of this range.\nOur capital stress testing and longstanding commitment to liquidity position us to withstand the current crisis. We have, and may continue to maintain, a higher than normal level of short-term liquidity, which may adversely affect net investment income if the reinvestment process occurs over an extended period of time. We do not expect any material liquidity deficiencies, and we expect to remain able to comply with the financial covenants of our credit agreements. See\n“— Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nWe will continue reviewing accounting estimates, asset valuations and various financial scenarios for capital and liquidity implications. See “\n— Investments — Current Environment”\nand\n“Risk Factors”\nfor additional information.\nAssuming (i) interest rates following the observable forward yield curves as of December 31, 2020, including a 10-year U.S. Treasury rate of 0.91% at December 31, 2020, and 1.12% at December 31, 2021, and (ii) a mid-single digit S&P 500 equity index increase for the full year 2021, we expect the average annual ratio of free cash flow to adjusted earnings over the two-year period of 2020 and 2021 to be 65% to 75%. In addition, we remain on track to generate approximately $20.0 billion of free cash flow over the time period of 2020 through 2024.\n53\nWe continue to target an adjusted return on equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) other than foreign currency translation adjustments (“FCTA”) of 12% to 14% over the near-term assuming non-recessionary market conditions. However, (i) given the possible effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other events, (ii) given our exclusion of MetLife P&C from adjusted earnings because we expect to close its disposition in the second quarter 2021, and (iii) assuming (a) interest rates follow the observable forward yield curves as of December 31, 2020, including our updated assumptions for the 10-year U.S. Treasury rates noted in the paragraph above, (b) a mid-single digit S&P 500 equity index increase for the full year 2021, and (c) positive low double digit private equity returns in 2021, we could be below the low end of the target range in 2021.\nWe are fully committed to achieving a direct expense ratio, excluding total notable items related to direct expenses and pension risk transfers below 12.3%. We expect pressure on this ratio in 2021 due to the pending disposition of MetLife P&C with its lower direct expense ratio, but we intend to continue to exercise expense discipline and be below 12.3% for 2022.\nFurthermore, we also remain fully committed to our Next Horizon Strategy, which was introduced at our December 2019 Investor Day.\nOur outlook relies on the accuracy of our assumptions about future economic and business conditions, which can be affected by known and unknown risks and other uncertainties, such as those posed by the COVID-19 Pandemic. Due to the evolving and highly uncertain nature of the COVID-19 Pandemic and other factors, we will continually review our assumptions, implementing mitigation plans, and taking precautions. We may revise our outlook as we obtain more information regarding the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the effect and efficacy of efforts taken to respond to it, economic conditions, regulatory changes, and other events, and the impact of these events on our business operations, investment portfolio, derivatives, financial results and financial condition.\nIndustry Trends\nWe continue to be impacted by the changing global financial and economic environment that has been affecting the industry.\nFinancial and Economic Environment\nOur business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors. See “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — We May Face Difficult Economic Conditions.”\nWe have market presence in numerous countries and, therefore, our business operations are exposed to risks posed by local and regional economic conditions. See “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — We May Face Difficult Economic Conditions — Currency Exchange Rate Risks.”\nWe are closely monitoring political and economic conditions that might contribute to global market volatility and impact our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives. For example, certain measures taken by governments and businesses as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic to respond to the spread of the virus have disrupted business activity and have resulted in an economic slowdown and volatility in financial markets. Governmental and non-governmental organizations may not effectively respond to the spread and severity of the COVID-19 Pandemic, increasing the magnitude and longevity of the potential negative economic impacts. We cannot yet determine or estimate the actions that will be taken, including governmental laws, regulations or orders, and the extent to which these actions have affected or will affect our business operations, investment portfolio, financial results, or financial condition. See “— Executive Summary — Consolidated Company Outlook” and “— Investments — Current Environment.”\nWe are also monitoring the imposition of tariffs or other barriers to international trade, changes to international trade agreements, and their potential impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including the impact of the trade agreement reached by the U.K. and the EU in December 2020. See “Business — Regulation — Cross-Border Trade and Investments.” See also “Risk Factors — Business Risks — We May Face a Variety of Political, Legal, Operational, Economic and Other Risks Globally.”\n54\nGovernments and central banks around the world are responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic with unprecedented fiscal and monetary policies, which are expected to have significant and ongoing effects on financial markets and the global economy. In the United States, the Federal Reserve Board continues to expand its balance sheet and board members’ forecasts suggest the policy rate is likely to remain near zero through 2023. Separately, another COVID-related stimulus package has been passed. The European Central Bank has significantly increased the size of its asset purchase program, and extended its commitment to undertake purchases through 2021, reduced constraints on what and how much it can purchase, and launched new funding facilities for euro area banks, while the Bank of England significantly lowered interest rates and relaunched quantitative easing. Additionally, a number of European countries, including the U.K., have implemented large fiscal stimulus programs, as well as the provision of guarantees and loans for private sector companies. The EU approved a stimulus package comprised of grants and low interest financing to member states, which is expected to become operational in 2021.\nIn Japan, the Bank of Japan has accelerated its purchases of interests in index-linked securities and real estate investments, increased the annual limit on purchases of commercial paper and bonds, and introduced new measures to facilitate corporate financing, including a new lending program for businesses impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic. In addition, the Japanese government approved additional stimulus measures, including provisions for cash payouts to individuals and business owners, tax reform, and zero-interest loans.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the actions that will be taken, effect of these actions or the impact on our business operations, investment portfolio, financial results, or financial condition. See “— Investments — Current Environment.”\nImpact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment\nMarket interest rates are a key driver of our results. Sustained periods of low U.S. interest rates may cause us to:\n•\nReduce the difference between interest credited to policyholders and interest earned on supporting assets (“gross margin”);\n•\nReinvest investment proceeds in lower yielding assets and experience higher frequency prepayment or redemption of assets in our portfolio;\n•\nIncrease our reserves or trigger loss recognition events related to policy liabilities, accelerate amortization of DAC and VOBA, and potentially impair intangible assets;\n•\nReduce interest expense, change pension and other post-retirement benefit calculations, and change derivative cash flows and market values;\n•\nChange our product offerings, design features, crediting rates and sales mix; and\n•\nExperience changing policyholder behavior, including surrender or withdrawal activity.\nFor additional discussion on gross margin and interest rate assumptions, as well as the potential impact of low interest rates, see “— Results of Operations — Consolidated Results — Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2019 — Actuarial Assumption Review and Certain Other Insurance Adjustments.” See also “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — We May Face Difficult Economic Conditions — Interest Rate Risks;” “Risk Factors — Business Risks — We May Be Required to Accelerate the Amortization of or Impair DAC, DSI, VOBA or VOCRA;” “Risk Factors — Business Risks — We May Be Required to Recognize an Impairment of Our Goodwill or Other Long-Lived Assets or to Establish a Valuation Allowance Against Our Deferred Income Tax Assets;” and “Risk Factors — Business Risks — We May Face Volatility, Higher Risk Management Costs, and Increased Counterparty Risk Due to Guarantees Within Certain of Our Products.”\nMitigating Actions\nTo mitigate unfavorable impacts of a low U.S. interest rate environment, we maintain diversification across products, distribution channels, and geographies while proactively evaluating interest rate and product strategies. In addition, we apply disciplined asset/liability management (“ALM”) strategies, including the use of derivatives, and may take management actions such as:\n•\nLowering interest crediting rates or adjusting the dividend scale on products;\n•\nLimiting or closing certain products to new sales to manage exposures; and\n•\nShifting sales focus to less interest rate sensitive products.\n55\nOur ability to take such actions may be limited by competition, regulatory approval requirements, or minimum crediting rate guarantees and may not match the timing or magnitude of interest rate changes.\nIn addition to proactive mitigation strategies, businesses within our Latin America, EMEA, and Asia (exclusive of our Japan business) segments help mitigate unfavorable impacts to our consolidated results given their limited U.S. interest rate sensitivity.\nFor additional discussion on interest rate risk management and our ability to change interest crediting rates or dividend scales, see “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — We May Face Difficult Economic Conditions — Interest Rate Risks;” “— Policyholder Liabilities;” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Management of Market Risk Exposures.”\nLow Interest Rate Scenarios\nTo illustrate our sensitivity to low U.S. interest rates, we compared the outcome of two hypothetical low interest rate environments (the “Flat Interest Rate Scenario” and “Declining Interest Rate Scenario”) relative to our baseline economic assumptions (the “Base Scenario”) through 2023. The impact of these scenarios are evaluated for certain of our segments, as well as Corporate & Other.\nThe Flat Interest Rate Scenario assumes U.S. interest rates for all maturities remain at their December 31, 2020 levels and are unchanged through 2023. The Declining Interest Rate Scenario assumes (i) short-term U.S. interest rates remain through 2023 at their December 31, 2020 levels; and (ii) long-term U.S. interest rates decline immediately on January 1, 2021 with the 10-year interest rate remaining unchanged thereafter and interest rates beyond 10-years gradually falling through 2023. Other than changing U.S. interest rates through 2023, all other economic assumptions are equivalent in the Base Scenario, Flat Interest Rate Scenario and Declining Interest Rate Scenario.\nThe following table compares the most relevant interest rate assumptions for the dates indicated:\nHypothetical Impact to Net Derivative Gains (Losses) and Adjusted Earnings\nWe estimate a net favorable impact to net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives through 2023 in both hypothetical low interest rate scenarios. We hold significant positions in long-duration receive-fixed U.S. interest rate swaps, which are most sensitive to the 10-year and 30-year swap rates, to hedge reinvestment risk. For purposes of the two hypothetical low interest rate scenarios, we have excluded all VA program derivatives. For information regarding our VA and non-VA program derivatives, see “— Results of Operations — Consolidated Results.”\nWe estimate a net unfavorable impact to consolidated adjusted earnings through 2023 in both hypothetical low interest rate scenarios. The negative impact of reinvesting cash flows in lower yielding assets is partially offset by lowering interest crediting rates and dividend scales on products, and additional derivative income. This negative impact is more severe in the Declining Interest Rate Scenario given that reinvestment of cash flows would be at much lower rates relative to the Flat Interest Rate Scenario.\n56\nThe following table summarizes the hypothetical impact on net derivative gains (losses) and adjusted earnings for certain of our segments, as well as Corporate & Other, for the Flat Interest Rate Scenario:\nThe following table summarizes the hypothetical impact on net derivative gains (losses) and adjusted earnings for certain of our segments, as well as Corporate & Other, for the Declining Interest Rate Scenario:\nSegments and Corporate & Other\nThe primary drivers impacting certain of our segments, as well as Corporate & Other, in the hypothetical low interest rate scenarios are summarized below. MetLife P&C is excluded due to the pending disposition. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Our Latin America, EMEA, and Asia (exclusive of our Japan business) segments are excluded given their limited U.S. interest rate sensitivity. For additional information regarding account values subject to minimum crediting rate guarantees, the maturity profile of fixed maturity securities available-for-sale (“AFS”), and the yield on invested assets, see “— Investments;” “— Policyholder Liabilities — Policyholder Account Balances;” and Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n57\nU.S.\nGroup Benefits\nOur group life insurance products are primarily renewable term policies. This provides repricing flexibility to mitigate the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets.\nOur retained asset accounts experience gross margin compression due to minimum crediting rate guarantees. All of these accounts are at their minimum crediting rates. Additionally, we experience gross margin compression from our disability policy claim reserves for which crediting rates cannot be reduced. We use interest rate derivatives to mitigate gross margin compression for both products.\nGross margin compression is limited for our group disability products, which are generally renewable term policies allowing for crediting rate adjustments at renewal based on the retrospective experience rating and the prevailing interest rate assumptions.\nRetirement and Income Solutions\nThis business contains both short- and long-duration products consisting of capital market products, pension risk transfers, structured settlements, and other benefit funding products. Based on our investment portfolios and expected cash flows, only a small portion of invested assets are subject to reinvestment risk through 2023.\nA significant portion of short-duration products are managed on a floating rate basis, which mitigates gross margin compression. The two hypothetical low interest rate scenarios do not assume any additional ALM actions we may take in our capital markets business.\nOur long-duration products have very predictable cash flows and we use both interest rate derivatives and asset/liability duration matching to mitigate gross margin compression. These mitigating strategies partially offset the negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets.\nAsia\nOur Japan business offers traditional life insurance and accident & health products, many of which are U.S. dollar denominated. We experience gross margin compression to the extent our investment portfolios are U.S. interest rate sensitive and we are unable to offset the impact by lowering interest crediting rates. Additionally, we manage interest rate risk on our life products through a combination of product design features and ALM strategies.\nOur Japan business also offers U.S. dollar denominated annuities which are predominantly single premium products with crediting rates set upon issuance. This allows for tightly managing product ALM, cash flows and net spreads, which mitigates interest rate risk.\nMetLife Holdings\nOur interest rate sensitive life products include traditional and universal life products. Since most of our traditional life insurance is participating, we can mitigate gross margin compression by adjusting the applicable dividend scale. For our universal life products, we manage interest rate risk through a combination of product design features and ALM strategies, including the use of interest rate derivatives. Although we are able to mitigate gross margin compression by lowering interest crediting rates on certain in-force universal life policies, these actions may be partially offset by increased liabilities for policies with secondary guarantees.\nOur annuity products experience gross margin compression primarily from deferred annuities with minimum crediting rate guarantees. Most of these contracts are at their minimum crediting rate, and, therefore we use interest rate derivatives to partially mitigate gross margin compression.\nOur long-term care business experiences gross margin compression as we cannot reduce interest crediting rates for established claim reserves. Long-term care policies are guaranteed renewable, and rates may be adjusted on a class basis with regulatory approval to reflect emerging experience. We review the discount rate assumptions and other assumptions associated with our long-term care claim reserves no less frequently than annually and, with respect to interest rates, set the discount rate based on the prevailing interest rate environment.\nOur retained asset accounts experience gross margin compression due to minimum crediting rate guarantees. Most of these accounts are at their minimum crediting rates and therefore we use interest rate derivatives to mitigate gross margin compression.\n58\nBased on our investment portfolios and cash flow estimates, approximate\nly 6%\nof our invested assets each year are subject to reinvestment risk through 2023.\nCorporate & Other\nCorporate & Other contains the surplus investment portfolios used to fund capital and liquidity needs, certain reinsurance agreements, collateral financing arrangements, and our outstanding debt and preferred securities. For purposes of the two hypothetical low interest rate scenarios, the preferred stock dividend impact is excluded and the impact on pension and postretirement plan expenses is included within Corporate & Other and not allocated across segments. The negative impact of reinvesting in lower yielding assets is more than offset by the positive impact of lower interest expense on debt and lower pension expense.\nAlthough low interest rates result in pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities increasing, the impact is more than offset by the corresponding returns on fixed income investments and results in lower expenses.\nCompetitive Pressures\nThe life insurance industry remains highly competitive. See “Business — Competition.” Product development is focused on differentiation leading to more intense competition with respect to product features and services. Certain of the industry’s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition. Cost reduction efforts are a priority for industry players, with benefits resulting in price adjustments to favor customers and reinvestment capacity. Larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity, product development, technology optimization, risk management, and innovation, which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry. Insurers are focused on their core businesses, specifically in markets where they can achieve scale. Insurers are increasingly seeking alternative sources of revenue; there is a focus on monetization of assets, fee-based services, and opportunities to offer comprehensive solutions, which include providing value-added services along with traditional products. Financial strength and flexibility and technology modernization are prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. Larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in analytics, distribution, and information technology and have the ability to leverage the capabilities of new digital entrants. There is a shift in distribution from proprietary to third party models in mature markets, due to the lower cost structure. Evolving customer expectations are having a significant impact on the competitive environment as insurers strive to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base. Legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment can also affect the competitive environment within the life insurance industry and within the broader financial services industry. See “Business — Regulation.” We believe that the current low interest rate environment and increased volatility of the financial markets, as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, will continue to strain the life insurance industry, as well as the broader financial services industry. In addition to financial strength, technological efficiency and organizational agility, we believe that the ability to adapt to changes in the competitive environment as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic is a significant differentiator to success in the life insurance industry and the broader financial services industry, and we are well positioned to compete in this environment.\nRegulatory Developments\nIn the United States, our life insurance companies are regulated primarily at the state level, with some products and services also subject to federal regulation. As life insurers introduce new and often more complex products, regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry. Regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact the statutory reserve and capital requirements of the industry. See “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Changes in Laws or Regulation, or in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies, May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us.” Regulators have also undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several markets or products, including equity-indexed annuities, variable annuities and group products and, in some states, instituted a moratorium on new reserve financing transactions. See “Business — Regulation,” “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — Our Statutory Life Insurance Reserve Financings Costs May Increase, and We May Find Limited Market Capacity for New Financings,” “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Changes in Laws or Regulation, or in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies, May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us” and “— Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Capital — Affiliated Captive Reinsurance Transactions.”\n59\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining:\nIn addition, the application of acquisition accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed — the most significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical accounting estimates. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nLiability for Future Policy Benefits\nGenerally, future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present value of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations, investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business basis. If experience is less favorable than assumed, additional liabilities may be established, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and interest.\nLiabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation.\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance, recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. Liabilities for ULSG and paid-up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index, such as the S&P 500 Index.\nWe regularly review our estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits and compare them with our actual experience. Differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and guarantees, as well as in the establishment of the related liabilities, result in variances in profit and could result in losses.\n60\nSee Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our liability for future policy benefits.\nReinsurance\nAccounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks. We periodically review actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluate the financial strength of counterparties to our reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in our security impairment process. See “— Investment Allowance for Credit Loss and Impairments.” Additionally, for each of our reinsurance agreements, we determine whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. We review all contractual features, including those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims. If we determine that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting.\nSee Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our reinsurance programs.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired\nWe incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that relate directly to the successful acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts are capitalized as DAC. In addition to commissions, certain direct-response advertising expenses and other direct costs, deferrable costs include the portion of an employee’s total compensation and benefits related to time spent selling, underwriting or processing the issuance of new and renewal insurance business only with respect to actual policies acquired or renewed. We utilize various techniques to estimate the portion of an employee’s time spent on qualifying acquisition activities that result in actual sales, including surveys, interviews, representative time studies and other methods. These estimates include assumptions that are reviewed and updated on a periodic basis to reflect significant changes in processes or distribution methods.\nVOBA represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance, annuity, and investment-type contracts in force at the acquisition date. For certain acquired blocks of business, the estimated fair value of the in-force contract obligations exceeded the book value of assumed in-force insurance policy liabilities, resulting in negative VOBA, which is presented separately from VOBA as an additional insurance liability included in other policy-related balances. The estimated fair value of the acquired obligations is based on projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.\nSeparate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting period, which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of DAC and VOBA. Our practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected. We monitor these events and only change the assumption when our long-term expectation changes. The effect of an increase (decrease) by 100 basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease (increase) in the DAC and VOBA amortization with an offset to our unearned revenue liability which nets to approximately $30 million. We use a mean reversion approach to separate account returns where the mean reversion period is five years with a long-term separate account return after the five-year reversion period is over. The current long-term rate of return assumption for the variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts is 6.0%.\nWe periodically review long-term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits. These assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business. Assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed are updated annually. If the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease.\n61\nOur most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of DAC and VOBA are due to revisions to expected future investment returns, expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on participating traditional life contracts, variable and universal life contracts and annuity contracts. We expect these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future. Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and we are unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, DAC and VOBA for the Company was $16.4 billion and $17.8 billion, respectively. The following illustrates the effect on DAC and VOBA of changing each of the respective assumptions, as well as updating estimated gross margins or profits with actual gross margins or profits during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Increases (decreases) in DAC and VOBA balances, as presented below, resulted in a corresponding decrease (increase) in amortization.\nItems contributing to the changes to DAC and VOBA amortization in 2020 consisted of the following:\n•\nNet increase in amortization of $285 million mostly due to the annual actuarial assumption review relating to the general account long-term investment rates of return.\nItems contributing to the changes to DAC and VOBA amortization in 2019 consisted of the following:\n•\nNet increase in amortization of $106 million associated with net investment/net derivative gains (losses) and GMIB, primarily driven by the following:\n◦\nAn increase in amortization of $25 million from net derivative gains from freestanding derivatives hedging the variable annuity guarantees, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of approximately $10 million from net derivative losses resulting from the increases in variable annuity guarantee obligations.\n◦\nA decrease in amortization of approximately $10 million associated with gains from GMIB hedges and the decreases in GMIB obligations.\n◦\nNet increase in amortization of approximately $100 million from other investment activities.\n•\nNet increase in general account investment return mostly due to net investment income assumption unlocking and an update to the yield curve for market value adjustment.\nOur DAC and VOBA balance is also impacted by unrealized investment gains (losses) and the amount of amortization which would have been recognized if such gains and losses had been realized. The increase in unrealized investment gains (losses) decreased the DAC and VOBA balance by $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Notes 5 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the DAC and VOBA offset to unrealized investment gains (losses).\nEstimated Fair Value of Investments\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our investments, fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical investments in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. When such unadjusted quoted prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar but not identical investments, or other observable inputs. If these inputs are not available, or observable inputs are not determinable, unobservable inputs and/or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management judgment are used to determine the estimated fair value of investments.\nThe methodologies, assumptions and inputs utilized are described in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n62\nFinancial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Our ability to sell investments, or the price ultimately realized for investments, depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain investments.\nInvestment Allowance for Credit Loss and Impairments\nThe significant estimates related to our evaluation of credit loss and impairments on our investment portfolio are summarized below. In addition, information about the evaluation processes and measurement methodologies and changes thereto from the implementation of new credit loss guidance on January 1, 2020, is contained in Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFixed Maturity Securities\nThe assessment of whether a credit loss has occurred is based on our case-by-case evaluation of whether the net amount expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis. We consider a wide range of factors about the security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. In accordance with new credit loss guidance adopted January 1, 2020, we evaluate credit loss by considering information about past events, current and forecasted economic conditions, and we measure credit loss by estimating recovery value using a discounted cash flow analysis. In accordance with this new credit loss guidance, we record an ACL for the amount of the credit loss instead of recording a reduction of the amortized cost as an impairment. We revise these evaluations as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nPrior to adopting the new credit loss guidance, we used the incurred loss model.\nThe credit loss evaluation process and the measurement of credit loss are generally similar\nunder the new credit loss guidance and the incurred loss model.\nMortgage Loans\nThe ACL is established both for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics and for loans with dissimilar risk characteristics, collateral dependent loans and reasonably expected troubled debt restructurings, individually on a loan specific basis. We record an allowance for expected lifetime credit loss in an amount that represents the portion of the amortized cost basis of mortgage loans that we do not expect to collect, resulting in mortgage loans being presented at the net amount expected to be collected. In accordance with new credit loss guidance adopted January 1, 2020, to determine the mortgage loan ACL, we estimate expected lifetime credit loss over the contractual term of our mortgage loans adjusted for expected prepayments and any extensions; and we consider past events and current and forecasted economic conditions. Our estimates are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nPrior to adopting the new credit loss guidance, we used the incurred loss model. The credit loss evaluation process and the measurement of credit loss are generally similar under the new credit loss guidance and the incurred loss model, except that the new credit loss guidance requires recording an ACL for expected lifetime credit loss.\nReal Estate, Leases and Other Asset Classes\nThe determination of the amount of ACL and impairments on real estate, leases and the remaining invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon our quarterly evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nDerivatives\nThe determination of the estimated fair value of freestanding derivatives, when quoted market values are not available, is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads, default risk, nonperformance risk, volatility, liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on significant inputs into the OTC derivative pricing models and credit risk adjustment.\n63\nWe issue variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits, some of which are embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity product, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). The estimated fair values of these embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions, including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk-free rates. The valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for our nonperformance risk and risk margins for non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance risk adjustment, which is captured as a spread over the risk-free rate in determining the discount rate to discount the cash flows of the liability, is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for MetLife, Inc.’s debt, including related credit default swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to MetLife, Inc. Risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties in certain actuarial assumptions. The establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees.\nThe table below illustrates the impact that a range of reasonably likely variances in credit spreads would have on our consolidated balance sheet, excluding the effect of income tax, related to the embedded derivative valuation on certain variable annuity products measured at estimated fair value. In determining the ranges, we have considered current market conditions, as well as the market level of spreads that can reasonably be anticipated over the near term. The ranges do not reflect extreme market conditions such as those experienced during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, as we do not consider those to be reasonably likely events in the near future.\nThe impact of the range of reasonably likely variances in credit spreads decreased as compared to prior periods. However, these estimated effects do not take into account potential changes in other variables, such as equity price levels and market volatility, which can also contribute significantly to changes in carrying values. Therefore, the table does not necessarily reflect the ultimate impact on the consolidated financial statements under the credit spread variance scenarios presented below.\nThe accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of accounting standards continue to evolve in practice. If it is determined that hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially affected. Assessments of the effectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income.\nVariable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our nonperformance risk, variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income. If interpretations change, there is a risk that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation and reporting at estimated fair value on the consolidated financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair value could materially affect net income.\n64\nAdditionally, we ceded the risk associated with certain of the variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits described in the preceding paragraphs. The value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by us with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer. Because certain of the direct guarantees do not meet the definition of an embedded derivative and, thus are not accounted for at fair value, significant fluctuations in net income may occur since the change in fair value of the embedded derivative on the ceded risk is being recorded in net income without a corresponding and offsetting change in fair value of the direct guarantee.\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our derivatives and hedging programs.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances that management deems a triggering event indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test. Examples of such events or circumstances are changes in business climate, including disruptions in global capital markets. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted a new accounting pronouncement related to simplifying the test for goodwill impairment, as described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, the Company will consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying value of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value of the reporting units include projected adjusted earnings, current book value, the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business, long-term growth rates, comparative market multiples, the account value of in-force business, projections of new and renewed business, as well as margins on such business, interest rate levels, credit spreads, equity market levels, and the discount rate that we believe is appropriate for the respective reporting unit.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment tests on all of its reporting units using quantitative assessments under the market multiple, embedded value and discounted cash flow valuation approaches based on best available data as of June 30, 2020. The Company concluded that the estimated fair values of all its reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired.\nWe apply significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units. The valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectation regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood differ in some respects from actual future results. Declines in the estimated fair value of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position.\nSee Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our goodwill.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nCertain subsidiaries of MetLife, Inc. sponsor defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans covering eligible employees. See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on amendments to our U.S. benefit plans. The calculation of the obligations and expenses associated with these plans requires an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases and healthcare cost trend rates, as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirement, withdrawal rates and mortality. In consultation with external actuarial firms, we determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical experience of the plan and its assets, currently available market and industry data, and expected benefit payout streams.\n65\nWe determine the expected rate of return on plan assets based upon an approach that considers inflation, real return, term premium, credit spreads, equity risk premium and capital appreciation, as well as expenses, expected asset manager performance, asset weights and the effect of rebalancing. Given the amount of plan assets as of December 31, 2019, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic benefit costs would have been a decrease of $114 million and an increase of $114 million, respectively, in 2020. This considers only changes in our assumed long-term rate of return given the level and mix of invested assets at the beginning of the year, without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long-term rate of return.\nWe determine the discount rates used to value the Company’s pension and postretirement obligations, based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds. Given our pension and postretirement obligations as of December 31, 2019, the beginning of the measurement year, if we had assumed a discount rate for both our pension and postretirement benefit plans that was 100 basis points higher or 100 basis points lower than the rates we assumed, the change in our net periodic benefit costs would have been a decrease of $93 million and an increase of $88 million, respectively, in 2020. This considers only changes in our assumed discount rates without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed discount rate. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to, among other factors, changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics. These differences may have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and liquidity.\nSee Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of assumptions used in measuring liabilities relating to our employee benefit plans.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Our accounting for income taxes represents our best estimate of various events and transactions. Tax laws are often complex and may be subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of inherently complex tax laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nIn establishing a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, assumptions may be made in determining whether, and to what extent, a tax position may be sustained. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when events occur requiring a change.\nValuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets when management determines, based on available information, that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances. See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to our determination of such valuation allowances.\nWe may be required to change our provision for income taxes when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances. Additionally, future events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur.\nSee also Notes 1 and 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our income taxes.\n66\nLitigation Contingencies\nWe are a defendant in a large number of litigation matters and are involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities related to certain lawsuits, including our asbestos-related liability, are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of reliable data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates. On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation, regulatory investigations and litigation-related contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. It is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of our litigation and regulatory investigations, including asbestos-related cases, or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nSee Note 21\nof the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our assessment of litigation contingencies.\nEconomic Capital\nEconomic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in our business. Our economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. Economic capital-based risk estimation is an evolving science and industry best practices have emerged and continue to evolve. Areas of evolving industry best practices include stochastic liability valuation techniques, alternative methodologies for the calculation of diversification benefits, and the quantification of appropriate shock levels. MetLife’s management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards. For further information, see “Financial Measures and Segment Accounting Policies” in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nAcquisitions\nAcquisition of Versant Health\nFor information regarding the Company's acquisition of Versant Health, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAcquisition of PetFirst\nIn January 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of PetFirst Healthcare, LLC (“PetFirst”), a fast-growing pet health insurance administrator.\nAcquisition of Willing\nIn November 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Bequest, Inc. (“Willing”), a leading digital estate planning service. This transaction brings new digital capabilities to the Company and reinforces its commitment to providing simple and easy-to-use benefits that respond to consumer needs.\nDispositions\nPending Disposition of MetLife P&C\nFor information regarding the Company's pending disposition of MetLife P&C, reported as held-for-sale, see Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDisposition of MetLife Russia\nFor information regarding the Company's disposition of MetLife Russia, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n67\nDisposition of MetLife Seguros de Retiro\nFor information regarding the Company's disposition of MetLife Seguros de Retiro, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDisposition of MetLife Hong Kong\nFor information regarding the Company’s disposition of MetLife Hong Kong, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n68\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nDuring 2020, net income (loss) decreased $491 million from 2019, primarily driven by unfavorable changes in net investment gains (losses) and adjusted earnings, as well as the impact of our actuarial assumption review, largely offset by a favorable change in net derivative gains (losses), net of investment hedge adjustments.\nManagement of Investment Portfolio and Hedging Market Risks with Derivatives.\nWe manage our investment portfolio using disciplined ALM principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities. Our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount, while optimizing risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return. Our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, with over 80% of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities AFS and mortgage loans. These securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities. In addition, our general account investment portfolio includes, within contractholder-directed equity securities and fair value option securities (“FVO Securities”) (collectively, “Unit-linked and FVO Securities”), contractholder-directed equity securities supporting unit-linked variable annuity type liabilities (“Unit-linked investments”), which do not qualify as separate account assets. Returns on these Unit-linked investments, which can vary significantly from period to period, include changes in estimated fair value subsequent to purchase, inure to contractholders and are offset in earnings by a corresponding change in policyholder account balances through interest credited to policyholder account balances.\n69\nWe purchase investments to support our insurance liabilities and not to generate net investment gains and losses. However, net investment gains and losses are incurred and can change significantly from period to period due to changes in external influences, including changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity markets; counterparty specific factors such as financial performance, credit rating and collateral valuation; and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing. Changes in these factors from period to period can significantly impact the levels of provision for credit loss and impairments on our investment portfolio, as well as realized gains and losses on investments sold.\nWe also use derivatives as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio and insurance liabilities to hedge certain risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity market levels. We use freestanding interest rate, equity, credit and currency derivatives to hedge certain invested assets and insurance liabilities. A portion of these hedges are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, which reduce volatility in earnings. For those hedges not designated as accounting hedges, changes in market factors lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains (losses) generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged, which creates volatility in earnings. We actively evaluate market risk hedging needs and strategies to ensure our free cash flow and capital objectives are met under a range of market conditions.\nCertain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). We use freestanding derivatives to hedge the market risks inherent in these variable annuity guarantees. We continuously review and refine our strategy and ongoing refinement of the strategy may be required to take advantage of the NAIC rules related to a statutory accounting election for derivatives that mitigate interest rate sensitivity related to variable annuity guarantees. Our macro hedge program, included in the non-VA program derivatives section of the table below, protects our overall statutory capital from significant adverse economic conditions. The valuation of these embedded derivatives includes a nonperformance risk adjustment, which is unhedged, and can be a significant driver of net derivative gains (losses) and volatility in earnings, but does not have an economic impact on us.\nNet Derivative Gains (Losses)\n. The variable annuity embedded derivatives and associated freestanding derivative hedges are collectively referred to as “VA program derivatives.” All other derivatives that are economic hedges of certain invested assets and insurance liabilities are referred to as “non-VA program derivatives.” The table below presents the impact on net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives and VA program derivatives:\n70\nThe favorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on non-VA program derivatives was $537 million ($424 million, net of income tax). This was primarily due to the impact of certain derivative transactions after long-term rates declined during 2020, favorably impacting interest rate options and receive-fixed interest rate swaps acquired primarily as part of our macro hedge program. These favorable impacts were partially offset by key equity index increases in 2020 unfavorably impacting equity TRRs acquired in 2020 primarily as part of our macro hedge program. Also, certain credit spreads widened in 2020 and narrowed in 2019, unfavorably impacting written credit default swaps used in replications. Because certain of these hedging strategies are not designated or do not qualify as accounting hedges, the changes in the estimated fair value of these freestanding derivatives are recognized in net derivative gains (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the items being hedged.\nThe favorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on VA program derivatives was $184 million ($145 million, net of income tax). This was due to a favorable change of $106 million ($84 million, net of income tax) in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives and a favorable change of $142 million ($112 million, net of income tax) in other risks in embedded derivatives. These favorable changes were partially offset by an unfavorable change of $64 million ($51 million, net of income tax) in market risks in embedded derivatives net of freestanding derivatives hedging market risks in embedded derivatives. Other risks relate primarily to the impact of policyholder behavior and other non-market risks that generally cannot be hedged.\nThe aforementioned $106 million ($84 million, net of income tax) favorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives resulted from a favorable change of $58 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread and a favorable change of $48 million, before income tax, related to model changes and changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on variable annuity guarantees.\nThe aforementioned $142 million ($112 million, net of income tax) favorable change in other risks in embedded derivatives reflects actuarial assumption updates and a combination of factors, which include fees deducted from accounts, changes in the benefit base, premiums, lapses, withdrawals and deaths, in addition to changes in cross-effect, basis mismatch, risk margin and fund allocation.\nThe aforementioned $64 million ($51 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change reflects a $712 million ($563 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change in market risks in embedded derivatives, partially offset by a $648 million ($512 million, net of income tax) favorable change in freestanding derivatives hedging market risks in embedded derivatives.\nThe primary change in market factors affecting VA program derivatives is summarized as follows:\n•\nKey equity index levels either increased less or decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, contributing to an unfavorable change in our embedded derivatives and a favorable change in our freestanding derivatives. For example, the S&P 500 equity index increased 16% in 2020 and increased 29% in 2019.\nWhen equity index levels decrease in isolation, the variable annuity guarantees become more valuable to policyholders, which results in an increase in the undiscounted embedded derivative liability. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk.\nWhen the risk-free interest rate decreases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a higher valuation of the liability than if the risk-free interest rate had remained constant. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free interest rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk.\nWhen our own credit spread increases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a lower valuation of the liability than if our own credit spread had remained constant. As a result, a gain is created from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk. For each of these primary market drivers, the opposite effect occurs when the driver moves in the opposite direction.\nNet Investment Gains (Losses)\n. The unfavorable change in net investment gains (losses) of $554 million ($438 million, net of income tax) primarily reflects 2019 gains on sales of real estate joint ventures, mark-to-market losses in 2020 on equity securities, which are measured at estimated fair value through net income (loss), higher provisions for credit loss on mortgage loans in 2020, losses incurred in connection with the dispositions of MetLife Seguros de Retiro and MetLife Russia and a 2019 gain on a renewable energy partnership. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by higher foreign currency transaction gains in 2020, a 2020 recovery on a leveraged lease that was previously impaired, a 2019 tax credit partnership impairment and a loss in 2019 as a result of the disposition of MetLife Hong Kong.\n71\nDivested Businesses.\nIncome (loss) before provision for income tax related to the divested businesses, excluding net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), increased $74 million ($61 million, net of income tax) to a loss of $30 million ($23 million, net of income tax) in 2020 from a loss of $104 million ($84 million, net of income tax) in 2019. Included in this increase was a decrease in total revenues of $22 million, before income tax, and a decrease in total expenses of $96 million, before income tax. Divested businesses primarily include activity related to the separation of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries, as well as the dispositions of MetLife Hong Kong and MetLife Seguros de Retiro.\nTaxes.\nOur 2020 effective tax rate on income (loss) before provision for income tax was 22%. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax charges from foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate and the dispositions of MetLife Seguros de Retiro and MetLife Russia, partially offset by tax benefits related to non-taxable investment income, tax credits, the finalization of bankruptcy proceedings for a leveraged lease investment and the impact from an IRS audit matter. Our 2019 effective tax rate on income (loss) before provision for income tax was 13%. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits related to non-taxable investment income, tax credits, tax benefits related to the resolution of an uncertainty regarding the deemed repatriation transition tax enacted as a part of U.S. Tax Reform and the settlement of certain tax audits, partially offset by tax charges from foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate and the disposition of MetLife Hong Kong.\nActuarial Assumption Review and Certain Other Insurance Adjustments.\nResults for 2020 include a $378 million ($301 million, net of income tax) charge associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions related to reserves and DAC, of which a $44 million gain ($34 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses).\nOf the $378 million charge, $120 million ($94 million, net of income tax) was related to DAC and $258 million ($207 million, net of income tax) was associated with reserves. The portion of the $378 million charge that is included in adjusted earnings is $255 million ($203 million, net of income tax).\nThe $44 million gain ($34 million, net of income tax) recognized in net derivative gains (losses) associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions is included within the other risks in embedded derivatives line in the table above.\nAs a result of our annual review of actuarial assumptions, changes were made to economic, biometric, policyholder behavior, and operational assumptions. The most significant impacts were in the MetLife Holdings segment, driven by economic assumption updates, including changes to interest rate projections. The breakdown of total 2020 results is summarized as follows:\n•\nEconomic assumption updates resulted in unfavorable impacts to reserves and DAC for a net charge of $352 million ($278 million, net of income tax).\n•\nChanges in biometric assumptions resulted in favorable impacts to reserves and DAC for a net gain of $45 million ($31 million, net of income tax).\n•\nChanges in policyholder behavior assumptions resulted in unfavorable impacts to reserves and DAC for a net charge of $30 million ($28 million, net of income tax).\n•\nChanges in operational assumptions resulted in slightly favorable impacts to reserves and unfavorable impacts to DAC for a net charge of $41 million ($26 million, net of income tax).\nResults for 2019 include a $201 million ($162 million, net of income tax) charge associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions related to reserves and DAC, of which a $31 million ($27 million, net of income tax) loss was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $201 million charge, $49 million ($37 million, net of income tax) was related to DAC and $152 million ($125 million, net of income tax) was associated with reserves. The portion of the $201 million charge that is included in adjusted earnings is $179 million ($143 million, net of income tax). Certain other insurance adjustments recorded in 2019 include a $22 million ($17 million, net of income tax) charge due to a 2019 increase in our IBNR long-term care reserves reflecting enhancements to our methodology related to potential claims in our MetLife Holdings segment. This adjustment is included in adjusted earnings.\n72\nAdjusted Earnings.\nAs more fully described in\n“— Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures,”\nwe use adjusted earnings, which does not equate to net income (loss), as determined in accordance with GAAP, to analyze our performance, evaluate segment performance, and allocate resources. We believe that the presentation of adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings, as we measure it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings allow analysis of our performance relative to our business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results. Adjusted earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income (loss). Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders and adjusted earnings available to common shareholders on a constant currency basis should not be viewed as substitutes for net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders. Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders\ndecreased\n$144 million, net of income tax, to\n$5.6\nbillion, net of income tax, for 2020 from $5.8 billion, net of income tax, for 2019.\n73\nReconciliation of net income (loss) to adjusted earnings available to common shareholders and premiums, fees and other revenues to adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues\nYear Ended December 31, 2020\n74\nYear Ended December 31, 2019\n__________________\n(1)\nAmounts for U.S., MetLife Holdings and Corporate & Other are shown on a reported basis, as constant currency impact is not significant.\n75\nConsolidated Results — Adjusted Earnings\nBusiness Overview.\nAdjusted premiums, fees and other revenues for 2020 decreased $7 million, or less than 1%, compared to 2019. Adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, net of foreign currency fluctuations, increased $340 million, or 1%, compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in our U.S. segment, despite negative impacts from the COVID-19 Pandemic and related restrictions. Growth in core and voluntary products in our Group Benefits business was partially offset by a decline in our RIS business and a decrease in exposures in our Property & Casualty (“P&C”) business. The decrease in RIS was mainly driven by decreases in our structured settlement and institutional income annuity businesses, due to market conditions, partially offset by an increase in our pension risk transfer business. An increase in our EMEA segment was due to business growth across the region. In addition, an increase in our Asia segment reflects the impact in both years of our annual actuarial assumption review, which resulted in higher fees from foreign currency-denominated life products in 2020, partially offset by lower premiums from yen-denominated life products in Japan and the disposition of MetLife Hong Kong in 2019. A decrease in our Latin America segment was mainly driven by lower annuitizations in Chile due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our MetLife Holdings segment consists of operations relating to products and businesses, previously included in our former retail business, that we no longer actively market in the United States. We anticipate an average decline in adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues of approximately 5% to 7% per year in our MetLife Holdings segment from expected business run-off.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nOverview.\nThe primary drivers of the decrease in adjusted earnings were lower investment yields and a higher effective tax rate. These declines were partially offset by higher net investment income due to a larger asset base, and a decrease in expenses, including interest credited expenses.\nForeign Currency\n. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an $86 million negative impact on adjusted earnings for 2020 compared to 2019. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.\nBusiness Growth.\nWe benefited from positive net flows from many of our businesses, which increased our invested asset base. Growth in the investment portfolios of all of our segments and Corporate & Other resulted in higher net investment income. However, consistent with the growth in average invested assets, interest credited expenses on certain insurance-related liabilities increased. Also, an increase in expenses was primarily due to the 2020 reinstatement of the annual health insurer fee under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) and was more than offset by a corresponding increase in adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues. In addition, lower fee income in our MetLife Holdings segment was partially offset by increases in our other segments. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth, in addition to lower DAC amortization, resulted in a $451 million increase in adjusted earnings.\nMarket Factors.\nMarket factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns, and foreign currency fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on net investment income in our non-U.S. segments and changes in inflation rates on our inflation-indexed investments, investment yields decreased. Investment yields were negatively affected by lower yields on fixed income securities and mortgage loans, and lower returns on FVO Securities and real estate investments. These decreases in net investment income were partially offset by higher net investment income on derivatives. The impact of interest rate fluctuations resulted in a decline in our average interest credited rates on deposit-type and long-duration liabilities, which drove a decrease in interest credited expenses. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $349 million decrease in adjusted earnings.\nUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments.\nFavorable underwriting experience resulted in an $82 million increase in adjusted earnings and reflected impacts from the COVID-19 Pandemic and related restrictions. Favorable morbidity in our U.S., MetLife Holdings and EMEA segments, as well as a decrease in non-catastrophe claims in our P&C business were partially offset by unfavorable mortality in our U.S., Latin America and MetLife Holdings segments, as well as higher catastrophe-related claims in our Property & Casualty business. The impact in both years of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a net decrease of $60 million in adjusted earnings, primarily due to changes in economic assumptions. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities in both years resulted in an $88 million decrease in adjusted earnings, which included the impact of favorable insurance adjustments in 2019 resulting from enhancements to our claim-related processes, as well as a 2019 charge due to an increase in our IBNR long-term care reserves reflecting enhancements to our methodology related to potential claims.\n76\nExpenses\n. Expenses decreased compared to 2019, primarily due to declines in costs associated with corporate initiatives and projects, certain corporate-related expenses and employee-related costs. The decrease in expenses resulted in a $567 million increase in adjusted earnings.\nTaxes.\nOur 2020 effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 19%. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits from non-taxable investment income, tax credits and the finalization of bankruptcy proceedings for a leveraged lease investment, partially offset by tax charges from foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate. Our 2019 effective tax rate on adjusted earnings was 10%. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits from non-taxable investment income and tax credits, the resolution of an uncertainty regarding the deemed repatriation transition tax enacted as a part of U.S. Tax Reform and the settlement of certain tax audits, partially offset by tax charges from foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate.\n77\nSegment Results and Corporate & Other\nU.S.\nBusiness Overview.\nAdjusted premiums, fees and other revenues for 2020 increased $526 million, or 2%, compared to 2019, attributable to higher premiums in our Group Benefits business, partially offset by decreases in our RIS and P&C businesses. The increase in Group Benefits was primarily due to growth in core and voluntary products despite negative pressures from the economic impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Growth in our core products was driven by increases in our group life and vision businesses. In our dental business, higher premiums due to business growth were more than offset by premium credits granted to customers due to COVID-19 Pandemic restrictions. Growth in our voluntary products increased across the segment, driven by the impact of new sales and growth in membership in our accident & health and legal plans businesses. The decrease in RIS was mainly driven by decreases in our structured settlement and institutional income annuity businesses, due to market conditions, partially offset by an increase in our pension risk transfer business. Changes in RIS premiums are mostly offset by a corresponding change in policyholder benefits. The decrease in P&C was primarily driven by a decrease in exposures in both the auto and homeowners businesses, as well as the impact of premium credits granted to customers as a result of COVID-19 Pandemic restrictions, partially offset by the impact of pricing actions, mainly in the homeowners business.\nGrowth in RIS’s capital market investments and stable value businesses resulted in higher fees and interest margins.\nFor information regarding the Company's pending disposition of MetLife P&C and the acquisition of Versant Health, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n78\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nBusiness Growth\n. The impact of positive flows from pension risk transfer transactions in 2019, funding agreement issuances and structured settlements resulted in higher average invested assets, improving net investment income. However, consistent with the growth in average invested assets, interest credited expenses on long-duration and deposit-type liabilities increased. Higher volume-related, premium tax and direct expenses, driven by business growth, coupled with the increase due to the 2020 reinstatement of the annual health insurer fee under the PPACA, were more than offset by a corresponding increase in adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues and lower pension and post-retirement expenses. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth increased adjusted earnings by $156 million.\nMarket Factors.\nMarket factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns and foreign currency fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields decreased primarily driven by lower yields on fixed income securities and mortgage loans, as well as lower returns on real estate investments. These decreases were partially offset by increases in net investment income on derivatives and securities lending income. The impact of interest rate fluctuations resulted in a decrease in our average interest credited rates on deposit-type and long-duration liabilities, which drove a decrease in interest credited expenses. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $116 million increase in adjusted earnings.\nUnderwriting and Other Insurance Adjustments\n. Favorable claims experience, coupled with the impact of growth in our Group Benefits business, resulted in a $363 million increase in adjusted earnings. This increase was primarily driven by: (i) favorable dental results, driven by the impact of COVID-19 Pandemic restrictions which limited availability of services and reduced utilization in the current period; (ii) the impact of business growth and favorable claims experience in our accident & health business; and (iii) favorable claims experience in our group disability business, partially offset by less favorable individual disability results. Favorable mortality in our RIS business resulted in an increase in adjusted earnings of $154 million, driven by our pension risk transfer, institutional income annuity and structured settlement businesses. Unfavorable mortality in our Group Benefits business resulted in a decrease in adjusted earnings of $407 million. This was primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19 claims experience across our life businesses, as well as the impact of lower incidence in 2019 in our term life business, partially offset by favorable results in our accidental death & dismemberment business due to lower incidence as a result of COVID-19 Pandemic restrictions. In our P&C business, adjusted earnings increased $62 million due to a decrease in non-catastrophe claims costs of $197 million, partially offset by a $108 million increase in catastrophe-related claims costs, primarily driven by Northeast and Midwest storms, and the impact of adverse prior year development of $27 million. The decrease in non-catastrophe claims costs was the result of lower frequencies, primarily in our auto business, driven by the impact of lower mileage driven due to the impact of COVID-19 Pandemic restrictions, partially offset by higher severity. Refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities in both years resulted in a $59 million decrease in adjusted earnings, which included the impact of favorable insurance adjustments in 2019 resulting from enhancements to our claim-related processes.\n79\nAsia\nBusiness Overview.\nAdjusted premiums, fees and other revenues for 2020 increased $162 million, or 2%, compared to 2019. Adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, net of foreign currency fluctuations, increased $51 million, or 1%, compared to 2019, mainly due to the impact in both periods of our annual actuarial assumption review, which resulted in higher fees from foreign currency-denominated life products in 2020, partially offset by lower premiums from yen-denominated life products in Japan and the disposition of MetLife Hong Kong in 2019.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nForeign Currency.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates decreased adjusted earnings slightly for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the weakening of the Australian dollar and Korean won, essentially offset by the strengthening of the Japanese Yen against the U.S. dollar. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.\nBusiness Growth\n. Positive net flows in Japan and Korea resulted in higher average invested assets, which improved net investment income. The increase in net investment income was partially offset by a corresponding increase in interest credited expenses on certain insurance liabilities. The decrease in Asia’s adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues from yen-denominated life products in Japan and the disposition of MetLife Hong Kong in 2019 was partially offset by a related decline in policyholder benefits. Lower commissions and other variable expenses, net of DAC capitalization, resulted in an increase to adjusted earnings. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth improved adjusted earnings by $132 million.\n80\nMarket Factors\n. Market factors, including interest rate levels and variability in equity market returns, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields were unfavorably impacted by lower yields on fixed income securities supporting products sold in Japan denominated in Australian dollar, U.S. dollar and, to a lesser extent, Japanese yen. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by increased net investment income on derivatives and higher returns on private equity funds. The changes in market factors discussed above increased adjusted earnings by $20 million.\nUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments.\nLower claims, primarily in Japan and Korea, increased adjusted earnings by $16 million. The impact in both years of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a net decrease of $9 million in adjusted earnings. Refinements to certain insurance liabilities and other liabilities in both years resulted in a $10 million decrease in adjusted earnings.\nExpenses and Taxes\n. Lower expenses in Japan, including advertising, printing, consulting and travel costs, partially offset by higher corporate overhead, resulted in a $14 million increase in adjusted earnings. Tax-related impacts in both periods resulted in a net decrease in adjusted earnings of $2 million.\nLatin America\nBusiness Overview.\nAdjusted premiums, fees and other revenues for 2020 decreased $564 million, or 15%, compared to 2019. Adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, net of foreign currency fluctuations, decreased $131 million, or 4%, compared to 2019, mainly driven by lower annuitizations in Chile due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nForeign Currency.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates decreased adjusted earnings by $74 million for 2020 compared to 2019, mainly due to the weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily the Mexican and Chilean pesos. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.\n81\nBusiness Growth\n. Despite the aforementioned decrease in annuity premiums in Chile driven by the COVID-19 Pandemic, Latin America experienced growth in Mexico. The decrease in premiums in Chile was offset by related changes in policyholder benefits. An increase in average invested assets, primarily in Chile, generated higher net investment income. In addition, interest credited expenses on certain insurance liabilities decreased and policy fee income increased in our universal life business in Mexico. Business growth also drove an increase in commissions and other variable expenses, net of DAC capitalization. The combined impact of the items affecting business growth increased adjusted earnings by $55 million.\nMarket Factors.\nMarket factors, including interest rate levels and variability in equity market returns, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields decreased driven by lower yields on fixed income securities and mortgage loans,\nthe unfavorable impact of equity market returns on our Chilean encaje within FVO Securities,\nas well as lower returns on private equity funds and lower net investment income on derivatives. The changes in market factors discussed above, partially offset by a decrease in interest credited expenses, decreased adjusted earnings by $94 million.\nUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments.\nUnfavorable underwriting drove a $197 million decrease in adjusted earnings which includes impacts from COVID-19-related life claims, primarily in Mexico. The impact in both years of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a net decrease of $19 million in adjusted earnings. Refinements to certain insurance liabilities and other liabilities in both years resulted in a $9 million increase in adjusted earnings.\nExpenses and Taxes.\nAdjusted earnings increased by $16 million, primarily driven by lower expenses due to COVID-19 Pandemic restrictions. Adjusted earnings decreased by $17 million primarily driven by reduced tax charges in 2019 as a result of tax regulations related to U.S. Tax Reform. Other tax-related adjustments in both years resulted in a net decrease in adjusted earnings of $7 million.\n82\nEMEA\nBusiness Overview.\nAdjusted premiums, fees and other revenues for 2020 increased $90 million, or 3%, compared to 2019. Adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, net of foreign currency fluctuations, increased $115 million, or 4%, compared to 2019 due to growth across the region, mainly in our accident & health business, our credit life business in Turkey and Europe and our corporate solutions business in Egypt and the U.K. These improvements were partially offset by a decrease in our retirement business in the U.K., as well as the impact in both years of our annual actuarial assumption review.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nForeign Currency.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates decreased adjusted earnings by $11 million for 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Turkish lira. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.\nBusiness Growth\n. Growth across the region, mainly in our credit life business in Turkey, our accident & health business in Europe and our pension business in Romania increased adjusted earnings by $19 million.\nMarket Factors.\nMarket factors, including interest rate levels and variability in equity market returns, continued to impact our results. DAC amortization increased in our variable life business. In addition, investment yields were lower across the region. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $25 million decrease in adjusted earnings.\n83\nUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments.\nAdjusted earnings increased by $22 million as a result of favorable underwriting experience in our corporate solutions business across the majority of the region, partially offset by unfavorable underwriting in our accident & health business in Greece and in our ordinary life business in France. Underwriting results reflect impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic and related restrictions. The impact in both years of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a net decrease of $18 million in adjusted earnings. Refinements to certain insurance-related assets and liabilities in both years resulted in an $8 million decrease in adjusted earnings.\nExpenses and Taxes\n. Adjusted earnings increased by $64 million, mainly driven by lower compensation-related expenses, lower costs associated with enterprise-wide initiatives, and various other expense decreases. Tax-related adjustments in both years slightly increased adjusted earnings.\nMetLife Holdings\nBusiness Overview.\nOur MetLife Holdings segment consists of operations relating to products and businesses, previously included in our former retail business, that we no longer actively market in the United States. We anticipate an average decline in adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues of approximately 5% to 7% per year from expected business run-off. A significant portion of our adjusted earnings is driven by separate account balances. Most directly, these balances determine asset-based fee income but they also impact DAC amortization and asset-based commissions. Separate account balances are driven by movements in the market, surrenders, deposits, withdrawals, benefit payments, transfers and policy charges. Although we have discontinued selling our long-term care product, we continue to collect premiums and administer the existing block of business, which contributed to asset growth in the segment, and we expect the related reserves to grow as this block matures. Our future policyholder benefit liability for our long-term care business was $14.3 billion and $12.5 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n84\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nBusiness Growth.\nNegative net flows from our deferred annuities business and a decrease in universal life deposits resulted in lower fee income. Also, in our deferred annuity business, higher costs associated with our variable annuity GMDBs resulted in a decrease in adjusted earnings. These decreases were partially offset by higher net investment income, resulting from a higher invested asset base, as well as lower DAC amortization. The higher invested asset base was primarily the result of positive net flows in our long-term care business. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth resulted in a $34 million decrease in adjusted earnings.\nMarket Factors\n. Market factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns, and foreign currency fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields decreased primarily due to lower yields on fixed income securities and mortgage loans, as well as lower returns on real estate investments. These decreases were partially offset by higher net investment income on derivatives. In our deferred annuity business, higher costs associated with our variable annuity GMDBs resulted in a decrease in adjusted earnings. These unfavorable earnings impacts were partially offset by an increase in asset-based fee income and lower DAC amortization. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $76 million decrease in adjusted earnings.\nUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review, and Other Insurance Adjustments\n. Favorable underwriting, mainly in our long-term care and universal life businesses, partially offset by unfavorable underwriting in our traditional life business resulted in a $63 million increase in adjusted earnings, which reflects the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic. The impact in both years of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a net decrease of $14 million in adjusted earnings. Changes mainly in economic assumptions, including interest rate projections, and updates to the closed block projections, were slightly more unfavorable in 2020 when compared to 2019. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities in both years resulted in a $20 million decrease in adjusted earnings. This includes a 2019 charge due to an increase in our IBNR long-term care reserves reflecting enhancements to our methodology related to potential claims. A reduction in our dividend scale as a result of the sustained low interest rate environment, as well as run-off in MLIC’s closed block, contributed to lower dividend expense and resulted in an increase of $106 million in adjusted earnings. The impact of this dividend action was more than offset by lower net investment income, as well as a $97 million increase in DAC amortization.\nExpenses\n. Adjusted earnings increased by $16 million mainly due to lower operational costs, as well as lower pension and post-retirement benefits.\n85\nCorporate & Other\nThe table below presents adjusted earnings available to common shareholders by source:\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nUnless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.\nBusiness Activities.\nAdjusted earnings from business activities increased $21 million. This was primarily related to improved results from certain of our businesses.\nNet Investment Income\n. Net investment income declined $186 million, primarily due to decreased returns on our equity market sensitive investments, including private equity funds, as well as lower yields on our fixed income securities.\nInterest Expense on Debt\n. Interest expense on debt decreased by $28 million, primarily due to the excess premium associated with redeemed debt in 2019, as well as the impact of a decrease in three-month LIBOR on our surplus notes, partially offset by the issuance of senior notes at lower interest rates in March 2020 and May 2019.\n86\nCorporate Initiatives and Projects.\nAdjusted earnings increased $319 million due to lower expenses associated with corporate initiatives and projects, primarily due to 2019 costs related to our unit cost initiative.\nProvision for Income Tax (Expense) Benefit and Other Tax-Related Items\n. An unfavorable change in Corporate & Other’s taxes was primarily due to 2019 tax benefits related to the resolution of an uncertainty regarding the deemed repatriation transition tax enacted as a part of U.S. Tax Reform and the settlement of certain tax audits related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of MLIC. In addition, lower utilization of tax preferenced items, which include non-taxable investment income, tax credits, foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate and taxes on stock compensation, was partially offset by the finalization of bankruptcy proceedings for a leveraged lease investment.\nOther.\nAdjusted earnings increased $141 million, primarily as a result of decreases in certain corporate-related expenses, lower employee-related costs, and a 2019 loss related to the sale of a run-off business that was previously reinsured, partially offset by higher interest expenses on tax positions due to 2019 audit settlements and higher legal expenses.\nPreferred Stock Dividends.\nAdjusted earnings available to common shareholders decreased $24 million as a result of dividends paid on the 4.75% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series F we issued in January 2020, partially offset by changes in dividend payments on and the partial redemption of the Series C preferred stock.\nEffects of Inflation\nManagement believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates.\nAn increase in inflation could affect our business in several ways. During inflationary periods, the value of fixed income investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized losses. Inflation also increases expenses for labor and other costs, potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs cannot be passed through in our product prices. Inflation could also lead to increased costs for losses and loss adjustment expenses in certain of our businesses, which could require us to adjust our pricing to reflect our expectations for future inflation. Prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally, and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, which could constrain overall economic activity, inhibit revenue growth and reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities.\n87\nInvestments\nInvestment Risks\nOur primary investment objective is to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis. The Investments Department, led by the Chief Investment Officer, manages investment risks using a risk control framework comprised of policies, procedures and limits, as discussed further below. The Investment Risk Committee and Asset-Liability Steering Committee review and monitor investment risk limits and tolerances.\nWe are exposed to the following primary sources of investment risks:\n•\ncredit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest;\n•\ninterest rate risk, relating to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates. Changes in market interest rates will impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of our fixed income investment portfolio and the rates of return we receive on both new funds invested and reinvestment of existing funds;\n•\nliquidity risk, relating to the diminished ability to sell certain investments, in times of strained market conditions;\n•\nmarket valuation risk, relating to the variability in the estimated fair value of investments associated with changes in market factors such as credit spreads and equity market levels. A widening of credit spreads will adversely impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio, will increase losses associated with credit-based non-qualifying derivatives where we assume credit exposure, and, if credit spreads widen significantly or for an extended period of time, will likely result in higher credit losses. Credit spread tightening will reduce net investment income associated with purchases of fixed income investments and will favorably impact the net unrealized gain (loss) position of the fixed income investment portfolio;\n•\ncurrency risk, relating to the variability in currency exchange rates for foreign denominated investments including as a result of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU. This risk relates to potential decreases in estimated fair value and net investment income resulting from changes in currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar. In general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the estimated fair value of our foreign denominated investments; and\n•\nreal estate risk, relating to commercial, agricultural and residential real estate, and stemming from factors, which include, but are not limited to, market conditions, including the supply and demand of leasable commercial space, creditworthiness of borrowers, tenants and our joint venture partners, capital markets volatility, changes in market interest rates, commodity prices, farm incomes and U.S. housing market conditions.\nWe manage investment risk through in-house fundamental credit analysis of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and real estate properties. We also manage credit, market and liquidity risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation. These risk limits, approved annually by the Investment Risk Committee, promote diversification by asset sector, avoid concentrations in any single issuer and limit overall aggregate credit and equity risk exposure, as measured by our economic capital framework. For real estate assets, we manage credit and market risk through asset allocation and by diversifying by geography, property and product type. We manage interest rate risk as part of our ALM strategies which are reviewed and approved by the Asset-Liability Steering Committee. These strategies include maintaining an investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration that reflects the duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile, and utilizing product design, such as the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges, to manage interest rate risk. We also manage interest rate risk through proactive monitoring and management of certain NGEs of our products, such as the resetting of credited interest and dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments. In addition to hedging with foreign currency derivatives, we manage currency risk by matching much of our foreign currency liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency assets, thereby reducing our risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. We also use certain derivatives in the management of credit, interest rate, and market valuation risk.\n88\nWe enter into market standard purchased and written credit default swap contracts. Payout under such contracts is triggered by certain credit events experienced by the referenced entities. For credit default swaps covering North American corporate issuers, credit events typically include bankruptcy and failure to pay on borrowed money. For European corporate issuers, credit events typically also include involuntary restructuring. With respect to credit default contracts on sovereign debt, credit events typically include failure to pay debt obligations, repudiation, moratorium, or involuntary restructuring. In each case, payout on a credit default swap is triggered only after the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association determines that a credit event has occurred.\nWe use purchased credit default swaps to mitigate credit risk in our investment portfolio. Generally, we purchase credit protection by entering into credit default swaps referencing the issuers of specific assets we own. In certain cases, basis risk exists between these credit default swaps and the specific assets we own. For example, we may purchase credit protection on a macro basis to reduce exposure to specific industries or other portfolio concentrations. In such instances, the referenced entities and obligations under the credit default swaps may not be identical to the individual obligors or securities in our investment portfolio. In addition, our purchased credit default swaps may have shorter tenors than the underlying investments they are hedging, which gives us more flexibility in managing our credit exposures. We believe that our purchased credit default swaps serve as effective economic hedges of our credit exposure.\nCurrent Environment\nAs a global insurance company, we continue to be impacted by the changing global financial and economic environment, the fiscal and monetary policy of governments and central banks around the world and other governmental measures. The COVID-19 Pandemic continues to impact the global economy and financial markets and has caused volatility in the global equity, credit and real estate markets. See “— Industry Trends — Financial and Economic Environment.”\nGovernments and central banks around the world are responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic with unprecedented fiscal and monetary policies, which are expected to have significant and ongoing effects on financial markets and the global economy. These policy responses include fiscal and monetary stimulus measures, including, but not limited to, financial assistance, liquidity programs, new financing facilities and reductions in the level of interest rates. As time progresses, we will know more about the efficacy of these policies and what they may mean for the outlook for the global economy and financial markets, but currently the number of factors makes reliably estimating the duration and severity of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives difficult.\nAs a result of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, during the year ended December 31, 2020, there was an economic slowdown and volatility in the financial markets, including liquidity driven price dislocation and credit spread widening. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the value of certain investments within our portfolio decreased; however, some of those effects were mitigated by an increase in the value of certain freestanding derivatives that hedge such market risks. These conditions may persist for some time and may continue to impact pricing levels of risk-bearing investments, as well as our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives.\n89\nSelected Country and Sector Investments\nSelected Country: We have a market presence in numerous countries and, therefore, our investment portfolio, which supports our insurance operations and related policyholder liabilities, as well as our global portfolio diversification objectives, is exposed to risks posed by local political and economic conditions, as well as those resulting from the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our investment portfolios in the countries in the table below are currently the most affected by these conditions. The following table presents a summary of selected country fixed maturity securities AFS, at estimated fair value. The information below is presented on a “country of risk basis” (e.g. where the issuer primarily conducts business).\nIn the second quarter of 2020, Argentina defaulted on its foreign currency denominated sovereign fixed maturity securities. In the third quarter of 2020, Argentina exchanged new sovereign fixed maturity securities for substantially all of its defaulted foreign currency denominated sovereign fixed maturity securities. As a result of the economic conditions prior to the default, the Company impaired its holdings of such securities initially in the fourth quarter of 2019 and then, in the first quarter of 2020, recorded an ACL. Through June 30, 2020, the prior impairment and ACL on the defaulted securities totaled $155 million. In the third quarter of 2020, the Company exchanged securities with a par value and amortized cost net of ACL of $361 million and $146 million, respectively, plus accrued investment income of $11 million, for new securities with an estimated fair value of $182 million which resulted in a net gain of $25 million recorded in net investment gain (loss). In connection with the disposition of MetLife Seguros de Retiro in October 2020, the Company reduced its exposure to Argentina sovereign fixed maturity securities, as the assets disposed included $132 million of such securities at amortized cost. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n__________________\n(1)\nSovereign includes government and agency.\n(2)\nThe par value and amortized cost net of ACL of these selected country fixed maturity securities AFS were $24.4 billion and $25.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2020.\n(3)\nThe sovereign securities amount\ns\nfor Argentina and Lebanon were net of ACL of $19 million and $2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020. See “— Investment Allowance for Credit Loss and Impairments\n-\nOverview.”\n90\nSelected Sector: As a result of current economic conditions, including the effects on the global economy and financial markets from the COVID-19 Pandemic, certain sectors of our investment portfolio experienced stress during the year ended December 31, 2020. Our fixed maturity securities AFS exposure to stressed sectors is summarized below:\n__________________\n(1)\nFixed maturity securities AFS at amortized cost, net of ACL.\n(2)\nThe estimated fair value of these fixed maturity securities AFS was $14.6 billion at December 31, 2020.\n(3)\nRepresents total cash, cash equivalents and invested assets.\nWe maintain a portfolio of energy sector fixed maturity securities AFS that is diversified across sub-sectors and issuers. This portfolio is primarily invested in higher quality, highly rated investment grade securities and is defensively positioned in sub-sectors which are less impacted by lower oil prices. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we reduced our exposure to such securities by 13%. Through our energy sector securities, we have exposure to the volatility in oil prices. During 2020, largely as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, there were wide fluctuations in\noil prices. As a result of recovering oil prices and credit spread tightening in the fourth quarter of 2020, this securities portfolio increased in value during the year ended December 31, 2020, from an unrealized gain at December 31, 2019 of $849 million to an unrealized gain of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020.\nAdditional asset types within our investment portfolio may be impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic, including fixed maturity securities AFS (including below investment grade securities and structured products), equity securities, Unit-linked investments, FVO Securities, mortgage loans, real estate and real estate joint ventures, private equity funds, hedge funds and lease investments. See “— Executive Summary — Consolidated Company Outlook.”\nWe manage direct and indirect investment exposure in the selected countries, sectors and asset types through fundamental analysis and we continually monitor and adjust our level of investment exposure.\nInvestment Allowance for Credit Loss and Impairments - Overview\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted the new credit loss guidance. See “— Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Investment Allowance for Credit Loss and Impairments.” For our mortgage loans and leveraged and direct financing leases, this new credit loss guidance requires that we incorporate the impact of both current and forecasted economic conditions and estimate expected lifetime credit loss in determining the ACL. Upon adoption of this new credit loss guidance, our ACL reflected the then current and forecasted economic conditions and our estimate of expected lifetime credit loss. Subsequently, we incorporated the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic into our economic forecast, using available information, to reflect our best estimate, in determining the level of our ACL for mortgage loans and leveraged and direct financing leases.\nUpon adoption of the new credit loss guidance, we increased our mortgage loan and lease ACL and liability for unfunded mortgage loan commitments by $141 million, or 40%. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we increased our mortgage loan and lease ACL and liability for unfunded mortgage loan commitments by another $150 million, or 42%. Our mortgage loan and lease ACL and liability for unfunded mortgage loan commitments totaled $643 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of 82% from December 31, 2019.\n91\nIn accordance with this new credit loss guidance, an ACL is recorded for fixed maturity securities AFS for the amount of the credit loss instead of recording a reduction of the amortized cost as an impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an ACL for our fixed maturity securities AFS of $81 million. As a result, our total investments-related ACL and liability for unfunded mortgage loan commitments totaled $724 million at December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a charge for provisions for credit loss and impairments of $488 million, prior to the release of the ACL for securities subsequently sold or exchanged of $133 million. In addition, there was an additional $11 million decrease in the ACL during the year ended December 31, 2020, in connection with the disposition of MetLife Seguros de Retiro.\nThe determination of the amount of our ACL and impairments on our investment portfolio is highly subjective. Our ACL is revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Provisions for credit loss and impairments recognized in future quarters on our investment portfolio will depend primarily on future economic fundamentals, including the evolving impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, performance of our issuers, borrowers, tenants and lessees, changes in credit ratings, collateral valuation and changes in estimated fair value. In upcoming periods, if there are changes in the above factors, provisions for credit loss and impairments may be recorded, as well as changes in the ACL for which a provision for credit loss was previously recorded.\nInvestment Portfolio Results\nThe reconciliation of net investment income under GAAP to adjusted net investment income is presented below.\n__________________\n(1)\nSee “Financial Measures and Segment Accounting Policies” in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the adjustments made to net investment income under GAAP in calculating adjusted net investment income.\nThe following yield table presentation is consistent with how we measure our investment performance for management purposes, and we believe it enhances understanding of our investment portfolio results.\n__________________\n92\n(1)\nWe calculate yields using adjusted net investment income as a percent of average quarterly asset carrying values. Adjusted net investment income excludes recognized gains (losses) and includes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Average quarterly asset carrying values exclude unrealized gains (losses), collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, annuities funding structured settlement claims, freestanding derivative assets, collateral received from derivative counterparties, the effects of consolidating under GAAP certain variable interest entities that are treated as consolidated securitization entities (“CSEs”) and contractholder-directed equity securities. In addition, average quarterly asset carrying values include invested assets reclassified to held-for-sale. A yield is not presented for other invested assets, as it is not considered a meaningful measure of performance for this asset class.\n(2)\nInvestment income from fixed maturity securities includes amounts from FVO Securities of $140 million and $184 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(3)\nInvestment income from fixed maturity securities AFS and mortgage loans includes prepayment fees.\n(4)\nSee “— Real Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures” and “— Other Limited Partnership Interests” for discussion of results for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(5)\nSee “Financial Measures and Segment Accounting Policies” in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of divested businesses.\nSe\ne “— Results of Operations — Consolidated Results — Adjusted Earnings” for an analysis of the period over period changes in investment portfolio results.\nFixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity Securities\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic contributed to financial market volatility, credit spread widening and equity market volatility during the year ended December 31, 2020. Governments and central banks around the world have responded with unprecedented fiscal and monetary policies, including reductions in the level of interest rates. See “— Current Environment.”\nAs a result of the interest rate reductions, partially offset by credit spread widening, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the net unrealized gain on our fixed maturity securities AFS increased $13.9 billion, from $30.2 billion at December 31, 2019 to $44.1 billion at December 31, 2020. As a result of the equity market volatility during the year ended December 31, 2020, the value of our equity securities decreased, resulting in a mark-to-market loss of $153 million in net investment gains (losses), as the change in estimated fair value is recorded in net income.\nThe following table presents fixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities by type (public or private) and information about perpetual and redeemable securities held at:\nSee Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about fixed maturity securities AFS by sector, contractual maturities and continuous gross unrealized losses.\n93\nIncluded within fixed maturity securities AFS are structured securities, including residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”), ABS and commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) (collectively, “Structured Products”).\nPerpetual securities are included within fixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities. Upon acquisition, we classify perpetual securities that have attributes of both debt and equity as fixed maturity securities AFS if the securities have an interest rate step-up feature which, when combined with other qualitative factors, indicates that the securities have more debt-like characteristics; while those with more equity-like characteristics are classified as equity securities. Many of such securities, commonly referred to as “perpetual hybrid securities,” have been issued by non-U.S. financial institutions that are accorded the highest two capital treatment categories by their respective regulatory bodies (i.e. core capital, or “Tier 1 capital” and perpetual deferrable securities, or “Upper Tier 2 capital”).\nRedeemable preferred stock with a stated maturity is included within fixed maturity securities AFS. These securities, which are commonly referred to as “capital securities,” primarily have cumulative interest deferral features and are primarily issued by U.S. financial institutions.\nValuation of Securities\n. We are responsible for the determination of the estimated fair value of our investments. We determine the estimated fair value of publicly-traded securities after considering one of three primary sources of information: quoted market prices in active markets, independent pricing services, or independent broker quotations. We determine the estimated fair value of privately-placed securities after considering one of three primary sources of information: market standard internal matrix pricing, market standard internal discounted cash flow techniques, or independent pricing services (after we determine the independent pricing services’ use of available observable market data). For publicly-traded securities, the number of quotations obtained varies by instrument and depends on the liquidity of the particular instrument. Generally, we obtain prices from multiple pricing services to cover all asset classes and obtain multiple prices for certain securities, but ultimately utilize the price with the highest placement in the fair value hierarchy. Independent pricing services that value these instruments use market standard valuation methodologies based on data about market transactions and inputs from multiple pricing sources that are market observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the types of market standard valuation methodologies utilized and key assumptions and observable inputs used in applying these standard valuation methodologies. When a price is not available in the active market or through an independent pricing service, management values the security primarily using market standard internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques, and non-binding quotations from independent brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities. Independent non-binding broker quotations utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market data. As shown in the following section, less than 1% of our fixed maturity securities AFS were valued using non-binding quotations from independent brokers at December 31, 2020.\nSenior management, independent of the trading and investing functions, is responsible for the oversight of control systems and valuation policies for securities, mortgage loans and derivatives. On a quarterly basis, new transaction types and markets are reviewed and approved to ensure that observable market prices and market-based parameters are used for valuation, wherever possible, and for determining that valuation adjustments, when applied, are based upon established policies and are applied consistently over time. Senior management oversees the selection of independent third-party pricing providers and the controls and procedures to evaluate third-party pricing.\nWe review our valuation methodologies on an ongoing basis and revise those methodologies when necessary based on changing market conditions. Assurance is gained on the overall reasonableness and consistent application of input assumptions, valuation methodologies and compliance with fair value accounting standards through controls designed to ensure valuations represent an exit price. Several controls are utilized, including certain monthly controls, which include, but are not limited to, analysis of portfolio returns to corresponding benchmark returns, comparing a sample of executed prices of securities sold to the fair value estimates, comparing fair value estimates to management’s knowledge of the current market, reviewing the bid/ask spreads to assess activity, comparing prices from multiple independent pricing services and ongoing due diligence to confirm that independent pricing services use market-based parameters. The process includes a determination of the observability of inputs used in estimated fair values received from independent pricing services or brokers by assessing whether these inputs can be corroborated by observable market data. We ensure that prices received from independent brokers, also referred to herein as “consensus pricing,” are representative of estimated fair value by considering such pricing relative to our knowledge of the current market dynamics and current pricing for similar financial instruments. While independent non-binding broker quotations are utilized, they are not used for a significant portion of the portfolio.\n94\nWe also apply a formal process to challenge any prices received from independent pricing services that are not considered representative of estimated fair value. If prices received from independent pricing services are not considered reflective of market activity or representative of estimated fair value, independent non-binding broker quotations are obtained, or an internally developed valuation is prepared. Internally developed valuations of current estimated fair value, compared with pricing received from the independent pricing services, did not produce material differences in the estimated fair values for the majority of the portfolio; accordingly, overrides were not material. This is, in part, because internal estimates are generally based on available market evidence and estimates used by other market participants. In the absence of such market-based evidence, management’s best estimate is used.\nWe have reviewed the significance and observability of inputs used in the valuation methodologies to determine the appropriate fair value hierarchy level for each of our securities. Based on the results of this review and investment class analysis, each instrument is categorized as Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the lowest level significant input to its valuation. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for valuation approaches and key inputs by major category of assets or liabilities that are classified within Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nFair Value of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity Securities\nFixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value pricing sources are as follows:\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities fair value hierarchy.\nThe majority of the Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities were concentrated in three sectors at December 31, 2020: foreign corporate securities, U.S. corporate securities and RMBS. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS increased by $10.7 billion, or 57%. The increase was driven by transfers into Level 3 in excess of transfers out of Level 3, purchases in excess of sales and by an increase in estimated fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). The increase in transfers into Level 3 for the year ended December 31, 2020, in part, was from market conditions including decreased liquidity, decreased transparency of valuations and an increased use of unobservable inputs, principally for U.S. and foreign corporate securities.\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a rollforward of the fair value measurements for securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs; transfers into and/or out of Level 3; and further information about the valuation approaches and inputs by level by major classes of invested assets that affect the amounts reported above.\nFixed Maturity Securities AFS\nSee Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about fixed maturity securities AFS by sector, contractual maturities and continuous gross unrealized losses.\n95\nFixed Maturity Securities AFS Credit Quality — Ratings\nThe Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC evaluates the fixed maturity security investments of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes. Historically, the NAIC assigned securities to one of six credit quality categories called “NAIC designations.” If no designation is available from the NAIC, then, as permitted by the NAIC, an internally developed designation is used. NAIC designations are generally similar to the credit quality ratings of the NRSRO for fixed maturity securities, except for certain non-agency RMBS and CMBS as described below.\nEffective with year-end 2020 NAIC reporting, the NAIC implemented an expansion of the fixed maturity security rating classification from six to 20 categories. The NAIC retained the six NAIC designations and expanded with 20 “NAIC designation categories.” The NAIC designation categories correspond more closely to the NRSROs alpha-numeric credit quality ratings. The NAIC’s goal is to better align RBC charges on fixed maturity securities with the instruments’ actual credit risk. Effective with year-end 2020 regulatory reporting, insurers are required to report both the NAIC designation and NAIC designation category for each fixed maturity security. The NAIC maintained the current RBC factors for NAIC designations 1-6 until the NAIC completes an impact analysis  to confirm or refine the NAIC’s proposed new RBC factors for the 20 NAIC designation categories.\nRating agency ratings are based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the NAIC credit rating provider list, including Moody’s Investor Service (“Moody’s”), S&P, Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”), Dominion Bond Rating Service, A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Egan Jones Ratings Company and Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC (“Morningstar”). If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.\nThe NAIC has adopted revised methodologies for non-agency RMBS and CMBS. The NAIC’s objective with the revised methodologies for non-agency RMBS and CMBS was to increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses, and to use the improved assessment to determine a more appropriate capital requirement for non-agency RMBS and CMBS. The revised methodologies reduce regulatory reliance on rating agencies and allow for greater regulatory input into the assumptions used to estimate expected losses from non-agency RMBS and CMBS. We apply the revised NAIC methodologies to non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries that maintain the NAIC statutory basis of accounting. The NAIC’s present methodology is to evaluate non-agency RMBS and CMBS held by insurers using the revised NAIC methodologies on an annual basis. If MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries acquire non-agency RMBS and CMBS that have not been previously evaluated by the NAIC, but are expected to be evaluated by the NAIC in the upcoming annual review, an internally developed designation is used until a NAIC designation becomes available. NAIC designations may not correspond to NRSRO ratings.\n96\nThe following table presents total fixed maturity securities AFS by NRSRO rating and the applicable NAIC designation from the NAIC published comparison of NRSRO ratings to NAIC designations, except for non-agency RMBS and CMBS, held by MetLife, Inc.'s insurance subsidiaries that maintain the NAIC statutory basis of accounting, which are presented using revised NAIC methodologies. NRSRO ratings are as of the dates shown below. Over time, credit ratings can migrate, up or down, through the NRSRO continuous monitoring process. As of December 31, 2020, securities are presented net of ACL, reflecting the adoption of new credit loss guidance on January 1, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, securities are presented at amortized cost in accordance with prior guidance. See Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n(1)  Excludes gross unrealized gains (losses) related to assets held-for-sale. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the pending disposition of MetLife P&C.\nAs a result of current economic conditions, including the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic which caused increased concerns over more highly leveraged issuers and downgrade risk, our below investment grade securities initially decreased in value but, as a result of credit spread tightening in the fourth quarter of 2020, these securities increased in value from an unrealized gain position at December 31, 2019 of $342 million to an unrealized gain position of $958 million at December 31, 2020. Foreign government securities, acquired to support our local insurance operations and related policyholder liabilities, represented $3.7 billion, or 22% of our $17.1 billion below investment grade securities, at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2020. U.S. corporate and foreign corporate securities comprise the vast majority of the remaining below investment grade securities. We have been actively repositioning our corporate below investment grade portfolios, including our syndicated bank loan portfolio, into higher quality, higher rated securities and with an increased allocation to privately-placed securities that include covenant protections.\n97\nThe following tables present total fixed maturity securities AFS, based on estimated fair value, by sector and by NRSRO rating and the applicable NAIC designations from the NAIC published comparison of NRSRO ratings to NAIC designations, except for non-agency RMBS and CMBS, which are presented using the revised NAIC methodologies:\n98\nU.S. and Foreign Corporate Fixed Maturity Securities AFS\nWe maintain a diversified portfolio of corporate fixed maturity securities AFS across industries and issuers. This portfolio did not have any exposure to any single issuer in excess of 1% of total investments at December 31, 2020. The top 10 holdings comprised 2% of total investments at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. The table below presents our U.S. and foreign corporate securities holdings by industry at:\nAs a result of current economic conditions, including the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic, we have experienced stress within certain sub-sectors of our industrial and consumer corporate securities portfolios, principally in Energy, Airports, Cruise Lines / Leisure, Airlines, Restaurants and Lodging. See “— Current Environment — Selected Country and Sector Investments.”\nStructured Products\nWe held $59.5 billion and $53.5 billion of Structured Products, at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as presented in the RMBS, ABS and CMBS sections below.\nRMBS\nOur RMBS portfolio is diversified by security type and risk profile. The following table presents our RMBS portfolio by security type, risk profile and ratings profile at:\n99\n(1)  Excludes gross unrealized gains (losses) related to assets held-for-sale. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the pending disposition of MetLife P&C.\nCollateralized mortgage obligations are structured by dividing the cash flows of mortgage loans into separate pools or tranches of risk that create multiple classes of bonds with varying maturities and priority of payments. Pass-through mortgage-backed securities are secured by a mortgage loan or collection of mortgage loans. The monthly mortgage loan payments from homeowners pass from the originating bank through an intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank, which collects the payments and, for a fee, remits or passes these payments through to the holders of the pass-through securities.\nThe majority of our RMBS holdings were rated Aaa/AAA and were designated NAIC 1 at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Agency RMBS were guaranteed or otherwise supported by Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or Government National Mortgage Association. Non-agency RMBS include prime, alternative residential mortgage loans (“Alt-A”) and sub-prime RMBS. Prime residential mortgage lending includes the origination of residential mortgage loans to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. Alt-A is a classification of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime. Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles.\nHistorically, we have managed our exposure to sub-prime RMBS holdings by focusing primarily on senior tranche securities, stress testing the portfolio with severe loss assumptions and closely monitoring the performance of the portfolio. Our sub-prime RMBS portfolio consists predominantly of securities that were purchased after 2012 at significant discounts to par value and discounts to the expected principal recovery value of these securities. The vast majority of these securities are investment grade under the NAIC designations (e.g., NAIC 1 and NAIC 2).\nOur RMBS holdings were comprised of 67% Agency securities that were all designated NAIC 1 and 33% of non-agency securities, of which 93% were designated NAIC 1, at December 31, 2020. As result of current economic conditions, including increased unemployment levels as result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the unrealized gain on our non-agency RMBS holdings initially decreased but, as a result of credit spread tightening in the fourth quarter of 2020, these securities increased in value from an unrealized gain of $699 million at December 31, 2019 to an unrealized gain of $706 million at December 31, 2020. Our non-agency RMBS portfolio is defensively positioned with most of the portfolio concentrated in senior tranches with strong structural protections including credit enhancement in the form of capital structure subordination that is available to absorb losses before they impact the securities we own.\nABS\nOur ABS portfolio is diversified by collateral type and issuer. The following table presents our ABS portfolio by collateral type and ratings profile at:\n(1)  Excludes gross unrealized gains (losses) related to assets held-for-sale. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the pending disposition of MetLife P&C.\n100\n(2)  Includes primarily collateralized loan obligations.\nAs a result of current economic conditions, including the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic, causing increased concerns over leveraged lending, our $8.9 billion collateralized obligations securities portfolio, at estimated fair value, initially decreased in value but, as a result of credit spread tightening in the fourth quarter of 2020, these securities increased in value from an unrealized loss position of $54 million at December 31, 2019 to an unrealized loss position of $16 million at December 31, 2020. We have been actively repositioning this portfolio into higher quality, higher rated securities primarily collateralized by first lien senior secured loans. As a result, this portfolio includes strong structural protections, primarily credit enhancement in the form of capital structure subordination that is available to absorb losses before they impact the securities we own. We do not own equity tranches of such securities or combination notes in this portfolio. As we invest primarily in securities rated AAA, AA or A, 98% of this portfolio was investment grade rated at December 31, 2020.\nCMBS\nOur CMBS portfolio is comprised primarily of securities collateralized by multiple commercial mortgage loans and is diversified by property type, borrower, geography and vintage year. The following tables present our CMBS portfolio by NRSRO rating and vintage year. As of December 31, 2020, securities are presented net of ACL, reflecting the adoption of new credit loss guidance on January 1, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, securities are presented at amortized cost in accordance with the prior guidance. See Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nThe tables above reflect NRSRO ratings including Moody’s, S&P, Fitch and Morningstar, Inc. CMBS designated NAIC 1 were 88.8% and 97.1% of total CMBS at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n101\nEvaluation of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS for Credit Loss, Rollforward of Allowance for Credit Loss and Credit Loss on Fixed Maturity Securities AFS Recognized in Earnings\nSee Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the evaluation of fixed maturity securities AFS for credit loss, rollforward of the ACL, net provision (release) for credit loss, as well as gross gains and gross losses on fixed maturity securities AFS sold at and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nOverview of Credit Loss on Fixed Maturity Securities AFS\nExcluding the impact of securities with an ACL that were subsequently sold or exchanged and the related release of the ACL, the provision for credit loss on fixed maturity securities AFS was $225 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $129 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The provision for credit loss on foreign government securities was $134 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was concentrated in Argentine foreign currency denominated sovereign securities, as a result of their default in 2020. The provision for credit loss on U.S. corporate securities and foreign corporate securities was $91 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which were concentrated in industrial and consumer securities, as a result of market driven and issuer specific factors, primarily in the communications, energy and transportation sectors in 2020. See “— Current Environment — Selected Country and Sector Investments.”\nThe release of the ACL for securities that were subsequently sold or exchanged was $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Including the impact of these releases and impact of intent-to-sell impairments of $62 million, the net provision for credit loss on fixed maturity securities AFS was $154 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, there was an additional $11 million decrease in the ACL during the year ended December 31, 2020 in connection with the disposition of MetLife Seguros de Retiro.\nSee Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on new credit loss guidance adopted on January 1, 2020 affecting the credit loss evaluation process and the measurement of credit loss; and a summary of the similarities and the differences of this new credit loss guidance with the previous guidance.\nFuture Credit Losses\nProvisions for credit loss recognized in future quarters on fixed maturity securities AFS will depend primarily on future economic fundamentals, issuer performance (including changes in the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected), changes in credit ratings and collateral valuation. In upcoming periods, if there are changes in the above factors, provisions for credit loss may be recorded, as well as changes in the ACL on securities for which a provision for credit loss was previously recorded.\nContractholder-Directed Equity Securities and Fair Value Option Securities\nThe estimated fair value of these investments, which are primarily comprised of Unit-linked investments, was $13.3 billion and $13.1 billion, or 2.5% and 2.7% of cash and invested assets, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Notes 1 and 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of this portfolio, its fair value hierarchy and a rollforward of the fair value measurements for these investments measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic initially caused volatility in the equity markets and widening of credit spreads decreasing the estimated fair value of our Unit-linked investments and FVO Securities. However, during the fourth quarter of 2020, equity markets increased and credit spreads tightened. As a result, the estimated fair value of these securities still held at year end increased, resulting in a mark-to-market gain of $\n489\nmillion in net investment income, as the change in estimated fair value on these securities is recorded in net investment income.\nSecurities Lending, Repurchase Agreements and FHLB of Boston Advance Agreements\nWe participate in a securities lending program whereby securities are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. We also participate in short-term repurchase agreement transactions with unaffiliated financial institutions. In addition, a subsidiary of the Company has entered into short-term advance agreements with the FHLB of Boston. See\n“— Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Liquidity and Capital Uses — Securities Lending and Repurchase Agreements”\nand Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n102\nMortgage Loans\nOur mortgage loans held-for-investment are principally collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential properties. Mortgage loans held-for-investment are carried at amortized cost and the related ACL are summarized as follows at:\nThe carrying value of all mortgage loans, net of ACL, was 15.9% and 16.4% of cash and invested assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loan portfolios are subject to uncertain market conditions, including the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic. As a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we granted concessions (e.g., payment deferrals and other loan modifications) to certain of our commercial mortgage loan borrowers (principally in the hotel and retail sectors) and residential mortgage loan borrowers and, to a much lesser extent, some of our agricultural mortgage loan borrowers. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding COVID-19 Pandemic-related mortgage loan concessions. See also “— Commercial Mortgage Loans by Geographic Region and Property Type.”\nWe diversify our mortgage loan portfolio by both geographic region and property type to reduce the risk of concentration. Of our commercial and agricultural mortgage loan held-for-investment portfolios, 83% are collateralized by properties located in the United States, with the remaining 17% collateralized by properties located outside the United States, which includes 4% of properties located in the U.K. and 4% of properties located in Mexico, at December 31, 2020. The carrying values of our commercial and agricultural mortgage loans held-for-investment located in California, New York and Texas were 17%, 10% and 7%, respectively, of total commercial and agricultural mortgage loans held-for-investment at December 31, 2020. Additionally, we manage risk when originating commercial and agricultural mortgage loans by generally lending up to 75% of the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate collateral.\nWe manage our residential mortgage loan held-for-investment portfolio in a similar manner to reduce risk of concentration, with 92% collateralized by properties located in the United States, and the remaining 8% collateralized by properties located outside the United States, principally in Chile, at December 31, 2020. The carrying values of our residential mortgage loans located in California, Florida, and New York were 33%, 9%, and 7%, respectively, of total residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2020.\n103\nCommercial Mortgage Loans by Geographic Region and Property Type\n. Commercial mortgage loans are the largest component of the mortgage loan invested asset class. The tables below present the diversification across geographic regions and property types of commercial mortgage loans held-for-investment at:\n__________________\nOur commercial mortgage loan portfolio is well positioned with exposures concentrated in high quality underlying properties located in primary markets typically with institutional investors who are better positioned to manage their assets during periods of market volatility. Our portfolio is comprised primarily of lower risk loans with higher debt-service coverage ratios (“DSCR”) and lower loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios. See “\n—\nMortgage Loan Credit Quality\n—\nMonitoring Process” for further information and Note\n8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a distribution of our commercial mortgage loans by DSCR and LTV ratios. Excluding loans with a COVID-19 Pandemic-related payment deferral, over 99% of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio was current and 100% of our hotel and retail commercial mortgage loan portfolio was current at December 31, 2020. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding COVID-19 Pandemic-related mortgage loan concessions.\nMortgage Loan Credit Quality — Monitoring Process\n. We monitor our mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis, including a review of loans by credit quality indicator and loans that are current, past due, restructured and under foreclosure. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding mortgage loans by credit quality indicator, past due and nonaccrual mortgage loans.\n104\nWe review our commercial mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. These reviews may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, LTV ratios, DSCR and tenant creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans, which include those that are classified as restructured, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher LTV ratios and lower DSCR and loans with a COVID-19 Pandemic-related payment deferral. The monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loans is generally similar, with a focus on higher risk loans, such as loans with higher LTV ratios. Agricultural mortgage loans are reviewed on an ongoing basis which include, but are not limited to, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, LTV ratios and borrower creditworthiness, including reviews on a geographic and property-type basis. We review our residential mortgage loans on an ongoing basis, with a focus on higher risk loans, such as nonperforming loans. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our evaluation of residential mortgage loans and related ACL methodology.\nLTV ratios and DSCR are common measures in the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loans. LTV ratios are a common measure in the assessment of the quality of agricultural mortgage loans. LTV ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. A LTV ratio greater than 100% indicates that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value. A LTV ratio of less than 100% indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount. Generally, the higher the LTV ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. The DSCR compares a property’s net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan. Generally, the lower the DSCR, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. For our commercial mortgage loans, our average LTV ratio was 58% and 55% at December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively, and our average DSCR was 2.5x and 2.4x at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The DSCR and the values utilized in calculating the ratio are updated routinely. In addition, the LTV ratio is routinely updated for all but the lowest risk loans as part of our ongoing review of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. For our agricultural mortgage loans, our average LTV ratio was 48% and 47% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The values utilized in calculating our agricultural mortgage loan LTV ratio are developed in connection with the ongoing review of our agricultural loan portfolio and are routinely updated.\nMortgage Loan Allowance for Credit Loss.\nOur ACL is established for both pools of loans with similar risk characteristics and for mortgage loans with dissimilar risk characteristics, collateral dependent loans and reasonably expected troubled debt restructurings, individually on a loan specific basis. We record an allowance for expected lifetime credit loss in an amount that represents the portion of the amortized cost basis of mortgage loans that the Company does not expect to collect, resulting in mortgage loans being presented at the net amount expected to be collected.\nIn determining our ACL, management (i) pools mortgage loans that share similar risk characteristics, (ii) considers expected lifetime credit loss over the contractual term of our mortgage loans, as adjusted for expected prepayments and any extensions, and (iii) considers past events and current and forecasted economic conditions. Actual credit loss realized could be different from the amount of the ACL recorded. These evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available, which can cause the ACL to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised. Negative credit migration, including an actual or expected increase in the level of problem loans, will result in an increase in the ACL. Positive credit migration, including an actual or expected decrease in the level of problem loans, will result in a decrease in the ACL. See Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on how the ACL is established and monitored, and activity in and balances of the ACL, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nSee Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the new credit loss guidance adopted in 2020 affecting the credit loss evaluation process and the measurement of credit loss effective January 1, 2020, as well as a summary of the similarities and the differences of this new credit loss guidance with the previous guidance.\nReal Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures\nReal estate and real estate joint ventures is comprised of wholly-owned real estate and joint ventures with interests in single property income-producing real estate and, to a lesser extent, joint ventures with interests in multi-property projects with varying strategies ranging from the development of properties to the operation of income-producing properties, as well as a runoff portfolio. The carrying value of real estate and real estate joint ventures was $11.9 billion and $10.7 billion, or 2.3%\nand 2.2% of cash and invested assets, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n105\nAs a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, certain of our real estate investments, principally hotel properties, experienced a reduction in income during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe lease investment real estate, principally commercial real estate, for office and retail use, through a variety of operating lease arrangements. In response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, during the\nyear ended December 31, 2020\n, we granted lease concessions (e.g., rent payment deferrals) to some of our lessees. In addition, we have interests in certain unconsolidated real estate joint ventures which have granted COVID-19 Pandemic-related lease concessions. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding COVID-19 Pandemic-related lease concessions.\nOur real estate investments are typically stabilized properties that we intend to hold for the longer-term for portfolio diversification and long-term appreciation. Our real estate investment portfolio has significantly appreciated since acquisition to a $6.3 billion unrealized gain position at December 31, 2020 that is available to absorb valuation declines from the current economic conditions. We continuously monitor expected future cash flows of our real estate investments and incorporate them into our periodic impairment analyses. As a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, we performed impairment analyses during the year ended December 31, 2020, which included updated estimates of expected future cash flows. As a result of our impairment analyses, we recorded one impairment during the year ended December 31, 2020 for $13 million. This impairment was recorded in net investment income as the investment is in a real estate fund that is accounted for under the equity method. There were no impairments recognized in net investment gains (losses) on real estate and real estate joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2020. There were\n$10 million\nin impairments recognized for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe diversify our real estate investments by both geographic region and property type to reduce risk of concentration. See Note\n8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of real estate investments, by income type, as well as income earned\n.\nGeographical diversification: Of our real estate investments, excluding funds, 60% were located in the United States, with the remaining 40% located outside the United States, at December 31, 2020. The carrying value of our real estate investments, excluding funds, located in Japan, California and Washington, D.C. were 35%, 10% and 9%, respectively, of total real estate investments, excluding funds, at December 31, 2020. Real estate funds were 25% of our real estate investments at December 31, 2020. The majority of these funds hold underlying real estate investments that are well diversified across the United States.\nProperty type diversification: Real estate and real estate joint venture investments are categorized by property type as follows at:\n106\nOther Limited Partnership Interests\nOther limited partnership interests are comprised of investments in private funds, including private equity funds and hedge funds. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value of other limited partnership interests wa\ns $9.5 billion\nand $7.7 billion, which included\n$643 million\nand $575 million of hedge funds, respectively. Other limited partnership interests we\nre 1.79%\nand 1.57% of cash and invested assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash distributions on these investments are generated from investment gains, operating income from the underlying investments of the funds and liquidation of the underlying investments of the funds.\nWe use the equity method of accounting for most of our private equity funds. We generally recognize our share of a private equity fund’s earnings in net investment income on a three-month lag when the information is reported to us. Accordingly, declines in the equity markets, which can impact the underlying results of these private equity funds, are recorded in our net investment income on a three-month lag.\nAs a result of declines in the equity market in the first quarter of 2020, which were reported to us in the second quarter of 2020 by our investees, we recorded negative net investment income of $607 million on our private equity and hedge fund investments during the three months ended June 30, 2020. As a result of increases in the equity market in the second quarter of 2020, which were reported to us in the third quarter of 2020 by our investees, we recorded net investment income of $578 million on our private equity and hedge fund investments during the three months ended September 30, 2020. As a result of increases in the equity market in the third quarter of 2020, which were reported to us in the fourth quarter of 2020 by our investees, we recorded net investment income of $709 million on our private equity and hedge fund investments during the three months ended December 31, 2020. For a discussion of our expected private equity returns in 2021\n, see “— Executive Summary — Consolidated Company Outlook.”\nOther Invested Assets\nThe following table presents the carrying value of our other invested assets by type at:\nOur direct financing and leveraged lease portfolios are subject to uncertain market conditions, including the effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and related economic slowdown. In response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we granted lease concessions, primarily in the form of rent deferrals, to some of our lessees. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding COVID-19 Pandemic-related direct financing lease concessions.\nSee Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the new credit loss guidance adopted in 2020 affecting the credit loss evaluation process and the measurement of credit loss, including direct financing and leveraged leases effective January 1, 2020.\nSee Notes 1, 8 and 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values, tax credit and renewable energy partnerships, direct financing and leveraged leases, annuities funding structured settlement claims, FHLB common stock, operating joint ventures and funds withheld, as well as, gains (losses) on disposals of, and impairments of, tax credit and renewable energy partnerships, and leveraged lease impairment losses.\n107\nDerivatives\nDerivative Risks\nWe are exposed to various risks relating to our ongoing business operations, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and equity market. We use a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for:\n•\nA comprehensive description of the nature of our derivatives, including the strategies for which derivatives are used in managing various risks.\n•\nInformation about the primary underlying risk exposure, gross notional amount, and estimated fair value of our derivatives by type of hedge designation, excluding embedded derivatives held at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n•\nThe statement of operations effects of derivatives in net investments in foreign operations, cash flow, fair value, or nonqualifying hedge relationships for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nSee “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Management of Market Risk Exposures — Hedging Activities” for more information about our use of derivatives by major hedge program.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy.\nThe valuation of Level 3 derivatives involves the use of significant unobservable inputs and generally requires a higher degree of management judgment or estimation than the valuations of Level 1 and Level 2 derivatives. Although Level 3 inputs are unobservable, management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments and are considered appropriate given the circumstances. The use of different inputs or methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of Level 3 derivatives and could materially affect net income.\nDerivatives categorized as Level 3 at December 31, 2020 include: interest rate forwards with maturities which extend beyond the observable portion of the yield curve; interest rate total return swaps with unobservable repurchase rates; foreign currency swaps and forwards with certain unobservable inputs, including the unobservable portion of the yield curve; credit default swaps priced using unobservable credit spreads, or that are priced through independent broker quotations; equity variance swaps with unobservable volatility inputs; and equity index options with unobservable correlation inputs. At December 31, 2020, less than 1% of the estimated fair value of our derivatives was priced through independent broker quotations.\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a rollforward of the fair value measurements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\nThe gain (loss) on Level 3 derivatives primarily relates to foreign currency derivatives and interest rate forwards that are valued using an unobservable portion of the swap yield curves and unobservable interest rates, respectively. Other significant inputs, which are observable, include equity volatility and observable interest rates. We validate the reasonableness of these inputs by valuing the positions using internal models and comparing the results to broker quotations.\nThe gain (loss) on Level 3 derivatives, percentage of gain (loss) attributable to observable and unobservable inputs, and the primary drivers of observable gain (loss) are summarized as follows:\nSee “— Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Derivatives” for further information on the estimates and assumptions that affect derivatives.\n108\nCredit Risk\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about how we manage credit risk related to derivatives and for the estimated fair value of our net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities after the application of master netting agreements and collateral.\nOur policy is not to offset the fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement. This policy applies to the recognition of derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets and does not affect our legal right of offset.\nCredit Derivatives\nThe following table presents the gross notional amount and estimated fair value of credit default swaps at:\nThe following table presents the gross gains, gross losses and net gains (losses) recognized in net derivative gains (losses) for credit default swaps as follows:\n__________________\n(1)\nGains (losses) do not include earned income (expense) on credit default swaps.\nThe unfavorable change in net gains (losses) on written credit default swaps was $354 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to certain credit spreads on certain credit default swaps used as replications widening in the current period and narrowing in the prior period.\nThe maximum amount at risk related to our written credit default swaps is equal to the corresponding gross notional amount. In a replication transaction, we pair an asset on our balance sheet with a written credit default swap to synthetically replicate a corporate bond, a core asset holding of life insurance companies. Replications are entered into in accordance with the guidelines approved by state insurance regulators and the NAIC and are an important tool in managing the overall corporate credit risk within the Company. In order to match our long-dated insurance liabilities, we seek to buy long-dated corporate bonds. In some instances, these may not be readily available in the market, or they may be issued by corporations to which we already have significant corporate credit exposure. For example, by purchasing Treasury bonds (or other high quality assets) and associating them with written credit default swaps on the desired corporate credit name, we can replicate the desired bond exposures and meet our ALM needs. In addition, given the shorter tenor of the credit default swaps (generally five-year tenors) versus a long-dated corporate bond, we have more flexibility in managing our credit exposures.\nEmbedded Derivatives\nSee Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy and a rollforward of the fair value measurements for embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\n109\nSee Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the nonperformance risk adjustment included in the valuation of guaranteed minimum benefits accounted for as embedded derivatives.\nSee “— Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Derivatives” for further information on the estimates and assumptions that affect embedded derivatives.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCredit and Committed Facilities\nWe maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility, as well as certain committed facilities (“Committed Facilities”), with various financial institutions. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for descriptions of such arrangements, the classification of expenses on such credit and committed facilities and the nature of the associated liability for letters of credit issued and drawdowns on these credit and committed facilities. See also “— Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources — Global Funding Sources — Credit and Committed Facilities.”\nCollateral for Securities Lending, Repurchase Agreements, Third-Party Custodian Administered Repurchase Programs and Derivatives\nWe participate in securities lending transactions, repurchase agreements and third-party custodian administered repurchase programs in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio. See Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements, the classification of revenues and expenses, and the nature of the secured financing arrangements and associated liabilities.\nSecurities lending and repurchase agreements: Periodically we receive non-cash collateral for securities lending and repurchase agreements from counterparties, which is not reflected on our consolidated financial statements. The amount of this non-cash collateral was $1 million and $0 at estimated fair value at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThird-party custodian administered repurchase programs: We loan certain of our fixed maturity securities AFS to unaffiliated financial institutions and, in exchange, non-cash collateral is put on deposit by the unaffiliated financial institutions on our behalf with third-party custodians. The estimated fair value of securities loaned in connection with these transactions was\n$19 million\nand $85 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Non-cash collateral on deposit with third-party custodians on our behalf was\n$20 million\nand $90 million, at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which cannot be sold or re-pledged, and which is not reflected on our consolidated financial statements.\nDerivatives: We enter into derivatives to manage various risks relating to our ongoing business operations. We receive non-cash collateral from counterparties for derivatives, which can be sold or re-pledged subject to certain constraints, and which is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of this non-cash collateral was $1.7 billion at estimated fair value, at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. See “— Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Liquidity and Capital Uses — Pledged Collateral” and Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the earned income on and the gross notional amount, estimated fair value of assets and liabilities and primary underlying risk exposure of our derivatives.\nInvestment Commitments\nWe enter into the following commitments in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio: mortgage loan commitments and commitments to fund partnerships, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about these investment commitments. See “Net Investment Income” and “Net Investment Gains (Losses)” in Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the investment income, investment expense, gains and losses from such investments and the liability for credit loss for unfunded mortgage loan commitments. See also “— Investments — Fixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity Securities,” “— Investments — Mortgage Loans,” “— Investments — Real Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures” and “— Investments — Other Limited Partnership Interests.”\nLease Commitments\nAs lessee, we have entered into various lease and sublease agreements for office space and equipment. Our commitments under such lease agreements are included within the contractual obligations table. See “— Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Contractual Obligations” and Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n110\nGuarantees\nSee “Guarantees” in Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInsolvency Assessments\nSee Note 21\nof the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPolicyholder Liabilities\nWe establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations or to provide for future annuity payments. Amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported on the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. For more details on Policyholder Liabilities, see “— Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates.”\nDue to the nature of the underlying risks and the uncertainty associated with the determination of actuarial liabilities, we cannot precisely determine the amounts that will ultimately be paid with respect to these actuarial liabilities, and the ultimate amounts may vary from the estimated amounts, particularly when payments may not occur until well into the future.\nWe periodically review our estimates of actuarial liabilities for future benefits and compare them with our actual experience. We revise estimates, to the extent permitted or required under GAAP, if we determine that future expected experience differs from assumptions used in the development of actuarial liabilities. We charge or credit changes in our liabilities to expenses in the period the liabilities are established or re-estimated. If the liabilities originally established for future benefit payments prove inadequate, we must increase them. Such an increase could adversely affect our earnings and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have experienced, and will likely in the future experience, catastrophe losses and possibly acts of terrorism, as well as turbulent financial markets that may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to their nature, we cannot predict the incidence, timing, severity or amount of losses from catastrophes and acts of terrorism, but we make broad use of catastrophic and non-catastrophic reinsurance to manage risk from these perils. We also use hedging, reinsurance and other risk management activities to mitigate financial market volatility.\nSee “Business — Regulation — Insurance Regulation — Policy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis” for further information regarding required analyses of the adequacy of statutory reserves of our insurance operations.\nFuture Policy Benefits\nWe establish liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies. See Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. See also “— Industry Trends — Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment — Low Interest Rate Scenarios” and “— Variable Annuity Guarantees.” A discussion of future policy benefits by segment (as well as Corporate & Other) follows.\nU.S.\nAmounts payable under insurance policies for this segment are comprised of group insurance and annuities. For group insurance, future policyholder benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under disability waiver of premium policy provisions, liabilities for survivor income benefit insurance, active life policies and premium stabilization and other contingency liabilities held under life insurance contracts. For group annuity contracts, future policyholder benefits are primarily related to payout annuities, including pension risk transfers, structured settlement annuities and institutional income annuities. There is no interest rate crediting flexibility on these liabilities. As a result, a sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings; however, we mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies, including the use of various interest rate derivative positions.\nAsia\nFuture policy benefits for this segment are held primarily for traditional life, endowment, annuity and accident & health contracts. They are also held for total return pass-through provisions included in certain universal life and savings products. They include certain liabilities for variable annuity and variable life guarantees of minimum death benefits, and longevity guarantees. Factors impacting these liabilities include sustained periods of lower than expected yields, lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, market volatility, actual lapses resulting in lower than expected income, and actual mortality or morbidity resulting in higher than expected benefit payments. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies and by the use of reinsurance.\n111\nLatin America\nFuture policy benefit liabilities for this segment are held primarily for immediate annuities, traditional life contracts and total return pass-through provisions included in certain universal life and savings products. There is limited interest rate crediting flexibility on the immediate annuity and traditional life liabilities. As a result, sustained periods of lower than expected yields could negatively impact earnings; however, we mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies. Other factors impacting these liabilities are actual mortality resulting in higher than expected benefit payments and actual lapses resulting in lower than expected income.\nEMEA\nFuture policy benefits for this segment include unearned premium reserves for group life and medical and credit insurance contracts. Future policy benefits are also held for traditional life, endowment and annuity contracts with significant mortality risk and accident & health contracts. Factors impacting these liabilities include lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, market volatility, actual lapses resulting in lower than expected income, and actual mortality or morbidity resulting in higher than expected benefit payments. We mitigate our risks by having premiums which are adjustable or cancellable in some cases, applying various ALM strategies and by the use of reinsurance.\nMetLife Holdings\nFuture policy benefits for the life insurance business are comprised mainly of liabilities for traditional life insurance contracts. In order to manage risk, we have often reinsured a portion of the mortality risk on life insurance policies. We routinely evaluate our reinsurance programs, which may result in increases or decreases to existing coverage. We have entered into various interest rate derivative positions to mitigate the risk that investment of premiums received and reinvestment of maturing assets over the life of the policy will be at rates below those assumed in the original pricing of these contracts. For the annuities business, future policy benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for life-contingent income annuities and liabilities for the variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits that are accounted for as insurance. For the long-term care business, future policyholder benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under disability waiver of premium policy provisions, and active life policies. In addition, for our other products, future policyholder benefits related to the reinsurance of our former Japan joint venture are comprised of liabilities for the variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits that are accounted for as insurance.\nCorporate & Other\nFuture policy benefits primarily include liabilities for other reinsurance business.\nPolicyholder Account Balances\nPolicyholder account balances are generally equal to the account value, which includes accrued interest credited, but excludes the impact of any applicable charge that may be incurred upon surrender. See “— Industry Trends — Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment — Low Interest Rate Scenarios” and “— Variable Annuity Guarantees.” See also Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. A discussion of policyholder account balances by segment follows.\nU.S.\nPolicyholder account balances in this segment are comprised of funding agreements, retained asset accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life insurance policies and specialized life insurance products for benefit programs.\nGroup Benefits\nPolicyholder account balances in this business are held for retained asset accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life insurance policies and specialized life insurance products for benefit programs. Policyholder account balances are credited interest at a rate we determine, which is influenced by current market rates. A sustained low interest rate environment could adversely impact liabilities and earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in most of these policyholder account balances. We have various interest rate derivative positions to partially mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario.\n112\nThe table below presents the breakdown of account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates for Group Benefits:\nRetirement and Income Solutions\nPolicyholder account balances in this business are held largely for investment-type products, mainly funding agreements, as well as postretirement benefits and corporate-owned life insurance to fund non-qualified benefit programs for executives. Interest crediting rates vary by type of contract and can be fixed or variable. Variable interest crediting rates are generally tied to an external index, most commonly (1-month or 3-month) LIBOR or Secured Overnight Financing Rate. We are exposed to interest rate risks, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk, when guaranteeing payment of interest and return of principal at the contractual maturity date. We may invest in floating rate assets or enter into receive-floating interest rate swaps, also tied to external indices, as well as interest rate caps, to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates. We also mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies and seek to hedge all foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of foreign currency hedges, including cross currency swaps.\nThe table below presents the breakdown of account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates for RIS:\nAsia\nPolicyholder account balances in this segment are held largely for fixed income retirement and savings plans, fixed deferred annuities, interest sensitive whole life products, universal life and, to a lesser degree, liability amounts for Unit-linked investments that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. Also included are certain liabilities for retirement and savings products sold in certain countries in Asia that generally are sold with minimum credited rate guarantees. Liabilities for guarantees on certain variable annuities in Asia are accounted for as embedded derivatives and recorded at estimated fair value and are also included within policyholder account balances. A sustained low interest rate environment could adversely impact liabilities and earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in most of these policyholder account balances. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies and with reinsurance. Liabilities for Unit-linked investments are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated underlying investments, as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder.\n113\nThe table below presents the breakdown of account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates for Asia:\nLatin America\nPolicyholder account balances in this segment are held largely for investment-type products, universal life products, deferred annuities and Unit-linked investments that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. Liabilities for Unit-linked investments are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated investments, as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder. Many of the other liabilities have minimum credited rate guarantees, which could adversely impact liabilities and earnings in a sustained low interest rate environment. We mitigate our risk by applying various ALM strategies.\nEMEA\nPolicyholder account balances in this segment are held mostly for universal life, deferred annuities, pension products, and Unit-linked investments that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. They are also held for endowment products without significant mortality risk. A sustained low interest rate environment could adversely impact liabilities and earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in many of these policyholder account balances. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies. Liabilities for Unit-linked investments are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated investments, as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder.\nMetLife Holdings\nLife policyholder account balances in this segment are held for retained asset accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life insurance policies, and funding agreements. For annuities, policyholder account balances are held for fixed deferred annuities, the fixed account portion of variable annuities, non-life contingent income annuities, and embedded derivatives related to variable annuity guarantees. Interest is credited to the policyholder’s account at interest rates we determine which are influenced by current market rates, subject to specified minimums. A sustained low interest rate environment could adversely impact liabilities and earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in most of these policyholder account balances. We have various interest rate derivative positions to partially mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario. Additionally, for our other products, policyholder account balances are held for variable annuity guarantees assumed from a former operating joint venture in Japan that are accounted for as embedded derivatives.\nThe table below presents the breakdown of account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates for the MetLife Holdings segment:\n114\nVariable Annuity Guarantees\nWe issue, directly and through assumed business, certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits that provide the policyholder a minimum return based on their initial deposit (i.e., the benefit base) less withdrawals. In some cases, the benefit base may be increased by additional deposits, bonus amounts, accruals or optional market value resets. See Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCertain guarantees, including portions thereof, have insurance liabilities established that are included in future policy benefits. Guarantees accounted for in this manner include GMDBs, the life-contingent portion of GMWBs, elective GMIB annuitizations, and the life contingent portion of GMIBs that require annuitization when the account balance goes to zero. These liabilities are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to actual and future expected policy assessments based on the level of guaranteed minimum benefits generated using multiple scenarios of separate account returns. The scenarios are based on best estimate assumptions consistent with those used to amortize DAC. When current estimates of future benefits exceed those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments are lower than those previously projected, liabilities will increase, resulting in a current period charge to net income. The opposite result occurs when the current estimates of future benefits are lower than those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments exceed those previously projected. At the end of each reporting period, we update the actual amount of business remaining in-force, which impacts expected future assessments and the projection of estimated future benefits resulting in a current period charge or increase to earnings.\nCertain guarantees, including portions thereof, accounted for as embedded derivatives, are recorded at estimated fair value and included in policyholder account balances. Guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives include GMABs, the non-life contingent portion of GMWBs and certain non-life contingent portions of GMIBs. The estimated fair values of guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions, including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk-neutral valuation methodology is used to project the cash flows from the guarantees under multiple capital market scenarios to determine an economic liability. The reported estimated fair value is then determined by taking the present value of these risk-free generated cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates a spread over the risk-free rate to reflect our nonperformance risk and adding a risk margin. For more information on the determination of estimated fair value, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe table below presents the carrying value for guarantees at:\n115\nThe carrying amounts for guarantees included in policyholder account balances above include nonperformance risk adjustments of $137 million and $147 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These nonperformance risk adjustments represent the impact of including a credit spread when discounting the underlying risk neutral cash flows to determine the estimated fair values. The nonperformance risk adjustment does not have an economic impact on us as it cannot be monetized given the nature of these policyholder liabilities. The change in valuation arising from the nonperformance risk adjustment is not hedged.\nThe carrying values of these guarantees can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance, equity volatility, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. Carrying values are also impacted by our assumptions around mortality, separate account returns and policyholder behavior, including lapse rates.\nAs discussed below, we use a combination of product design, hedging strategies, reinsurance, and other risk management actions to mitigate the risks related to these benefits. Within each type of guarantee, there is a range of product offerings reflecting the changing nature of these products over time. Changes in product features and terms are in part driven by customer demand but, more importantly, reflect our risk management practices of continuously evaluating the guaranteed benefits and their associated asset-liability matching. We continue to diversify the concentration of income benefits in our portfolio by focusing on withdrawal benefits, variable annuities without living benefits and index-linked annuities.\nThe sections below provide further detail by total account value for certain of our most popular guarantees. Total account values include amounts not reported on the consolidated balance sheets from assumed business, Unit-linked investments that do not qualify for presentation as separate account assets, and amounts included in our general account. The total account values and the net amounts at risk include direct and assumed business, but exclude offsets from hedging or ceded reinsurance, if any.\nGMDBs\nWe offer a range of GMDBs to our contractholders. The table below presents GMDBs, by benefit type, at December 31, 2020:\n__________________\n(1)\nTotal account value excludes $603 million for contracts with no GMDBs. The Company’s annuity contracts with guarantees may offer more than one type of guarantee in each contract. Therefore, the amounts listed for GMDBs and for living benefit guarantees are not mutually exclusive.\nBased on total account value, less than 18% of our GMDBs included enhanced death benefits such as the annual step-up or roll-up and step-up combination products at December 31, 2020.\n116\nLiving Benefit Guarantees\nThe table below presents our living benefit guarantees based on total account values at December 31, 2020:\n__________________\n(1)\nTotal account value excludes $26.0 billion for contracts with no living benefit guarantees. The Company’s annuity contracts with guarantees may offer more than one type of guarantee in each contract. Therefore, the amounts listed for GMDBs and for living benefit guarantee amounts are not mutually exclusive.\n(2)\nThe Asia and EMEA segments include the non-life contingent portion of the GMWB total account value of $1.2 billion with a guarantee at annuitization.\nIn terms of total account value, GMIBs are our most significant living benefit guarantee. Our primary risk management strategy for our GMIB products is our derivatives hedging program as discussed below. Additionally, we have engaged in certain reinsurance agreements covering some of our GMIB business. As part of our overall risk management approach for living benefit guarantees, we continually monitor the reinsurance markets for the right opportunity to purchase additional coverage for our GMIB business. We stopped selling GMIBs in February 2016.\nThe table below presents our GMIB associated total account values, by their guaranteed payout basis, at December 31, 2020:\nThe annuitization interest rates on GMIBs have been decreased from 2.5% to 0.5% over time, partially in response to the low interest rate environment, accompanied by an increase in the setback period from seven years to 10 years and the introduction of a 10-year mortality projection.\nAdditionally, 40% of the $21.2 billion of GMIB total account value has been invested in managed volatility funds as of December 31, 2020. These funds seek to manage volatility by adjusting the fund holdings within certain guidelines based on capital market movements. Such activity reduces the overall risk of the underlying funds while maintaining their growth opportunities. These risk mitigation techniques reduce or eliminate the need for us to manage the funds’ volatility through hedging or reinsurance.\nOur GMIB products typically have a waiting period of 10 years to be eligible for annuitization. As of December 31, 2020, only 26% of our contracts with GMIBs were eligible for annuitization. The remaining contracts are not eligible for annuitization for an average of three years.\n117\nOnce eligible for annuitization, contractholders would be expected to annuitize only if their contracts were in-the-money. We calculate in-the-moneyness with respect to GMIBs consistent with net amount at risk as discussed in Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, by comparing the contractholders’ income benefits based on total account values and current annuity rates versus the guaranteed income benefits. The net amount at risk was $614 million at December 31, 2020, of which $552 million was related to GMIBs. For those contracts with GMIB, the table below presents details of contracts that are in-the-money and out-of-the-money at December 31, 2020:\nDerivatives Hedging Variable Annuity Guarantees\nOur risk mitigating hedging strategy uses various OTC and exchange traded derivatives. The table below presents the gross notional amount, estimated fair value and primary underlying risk exposure of the derivatives hedging our variable annuity guarantees:\nThe change in estimated fair values of our derivatives is recorded in policyholder benefits and claims if such derivatives are hedging guarantees included in future policy benefits, and in net derivative gains (losses) if such derivatives are hedging guarantees included in policyholder account balances.\nOur hedging strategy involves the significant use of static longer-term derivative instruments to avoid the need to execute transactions during periods of market disruption or higher volatility. We continually monitor the capital markets for opportunities to adjust our liability coverage, as appropriate. Futures are also used to dynamically adjust the daily coverage levels as markets and liability exposures fluctuate.\n118\nWe remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. Certain of our reinsurance agreements and all derivative positions are collateralized and derivatives positions are subject to master netting agreements, both of which significantly reduce the exposure to counterparty risk. In addition, we are subject to the risk that hedging and other risk management actions prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors. Changing conditions in the global capital markets and the economy may affect our financing costs and market interest for our debt or equity securities. For further information regarding market factors that could affect our ability to meet liquidity and capital needs, see “— Industry Trends” and “— Investments — Current Environment.”\nLiquidity Management\nBased upon the strength of our franchise, diversification of our businesses, strong financial fundamentals and the substantial funding sources available to us as described herein, we continue to believe we have access to ample liquidity to meet business requirements under current market conditions and reasonably possible stress scenarios. We continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital plans for MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries in light of market conditions, as well as changing needs and opportunities.\nShort-term Liquidity\nWe maintain a substantial short-term liquidity position, which was $9.4 billion and $9.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Short-term liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed, including amounts received in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.\nLiquid Assets\nAn integral part of our liquidity management includes managing our level of liquid assets, which was $235.1 billion and $221.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded securities, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, regulatory deposits, the collateral financing arrangement, funding agreements and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.\nCapital Management\nWe have established several senior management committees as part of our capital management process. These committees, including the Capital Management Committee and the Enterprise Risk Committee (“ERC”), regularly review actual and projected capital levels (under a variety of scenarios including stress scenarios) and our annual capital plan in accordance with our capital policy. The Capital Management Committee is comprised of members of senior management, including MetLife, Inc.’s Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), Treasurer, and Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”). The ERC is also comprised of members of senior management, including MetLife, Inc.’s CFO, CRO and Chief Investment Officer.\nOur Board of Directors and senior management are directly involved in the development and maintenance of our capital policy. The capital policy sets forth, among other things, minimum and target capital levels and the governance of the capital management process. All capital actions, including proposed changes to the annual capital plan, capital targets or capital policy, are reviewed by the Finance and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors prior to obtaining full Board of Directors approval. The Board of Directors approves the capital policy and the annual capital plan and authorizes capital actions, as required.\nSee “Risk Factors — Capital Risks — We May not be Able to Pay Dividends or Repurchase Our Stock Due to Legal and Regulatory Restrictions or Cash Buffer Needs” for information regarding restrictions on payment of dividends and stock repurchases. See also Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding MetLife, Inc.’s common stock repurchase authorizations.\n119\nThe Company\nLiquidity\nLiquidity refers to the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs. We determine our liquidity needs based on a rolling 12-month forecast by portfolio of invested assets which we monitor daily. We adjust the asset mix and asset maturities based on this rolling 12-month forecast. To support this forecast, we conduct cash flow and stress testing, which include various scenarios of the potential risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. We include provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many of our products, including general account pension products sold to employee benefit plan sponsors. Certain of these provisions prevent the customer from making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product. In the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated liquidity needs, we have various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need. These available alternatives include cash flows from operations, sales of liquid assets, global funding sources including commercial paper and various credit and committed facilities.\nUnder certain stressful market and economic conditions, our access to liquidity may deteriorate, or the cost to access liquidity may increase. A downgrade in our credit or financial strength ratings could also negatively affect our liquidity. See “— Rating Agencies.” If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements or if we are required to post or return cash collateral in connection with derivatives or our securities lending program, we may have difficulty selling investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both. In addition, in the event of such forced sale, for securities in an unrealized loss position, realized losses would be incurred on securities sold and impairments would be incurred, if there is a need to sell securities prior to recovery, which may negatively impact our financial condition. See “Risk Factors — Investment Risks — We May Have Difficulty Selling Holdings in Our Investment Portfolio or in Our Securities Lending Program in a Timely Manner to Realize Their Full Value.”\nAll general account assets within a particular legal entity — other than those which may have been pledged to a specific purpose — are generally available to fund obligations of the general account of that legal entity.\nCapital\nWe manage our capital position to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings. See “— Rating Agencies” for information regarding such ratings. Our capital position is supported by our ability to generate strong cash flows within our operating companies and borrow funds at competitive rates, as well as by our demonstrated ability to raise additional capital to meet operating and growth needs despite adverse market and economic conditions.\nStatutory Capital and Dividends\nOur U.S. insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus well above levels to meet current regulatory requirements.\nRBC requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the NAIC and the state insurance departments to identify companies that merit regulatory action. RBC is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and statutory reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, market risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis. The formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. These rules apply to most of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. State insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels. As of the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the total adjusted capital of each of these subsidiaries subject to these requirements was in excess of each of those RBC levels.\nAs a Delaware corporation, American Life is subject to Delaware law; however, because it does not conduct insurance business in Delaware or any other U.S. state, it is exempt from RBC requirements under Delaware law. American Life’s operations are also regulated by applicable authorities of the jurisdictions in which it operates and is subject to capital and solvency requirements in those jurisdictions.\n120\nThe amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries can pay to MetLife, Inc. or to other parent entities is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings, which provides an additional margin for risk protection and investment in our businesses. We proactively take actions to maintain capital consistent with these ratings objectives, which may include adjusting dividend amounts and deploying financial resources from internal or external sources of capital. Certain of these activities may require regulatory approval. Furthermore, the payment of dividends and other distributions to MetLife, Inc. and other parent entities by their respective insurance subsidiaries is governed by insurance laws and regulations. See “Business — Regulation — Insurance Regulation,” “— MetLife, Inc. — Liquidity and Capital Sources — Dividends from Subsidiaries” and Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAffiliated Captive Reinsurance Transactions\nMLIC cedes specific policy classes, including term and universal life insurance, participating whole life insurance, LTD insurance, group life insurance and other business to various wholly-owned captive reinsurers. The reinsurance activities among these affiliated companies are eliminated within our consolidated results of operations. The statutory reserves of such affiliated captive reinsurers are supported by a combination of funds withheld assets, investment assets and letters of credit issued by unaffiliated financial institutions. MetLife, Inc. has entered into various support agreements in connection with the activities of these captive reinsurers. See Note 5 of the Notes to the MetLife, Inc. (Parent Company Only) Condensed Financial Information included in Schedule II of the Financial Statement Schedules for further details on certain of these support arrangements. MLIC has entered into reinsurance agreements with affiliated captive reinsurers for risk and capital management purposes, as well as to manage statutory reserve requirements related to universal life and term life insurance policies and other business.\nThe NYDFS continues to have a moratorium on new reserve financing transactions involving captive insurers. We are not aware of any states other than New York and California implementing such a moratorium. While such a moratorium would not impact our existing reinsurance agreements with captive reinsurers, a moratorium placed on the use of captives for new reserve financing transactions could impact our ability to write certain products and/or impact our RBC ratios and ability to deploy excess capital in the future. This could result in our need to increase prices, modify product features or limit the availability of those products to our customers. While this affects insurers across the industry, it could adversely impact our competitive position and our results of operations in the future. We continue to evaluate product modifications, pricing structure and alternative means of managing risks, capital and statutory reserves and we expect the discontinued use of captive reinsurance on new reserve financing transactions would not have a material impact on our future consolidated financial results. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our reinsurance activities.\nRating Agencies\nRating agencies assign insurer financial strength ratings to MetLife, Inc.’s U.S. life insurance subsidiaries and credit ratings to MetLife, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries. Financial strength ratings represent the opinion of rating agencies regarding the ability of an insurance company to pay obligations under insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in MetLife, Inc.’s securities. Insurer financial strength ratings are not statements of fact nor are they recommendations to purchase, hold or sell any security, contract or policy. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nRating agencies use an “outlook statement” of “positive,” “stable,” ‘‘negative’’ or “developing” to indicate a medium- or long-term trend in credit fundamentals which, if continued, may lead to a rating change. A rating may have a “stable” outlook to indicate that the rating is not expected to change; however, a “stable” rating does not preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time, without notice. Certain rating agencies assign rating modifiers such as “CreditWatch” or “under review” to indicate their opinion regarding the potential direction of a rating. These ratings modifiers are generally assigned in connection with certain events such as potential mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or material changes in a company’s results, in order for the rating agency to perform its analysis to fully determine the rating implications of the event.\n121\nOur insurer financial strength ratings at the date of this filing are indicated in the following table. Outlook is stable unless otherwise indicated. Additional information about financial strength ratings can be found on the websites of the respective rating agencies.\n__________________\nNR = Not rated\nCredit ratings indicate the rating agency’s opinion regarding a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner. They are important factors in our overall funding profile and ability to access certain types of liquidity. The level and composition of regulatory capital at the subsidiary level and our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our insurer financial strength ratings and credit ratings. Each agency has its own capital adequacy evaluation methodology, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors. In addition to heightening the level of scrutiny that they apply to insurance companies, rating agencies have increased and may continue to increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, may request additional information from the companies that they rate and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels.\nA downgrade in the credit ratings or insurer financial strength ratings of MetLife, Inc. or its subsidiaries would likely impact us in the following ways, including:\n•\nimpact our ability to generate cash flows from the sale of funding agreements and other capital market products offered by our RIS business;\n•\nimpact the cost and availability of financing for MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries; and\n•\nresult in additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements, which are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting investments held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements. See “— Liquidity and Capital Uses — Pledged Collateral.”\nSee also “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — We May Lose Business Due to a Downgrade or a Potential Downgrade in Our Financial Strength or Credit Ratings.”\n122\nSummary of the Company’s Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital\nOur primary sources and uses of liquidity and capital are summarized as follows:\nCash Flows from Operations\nThe principal cash inflows from our insurance activities come from insurance premiums, net investment income, annuity considerations and deposit funds. The principal cash outflows are the result of various life insurance, property and casualty, annuity and pension products, operating expenses and income tax, as well as interest expense. A primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash flows is the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal.\nCash Flows from Investments\nThe principal cash inflows from our investment activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and settlements of freestanding derivatives. The principal cash outflows relate to purchases of investments, issuances of policy loans and settlements of freestanding derivatives. Additional cash outflows relate to purchases of businesses. We typically have a net cash outflow from investing activities because cash inflows from insurance operations are reinvested in accordance with our ALM discipline to fund insurance liabilities. We closely monitor and manage these risks through our comprehensive investment risk management process. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors and market disruption.\n123\nCash Flows from Financing\nThe principal cash inflows from our financing activities come from issuances of debt and other securities, deposits of funds associated with policyholder account balances and lending of securities. The principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt and the collateral financing arrangement, payments of dividends on and repurchases or redemptions of MetLife, Inc.’s securities, withdrawals associated with policyholder account balances and the return of securities on loan. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are market disruption and the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal.\nLiquidity and Capital Sources\nIn addition to the general description of liquidity and capital sources in “— Summary of the Company’s Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital,” the Company’s primary sources of liquidity and capital are set forth below.\nGlobal Funding Sources\nLiquidity is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including funding agreements, credit and committed facilities and commercial paper. Capital is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including short-term and long-term debt, the collateral financing arrangement, junior subordinated debt securities, preferred securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities. MetLife, Inc. maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC that permits the issuance of public debt, equity and hybrid securities. As a “Well-Known Seasoned Issuer” under SEC rules, MetLife, Inc.’s shelf registration statement provides for automatic effectiveness upon filing and has no stated issuance capacity. The diversity of our global funding sources enhances our funding flexibility, limits dependence on any one market or source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. Our primary global funding sources include:\nPreferred Stock\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on preferred stock issuances.\nCommon Stock\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCommercial Paper, Reported in Short-term Debt\nMetLife, Inc. and MetLife Funding each have a commercial paper program that is supported by our unsecured revolving credit facility (see “— Credit and Committed Facilities”). MetLife Funding raises cash from its commercial paper program and uses the proceeds to extend loans through MetLife Credit Corp., another subsidiary of MLIC, to affiliates in order to enhance the financial flexibility and liquidity of these companies.\nFHLB Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account Balances\nCertain of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are members of a regional FHLB. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we issued $35.4 billion and $33.0 billion, respectively, and repaid $34.5 billion and $32.8 billion, respectively, of funding agreements with certain regional FHLBs. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $16.3 billion and $15.3 billion, respectively. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFHLB Advance Agreements, Reported in Payables for Collateral Under Securities Loaned and Other Transactions\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we borrowed $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, and repaid $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, under advance agreements with the FHLB of Boston. At December 31, 2020, total obligations outstanding under these advance agreements were $700 million and reported in liabilities held-for-sale. At December 31, 2019, total obligations outstanding under these advance agreements were $800 million and reported in payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the pending disposition of MetLife P&C.\n124\nSpecial Purpose Entity Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account Balances\nWe issue fixed and floating rate funding agreements which are denominated in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies, to certain unconsolidated special purpose entities that have issued either debt securities or commercial paper for which payment of interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we issued $40.4 billion and $37.3 billion, respectively, and repaid $36.7 billion and $36.4 billion, respectively, under such funding agreements. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $39.9 billion and $34.6 billion, respectively. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFederal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account Balances\nWe have issued funding agreements to a subsidiary of Farmer Mac which are secured by a pledge of certain eligible agricultural mortgage loans. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we issued $250 million and $700 million, respectively, and repaid $425 million and $700 million, respectively, under such funding agreements. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDebt Issuances\nSee “— Liquidity and Capital Uses — Debt Repurchases, Redemptions and Exchanges” and Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on senior note redemptions and issuances.\nCredit and Committed Facilities\nSee Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on credit and committed facilities.\nWe have no reason to believe that our lending counterparties will be unable to fulfill their respective contractual obligations under these facilities. As commitments under our credit and committed facilities may expire unused, these amounts do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements.\nOutstanding Debt Under Global Funding Sources\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding debt excluding long-term debt relating to CSEs at:\n__________________\n(1)\nIncludes $293 million and $136 million of debt that is non-recourse to MetLife, Inc. and MLIC, subject to customary exceptions, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Certain subsidiaries have pledged assets to secure this debt.\n(2)\nIncludes $474 million and $403 million of debt that is non-recourse to MetLife, Inc. and MLIC, subject to customary exceptions, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Certain investment subsidiaries have pledged assets to secure this debt.\nDebt and Facility Covenants\nCertain of our debt instruments and committed facilities, as well as our unsecured revolving credit facility, contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We believe we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants at December 31, 2020.\nDispositions\nFor information regarding pending and other dispositions, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n125\nLiquidity and Capital Uses\nIn addition to the general description of liquidity and capital uses in “— Summary of the Company’s Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital” and “— Contractual Obligations,” the Company’s primary uses of liquidity and capital are set forth below.\nPreferred Stock Redemption\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the partial redemption of Series C preferred stock.\nCommon Stock Repurchases\nSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to authorizations by the Board of Directors to repurchase MetLife, Inc. common stock, amounts of common stock repurchased pursuant to such authorizations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the amount remaining under such authorizations at December 31, 2020.\nCommon stock repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our capital position, liquidity, financial strength and credit ratings, general market conditions, the market price of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock compared to management’s assessment of the stock’s underlying value, applicable regulatory approvals, and other legal and accounting factors. Restrictions on the payment of dividends that may arise under so-called “Dividend Stopper” provisions would also restrict MetLife, Inc.’s ability to repurchase common stock. See “— Dividends” for information about these restrictions. See also “Risk Factors — Capital Risks — We May not be Able to Pay Dividends or Repurchase Our Stock Due to Legal and Regulatory Restrictions or Cash Buffer Needs.”\nDividends\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, MetLife, Inc. paid dividends on its preferred stock of $202 million and $178 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, MetLife, Inc. paid dividends on its common stock of $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the calculation and timing of these dividend payments.\nThe declaration and payment of common stock dividends are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend on MetLife, Inc.’s financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries and other factors deemed relevant by the Board.\n“Dividend Stopper” Provisions in MetLife’s Preferred Stock and Junior Subordinated Debentures\nMetLife, Inc.’s preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures contain “dividend stopper” provisions under which MetLife, Inc. may not pay dividends on instruments junior to those instruments if payments have not been made on those instruments. Moreover, MetLife, Inc.’s Series A preferred stock and its junior subordinated debentures contain provisions that would limit the payment of dividends or interest on those instruments if MetLife, Inc. fails to meet certain tests (“Trigger Events”), to an amount not greater than the net proceeds from sales of common stock and other specified instruments during a period preceding the dividend declaration date or the interest payment date, as applicable. If such proceeds were under the circumstances insufficient to make such payments on those instruments, the dividend stopper provisions affecting common stock (and preferred stock, as applicable) would come into effect.\nA “Trigger Event” would occur if:\n•\nthe RBC ratio of MetLife’s largest U.S. insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate (as defined in the applicable instrument) were to be less than 175% of the company action level based on the subsidiaries’ prior year annual financial statements filed (generally around March 1) with state insurance commissioners; or\n•\nat the end of a quarter (“Final Quarter End Test Date”), consolidated GAAP net income for the four-quarter period ending two quarters before such quarter-end (the “Preliminary Quarter End Test Date”) is zero or a negative amount and the consolidated GAAP stockholders’ equity, minus AOCI (the “adjusted stockholders’ equity amount”), as of the Final Quarter End Test Date and the Preliminary Quarter End Test Date, declined by 10% or more from its level 10 quarters before the Final Quarter End Test Date (the “Benchmark Quarter End Test Date”).\n126\nOnce a Trigger Event occurs for a Final Quarter End Test Date, the suspension of payments of dividends and interest (in the absence of sufficient net proceeds from the issuance of certain securities during specified periods) would continue until there is no Trigger Event at a subsequent Final Quarter End Test Date, and, if the test in the second paragraph above caused the Trigger Event, the adjusted stockholders’ equity amount is no longer 10% or more below its level at the Benchmark Quarter End Test Date that is associated with the Trigger Event. In the case of successive Trigger Events, the suspension would continue until MetLife satisfies these conditions for each of the Trigger Events.\nThe junior subordinated debentures further provide that MetLife, Inc. may, at its option and provided that certain conditions are met, elect to defer payment of interest. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Any such elective deferral would trigger the dividend stopper provisions.\nFurther, MetLife, Inc. is a party to certain replacement capital covenants which limit its ability to eliminate these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase of the junior subordinated debentures by requiring MetLife, Inc., with some limitations, to receive cash proceeds during a specified period from the sale of specified replacement securities prior to any repayment, redemption or purchase. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of such covenants.\nDebt Repayments\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, following regulatory approval, MetLife Reinsurance Company of Charleston, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., repurchased and canceled $148 million and $67 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of its surplus notes, which were reported in collateral financing arrangement on the consolidated balance sheets. See Notes 13 and 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on long-term and short-term debt and the collateral financing arrangement, respectively.\nDebt Repurchases, Redemptions and Exchanges\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, redemptions and/or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such repurchases, redemptions, or exchanges will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions, and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not to repurchase or redeem any debt and the size and timing of any such repurchases or redemptions will be determined at our discretion.\nSee Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the redemption and cancellation of senior notes.\nSupport Agreements\nMetLife, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries (each, an “Obligor”) are parties to various capital support commitments and guarantees with subsidiaries. Under these arrangements, each Obligor has agreed to cause the applicable entity to meet specified capital and surplus levels or has guaranteed certain contractual obligations. We anticipate that in the event these arrangements place demands upon us, there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable us to meet such demands. See Note 5 of the Notes to the MetLife, Inc. (Parent Company Only) Condensed Financial Information included in Schedule II of the Financial Statement Schedules.\nInsurance Liabilities\nLiabilities arising from our insurance activities primarily relate to benefit payments under various life insurance, property and casualty, annuity and group pension products, as well as payments for policy surrenders, withdrawals and loans. For annuity or deposit type products, surrender or lapse behavior differs somewhat by segment. In the MetLife Holdings segment, which includes individual annuities, lapses and surrenders tend to occur in the normal course of business. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, general account surrenders and withdrawals from annuity products were $1.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. In the RIS business within the U.S. segment, which includes pension risk transfers, bank-owned life insurance and other fixed annuity contracts, as well as funding agreements and other capital market products, most of the products offered have fixed maturities or fairly predictable surrenders or withdrawals. With regard to the RIS business products that provide customers with limited rights to accelerate payments, at December 31, 2020, there were funding agreements totaling $132 million that could be put back to the Company.\n127\nPledged Collateral\nWe pledge collateral to, and have collateral pledged to us by, counterparties in connection with our derivatives. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had received pledged cash collateral from counterparties of $7.6 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had pledged cash collateral to counterparties of $266 million and $275 million, respectively. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about collateral pledged to us, collateral we pledge and derivatives subject to credit contingent provisions.\nWe pledge collateral and have had collateral pledged to us, and may be required from time to time to pledge additional collateral or be entitled to have additional collateral pledged to us, in connection with the collateral financing arrangement related to the reinsurance of closed block liabilities. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe pledge collateral from time to time in connection with funding agreements and advance agreements. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSecurities Lending and Repurchase Agreements\nWe participate in a securities lending program and in short-term repurchase agreements whereby securities are loaned to unaffiliated financial institutions. We obtain collateral, usually cash, from the borrower, which must be returned to the borrower when the loaned securities are returned to us. Through these arrangements, we were liable for cash collateral under our control of $21.8 billion and $19.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, including a portion that may require the immediate return of cash collateral we hold. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLitigation\nWe establish liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For material matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible but not probable, no accrual is made but we disclose the nature of the contingency and an aggregate estimate of the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, when such an estimate can be made. It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings. In some of the matters referred to herein, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAcquisitions\nSee Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the acquisition of Versant Health.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our major contractual obligations at December 31, 2020:\n128\nInsurance Liabilities\nInsurance liabilities include future policy benefits, other policy-related balances, policyholder dividends payable and the policyholder dividend obligation, which are all reported on the consolidated balance sheet and are more fully described in Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The amounts presented reflect future estimated cash payments and (i) are based on mortality, morbidity, lapse and other assumptions comparable with our experience and expectations of future payment patterns; and (ii) consider future premium receipts on current policies in-force. All estimated cash payments presented are undiscounted as to interest, net of estimated future premiums on in-force policies and gross of any reinsurance recoverable. Payment of amounts related to policyholder dividends left on deposit are projected based on assumptions of policyholder withdrawal activity. Because the exact timing and amount of the ultimate policyholder dividend obligation is subject to significant uncertainty and the amount of the policyholder dividend obligation is based upon a long-term projection of the performance of the closed block, we have reflected the obligation at the amount of the liability, if any, presented on the consolidated balance sheet in the more than five years category. Additionally, the more than five years category includes estimated payments due for periods extending for more than 100 years.\nThe sum of the estimated cash flows of $354.7 billion exceeds the liability amounts of $227.3 billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; (ii) differences in assumptions, most significantly mortality, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.\nActual cash payments may differ significantly from the liabilities as presented on the consolidated balance sheet and the estimated cash payments as presented due to differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in the establishment of these liabilities and the estimation of these cash payments.\nFor the majority of our insurance operations, estimated contractual obligations for future policy benefits and policyholder account balances, as presented, are derived from the annual asset adequacy analysis used to develop actuarial opinions of statutory reserve adequacy for state regulatory purposes. These cash flows are materially representative of the cash flows under GAAP. See “— Policyholder Account Balances.”\nPolicyholder Account Balances\nSee Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the components of policyholder account balances. See “— Insurance Liabilities” regarding the source and uncertainties associated with the estimation of the contractual obligations related to future policy benefits and policyholder account balances.\nAmounts presented represent the estimated cash payments undiscounted as to interest and including assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and deposits; withdrawals, including unscheduled or partial withdrawals; policy lapses; surrender charges; annuitization; mortality; future interest credited; policy loans and other contingent events as appropriate for the respective product type. Such estimated cash payments are also presented net of estimated future premiums on policies currently in-force and gross of any reinsurance recoverable. For obligations denominated in foreign currencies, cash payments have been estimated using current spot foreign currency rates.\nThe sum of the estimated cash flows of $250.5 billion exceeds the liability amount of $205.2 billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to (i) the time value of money, which accounts for a substantial portion of the difference; (ii) differences in assumptions, between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date; and (iii) liabilities related to accounting conventions, or which are not contractually due, which are excluded.\nPayables for Collateral Under Securities Loaned and Other Transactions\nWe have accepted cash collateral in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, FHLB of Boston short-term advance agreements and derivatives. As these transactions expire within the next year and the timing of the return of the derivatives collateral is uncertain, the return of the collateral has been included in the one year or less category in the table above. We also held non-cash collateral, which is not reflected as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet, of $1.7 billion at December 31, 2020.\n129\nDebt\nAmounts presented for debt include short-term debt, long-term debt, the collateral financing arrangement and junior subordinated debt securities, the total of which differs from the total of the corresponding amounts presented on the consolidated balance sheet as the amounts presented herein (i) do not include premiums or discounts upon issuance or purchase accounting fair value adjustments; (ii) include future interest on such obligations for the period from January 1, 2021 through maturity; and (iii) do not include long-term debt relating to CSEs at December 31, 2020 as such debt does not represent our contractual obligation. Future interest on variable rate debt was computed using prevailing rates at December 31, 2020 and, as such, does not consider the impact of future rate movements. Future interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations for the period from January 1, 2021 through maturity, except with respect to junior subordinated debt which was computed using the stated rates through the scheduled redemption dates as it is our expectation that such obligations will be redeemed as scheduled. Inclusion of interest payments on junior subordinated debt securities through the final maturity dates would increase the contractual obligation by $7.7 billion. Pursuant to the collateral financing arrangement, MetLife, Inc. may be required to deliver cash or pledge collateral to the unaffiliated financial institution. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInvestment Commitments\nTo enhance the return on our investment portfolio, we commit to lend funds under mortgage loans, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments and we commit to fund partnership investments. In the table above, the timing of the funding of mortgage loans and private corporate bond investments is based on the expiration dates of the corresponding commitments. As it relates to commitments to fund partnerships and bank credit facilities, we anticipate that these amounts could be invested any time over the next five years; however, as the timing of the fulfillment of the obligation cannot be predicted, such obligations are generally presented in the one year or less category. Commitments to fund bridge loans are short-term obligations and, as a result, are presented in the one year or less category. See Note 21 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “— Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.”\nOperating Leases\nAs a lessee, we have various operating leases, primarily for office space. Contractual provisions exist that could increase or accelerate those lease obligations presented, including various leases with early buyouts and/or escalation clauses. However, the impact of any such transactions would not be material to our financial position or results of operations. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther\nOther obligations presented are principally comprised of amounts due under reinsurance agreements, payables related to securities purchased but not yet settled, securities sold short, accrued interest on debt obligations, estimated fair value of derivative obligations, deferred compensation arrangements, guaranty liabilities, and accruals and accounts payable due under contractual obligations, which are all reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. If the timing of any of these other obligations is sufficiently uncertain, the amounts are included within the one year or less category. Items reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet that were excluded from the table represent accounting conventions or are not liabilities due under contractual obligations. Unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest totaling $323 million were excluded as the timing of payment could not be reliably determined at December 31, 2020.\nSeparate account liabilities are excluded as they are fully funded by cash flows from the corresponding separate account assets and are set equal to the estimated fair value of separate account assets.\nWe also enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business; however, such amounts are excluded as these purchase obligations were not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position at December 31, 2020.\nAdditionally, we have agreements in place for services we conduct, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Intercompany transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate insurance regulators as required.\n130\nMetLife, Inc.\nLiquidity and Capital Management\nLiquidity and capital are managed to preserve stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash to meet all current and future financial obligations and are provided by a variety of sources, including a portfolio of liquid assets, a diversified mix of short- and long-term funding sources from the wholesale financial markets and the ability to borrow through credit and committed facilities. Liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity risk metrics, including the composition and level of the liquid asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow obligations, access to the financial markets for capital and debt transactions and exposure to contingent draws on MetLife, Inc.’s liquidity. MetLife, Inc. is an active participant in the global financial markets through which it obtains a significant amount of funding. These markets, which serve as cost-effective sources of funds, are critical components of MetLife, Inc.’s liquidity and capital management. Decisions to access these markets are based upon relative costs, prospective views of balance sheet growth and a targeted liquidity profile and capital structure. A disruption in the financial markets could limit MetLife, Inc.’s access to liquidity.\nMetLife, Inc.’s ability to maintain regular access to competitively priced wholesale funds is fostered by its current credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies. We view our capital ratios, credit quality, stable and diverse earnings streams, diversity of liquidity sources and our liquidity monitoring procedures as critical to retaining such credit ratings. See “— The Company — Rating Agencies.”\nLiquidity\nFor a summary of MetLife, Inc.’s liquidity, see “— The Company — Liquidity.”\nCapital\nFor a summary of MetLife, Inc.’s capital, see “— The Company — Capital.” See also “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital Uses — Common Stock Repurchases” for information regarding MetLife, Inc.’s common stock repurchases.\nLiquid Assets\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, MetLife, Inc. and other MetLife holding companies had $4.5 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, in liquid assets. Of these amounts, $3.6 billion and $3.0 billion were held by MetLife, Inc. and $873 million and $1.2 billion were held by other MetLife holding companies at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded securities, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with derivatives and a collateral financing arrangement.\nLiquid assets held in non-U.S. holding companies are generated in part through dividends from non-U.S. insurance operations. Such dividends are subject to local insurance regulatory requirements, as discussed in “— Liquidity and Capital Sources — Dividends from Subsidiaries.” As a result of U.S. Tax Reform, we expect to repatriate future foreign earnings back to the U.S. with minimal or no additional U.S. tax. See Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “— Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Changes in Laws or Regulation, or in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies, May Reduce Our Profitability, Limit Our Growth, or Otherwise Adversely Affect Us.”\nSee “— Executive Summary — Consolidated Company Outlook,” for the targeted level of liquid assets at the holding companies.\n131\nMetLife, Inc. and Other MetLife Holding Companies Sources and Uses of Liquid Assets and Sources and Uses of Liquid Assets included in Free Cash Flow\nMetLife, Inc.’s sources and uses of liquid assets, as well as sources and uses of liquid assets included in free cash flow are summarized as follows.\n132\n__________________\n(1)\nDividends and returns of capital to MetLife, Inc. included $3.1 billion and $3.7 billion from operating subsidiaries and $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion from other MetLife holding companies for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(2)\nIncluded in free cash flow is the portion of long-term debt issued and preferred stock issuance, net of redemption of preferred stock and preferred stock redemption premium that represents incremental debt to be at or below target leverage ratios.\n(3)\nSee MetLife, Inc. (Parent Company Only) Condensed Statements of Cash Flows included in Schedule II of the Financial Statement Schedules for information regarding the source of liquid assets from receipts on loans to subsidiaries (excluding interest) and the use of liquid assets related to the issuances of loans to subsidiaries (excluding interest).\n(4)\nOther, net includes $296 million and $155 million of net receipts (payments) by MetLife, Inc. to and from subsidiaries under a tax sharing agreement and tax payments to tax agencies for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(5)\nAmounts to fund business acquisitions were $1.9 billion (included in other, net) and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(6)\nSee “— Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures” for the reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities of MetLife, Inc. to free cash flow of all holding companies.\nSources and Uses of Liquid Assets of MetLife, Inc.\nThe primary sources of MetLife, Inc.’s liquid assets are dividends and returns of capital from subsidiaries, issuances of long-term debt, issuances of common and preferred stock, and net receipts from subsidiaries under a tax sharing agreement. MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their respective domiciles. See “— Liquidity and Capital Sources — Dividends from Subsidiaries.”\nThe primary uses of MetLife, Inc.’s liquid assets are principal and interest payments on long-term debt, dividends on and repurchases of common and preferred stock, capital contributions to subsidiaries, funding of business acquisitions, income taxes and operating expenses. MetLife, Inc. is party to various capital support commitments and guarantees with certain of its subsidiaries. See “— Liquidity and Capital Uses — Support Agreements.”\nIn addition, MetLife, Inc. issues loans to subsidiaries or subsidiaries issue loans to MetLife, Inc. Accordingly, changes in MetLife, Inc. liquid assets include issuances of loans to subsidiaries, proceeds of loans from subsidiaries and the related repayment of principal and payment of interest on such loans. See “— Liquidity and Capital Sources — Affiliated Long-term Debt” and “— Liquidity and Capital Uses — Affiliated Capital and Debt Transactions.”\nSources and Uses of Liquid Assets of Other MetLife Holding Companies\nThe primary sources of liquid assets of other MetLife holding companies are dividends, returns of capital and remittances from their subsidiaries and branches, principally non-U.S. insurance companies; capital contributions received; receipts of principal and interest on loans to subsidiaries and affiliates and borrowings from subsidiaries and affiliates. MetLife, Inc.’s non-U.S. operations are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by local regulators. See “— Liquidity and Capital Sources — Dividends from Subsidiaries.”\nThe primary uses of liquid assets of other MetLife holding companies are capital contributions paid to their subsidiaries and branches, principally non-U.S. insurance companies; loans to subsidiaries and affiliates; principal and interest paid on loans from subsidiaries and affiliates; dividends and returns of capital to MetLife, Inc. and the following items, which are reported within other, net: business acquisitions; and operating expenses. There were no uses of liquid assets of other MetLife holding companies to fund business acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Sources\nIn addition to the description of liquidity and capital sources in “— The Company — Summary of the Company’s Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital” and “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources,” MetLife, Inc.’s primary sources of liquidity and capital are set forth below.\n133\nDividends from Subsidiaries\nMetLife, Inc. relies, in part, on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its cash requirements. MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their respective domiciles. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The dividend limitation for U.S. insurance subsidiaries is generally based on the surplus to policyholders at the end of the immediately preceding calendar year and statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year. Statutory accounting practices, as prescribed by insurance regulators of various states in which we conduct business, differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. The significant differences relate to the treatment of DAC, certain deferred income tax, required investment liabilities, statutory reserve calculation assumptions, goodwill and surplus notes.\nThe table below sets forth the dividends permitted to be paid by MetLife, Inc.’s primary U.S. insurance subsidiaries without insurance regulatory approval and the actual dividends paid:\n__________________\n(1)\nReflects dividend amounts that may be paid during the relevant year without prior regulatory approval. However, because dividend tests may be based on dividends previously paid over rolling 12-month periods, if paid before a specified date during such year, some or all of such dividends may require regulatory approval.\n(2)\nReflects all amounts paid, including those where regulatory approval was obtained as required.\n(3)\nIncludes a $341 million non-cash dividend.\n(4)\nSee Note 3 for information regarding the pending disposition of MetLife P&C which may impact the ability of MetLife P&C to pay a dividend to MetLife, Inc. in 2021.\nIn addition to the amounts presented in the table above, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, MetLife, Inc. also received cash payments of $29 million and $195 million, respectively, representing dividends from certain other subsidiaries. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, MetLife, Inc. received cash returns of capital of $16 million and $10 million, respectively.\nThe dividend capacity of our non-U.S. operations is subject to similar restrictions established by the local regulators. The non-U.S. regulatory regimes also commonly limit dividend payments to the parent company to a portion of the subsidiary’s prior year statutory income, as determined by the local accounting principles. The regulators of our non-U.S. operations, including the FSA, may also limit or not permit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the U.S. if such transfers are deemed to be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of the non-U.S. operations, or for other reasons. Most of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are second tier subsidiaries which are owned by various non-U.S. holding companies. The capital and rating considerations applicable to our first tier subsidiaries may also impact the dividend flow into MetLife, Inc.\nWe proactively manage target and excess capital levels and dividend flows and forecast local capital positions as part of the financial planning cycle. The dividend capacity of certain U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries is also subject to business targets in excess of the minimum capital necessary to maintain the desired rating or level of financial strength in the relevant market. See “Risk Factors — Capital Risks — Our Subsidiaries May be Unable to Pay Dividends, a Major Component of Holding Company Free Cash Flow” and Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAffiliated Long-term Debt\nSee “Senior Notes — Affiliated” in Note 4 of the Notes to the MetLife, Inc. (Parent Company Only) Condensed Financial Information included in Schedule II of the Financial Statement Schedules for information on affiliated long-term debt.\n134\nCollateral Financing Arrangement and Junior Subordinated Debt Securities\nFor information on MetLife, Inc.’s collateral financing arrangement and junior subordinated debt securities, see Notes 14 and 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively.\nCredit and Committed Facilities\nSee Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Company’s unsecured revolving credit facility and certain committed facilities.\nLong-term Debt Outstanding\nThe following table summarizes the outstanding long-term debt of MetLife, Inc. at:\nDebt and Facility Covenants\nCertain of MetLife, Inc.’s debt instruments and committed facilities, as well as its unsecured revolving credit facility, contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. MetLife, Inc. believes it was in compliance with all applicable financial covenants at December 31, 2020.\nDispositions\nFor information regarding the pending disposition of MetLife P&C, see Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Uses\nThe primary uses of liquidity of MetLife, Inc. include debt service, cash dividends on common and preferred stock, capital contributions to subsidiaries, common stock, preferred stock and debt repurchases, payment of general operating expenses and acquisitions. Based on our analysis and comparison of our current and future cash inflows from the dividends we receive from subsidiaries that are permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory approval, our investment portfolio and other cash flows and anticipated access to the capital markets, we believe there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable MetLife, Inc. to make payments on debt, pay cash dividends on its common and preferred stock, contribute capital to its subsidiaries, repurchase its common stock and certain of its other securities, pay all general operating expenses and meet its cash needs under current market conditions and reasonably possible stress scenarios.\nIn addition to the description of liquidity and capital uses in “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital Uses” and “— The Company — Contractual Obligations,” MetLife, Inc.’s primary uses of liquidity and capital are set forth below.\nAffiliated Capital and Debt Transactions\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, excluding acquisitions, MetLife, Inc. invested a net amount of $425 million and $89 million, respectively, in various subsidiaries.\nMetLife, Inc. lends funds, as necessary, through credit agreements or otherwise to its subsidiaries and affiliates, some of which are regulated, to meet their capital requirements or to provide liquidity. MetLife, Inc. had loans to subsidiaries outstanding of $0 and $100 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In June 2020, the $100 million loan was repaid at maturity.\nDebt Repayments\nFor information on MetLife, Inc.’s debt repayments, see “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital Uses — Debt Repayments.” MetLife, Inc. intends to repay or refinance, in whole or in part, all the debt that is due in 2021.\n135\nMaturities of Senior Notes\nThe following table summarizes MetLife, Inc.’s outstanding senior notes by year of maturity, excluding any premium or discount and unamortized issuance costs, at December 31, 2020:\nSupport Agreements\nMetLife, Inc. is party to various capital support commitments and guarantees with certain of its subsidiaries. See Note 5 of the Notes to the MetLife, Inc. (Parent Company Only) Condensed Financial Information included in Schedule II of the Financial Statement Schedules.\nAcquisitions\nSee Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the acquisition of Versant Health.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFuture Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n136\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures\nIn this report, the Company presents certain measures of its performance on a consolidated and segment basis that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding for the Company and our investors of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business. Segment-specific financial measures are calculated using only the portion of consolidated results attributable to that specific segment.\nThe following non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP:\nAny of these financial measures shown on a constant currency basis reflect the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are calculated using the average foreign currency exchange rates for the most recent period and applied to the comparable prior period (“constant currency basis”).\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP financial measures are included in “— Results of Operations” and “— Investments.” Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis because we believe it is not possible without unreasonable effort to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly within or outside the range and from period to period and may have a material impact on net income.\nOur definitions of non-GAAP and other financial measures discussed in this report may differ from those used by other companies.\nAdjusted earnings and related measures:\n•\nadjusted earnings;\n•\nadjusted earnings available to common shareholders; and\n•\nadjusted earnings available to common shareholders on a constant currency basis.\nThese measures are used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings and components of, or other financial measures based on, adjusted earnings are also our GAAP measures of segment performance. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings are also the measures by which senior management’s and many other employees’ performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings allow analysis of our performance relative to our business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results.\nAdjusted earnings is defined as adjusted revenues less adjusted expenses, net of income tax. Adjusted loss is defined as negative adjusted earnings. Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders is defined as adjusted earnings less preferred stock dividends. For information relating to adjusted revenues and adjusted expenses, see “Financial Measures and Segment Accounting Policies” in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition, adjusted earnings available to common shareholders excludes the impact of preferred stock redemption premium, which is reported as a reduction to net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders.\nReturn on equity, allocated equity and related measures:\n•\nTotal MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, is defined as total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding the net unrealized investment gains (losses) and defined benefit plans adjustment components of AOCI, net of income tax.\n137\n•\nAdjusted return on MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity is defined as adjusted earnings available to common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc.’s average common stockholders’ equity.\n•\nAdjusted return on MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, is defined as adjusted earnings available to common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc.’s average common stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA.\n•\nAllocated equity is the portion of MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity that management allocates to each of its segments and sub-segments based on local capital requirements and economic capital. See “— Economic Capital.” Allocated equity excludes the impact of AOCI other than FCTA.\nThe above measures represent a level of equity consistent with the view that, in the ordinary course of business, we do not plan to sell most investments for the sole purpose of realizing gains or losses. Also, refer to the utilization of adjusted earnings and components of, or other financial measures based on, adjusted earnings mentioned above.\nExpense ratio and direct expense ratio:\n•\nExpense ratio: other expenses, net of capitalization of DAC, divided by premiums, fees and other revenues.\n•\nDirect expense ratio: adjusted direct expenses divided by adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues. Direct expenses are comprised of employee-related costs, third party staffing costs, and general and administrative expenses.\n•\nDirect expense ratio, excluding total notable items related to direct expenses and pension risk transfers: adjusted direct expenses excluding total notable items related to direct expenses, divided by adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding pension risk transfers.\nThe following additional information is relevant to an understanding of our performance results and outlook:\n•\nWe sometimes refer to sales activity for various products. These sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, but are used as relevant measures of business activity. Further, sales statistics for our Latin America, Asia and EMEA segments are on a constant currency basis.\n•\nNear-term represents one to three years.\n•\nWe refer to observable forward yield curves as of a particular date in connection with making our estimates for future results. The observable forward yield curves at a given time are based on implied future interest rates along a range of interest rate durations. This includes the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate which we use as a benchmark rate to describe longer-term interest rates used in our estimates for future results.\n•\nAsymmetrical and non-economic accounting refers to: (i) the portion of net derivative gains (losses) on embedded derivatives attributable to the inclusion of our credit spreads in the liability valuations, (ii) hedging activity that generates net derivative gains (losses) and creates fluctuations in net income because hedge accounting cannot be achieved and the item being hedged does not a have an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings, (iii) inflation-indexed benefit adjustments associated with contracts backed by inflation-indexed investments and amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets and other pass through adjustments, and (iv) impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the re-measurement of foreign denominated unhedged funding agreements and financing transactions to the U.S. dollar and the re-measurement of certain liabilities from non-functional currencies to functional currencies. We believe that excluding the impact of asymmetrical and non-economic accounting from total GAAP results enhances investor understanding of our performance by disclosing how these accounting practices affect reported GAAP results.\n•\nNotable items represent a positive (negative) impact to adjusted earnings available to common shareholders. Notable items reflect the unexpected impact of events that affect MetLife’s results, but that were unknown and that MetLife could not anticipate when it devised its business plan. Notable items also include certain items regardless of the extent anticipated in the business plan, to help investors have a better understanding of MetLife’s results and to evaluate and forecast those results.\n138\n•\nThe Company uses a measure of free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of its ability to generate cash for reinvestment into its businesses or use in non-mandatory capital actions. The Company defines free cash flow as the sum of cash available at MetLife’s holding companies from dividends from operating subsidiaries, expenses and other net flows of the holding companies (including capital contributions to subsidiaries), and net contributions from debt to be at or below target leverage ratios. This measure of free cash flow is prior to capital actions, such as common stock dividends and repurchases, debt reduction and mergers and acquisitions. Free cash flow should not be viewed as a substitute for net cash provided by (used in) operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP. The free cash flow ratio is typically expressed as a percentage of annual adjusted earnings available to common shareholders. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities of MetLife, Inc. (parent company only) to free cash flow of all holding companies for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is provided below.\n__________________\n(1)\nIncluding the free cash flow of other MetLife, Inc. holding companies of ($677) million and $572 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in the numerator of the ratio, this ratio, as adjusted, would be 54% and 83%, respectively.\n(2)\ni) Consolidated adjusted earnings available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2020 was negatively impacted by a notable item related to actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments of $203 million, net of income tax. Excluding this notable item from the denominator of the ratio, the adjusted free cash flow ratio for 2020 would be 69%.\n139\nii) Consolidated adjusted earnings available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2019 was positively impacted by notable items, primarily related to tax related adjustments, of $539 million, net of income tax, partially offset by expense initiative costs of $332 million, net of income tax. Excluding such notable items from the denominator of the ratio, the adjusted free cash flow ratio for the year ended December 31, 2019 would be 87%.\n140"

    "text": "Risk Management\nWe have an integrated process for managing risk, which we conduct through multiple Board and senior management committees (financial and non-financial) across the Global Risk Management, ALM, Finance, Treasury, Investments and business segment departments. The risk committee structure is designed to provide a consolidated enterprise-wide assessment and management of risk. The ERC is responsible for reviewing all material risks to the enterprise and deciding on actions, if necessary, in the event risks exceed desired tolerances, taking into consideration industry best practices and the current environment to resolve or mitigate those risks. Additional committees at the MetLife, Inc. and subsidiary company level manage capital and risk positions and establish corporate business standards.\nGlobal Risk Management\nIndependent from the lines of business, the centralized Global Risk Management department, led by the CRO, coordinates across all committees to ensure that all material risks are properly identified, measured, aggregated, managed and reported across the Company. The CRO reports to the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and is primarily responsible for maintaining and communicating the Company’s enterprise risk policies and for monitoring and analyzing all material risks.\nGlobal Risk Management considers and monitors a full range of risks against the Company’s solvency, liquidity, earnings, business operations and reputation. Global Risk Management’s primary responsibilities consist of:\n•\nimplementing an enterprise risk framework, which outlines our enterprise approach for managing risk;\n•\ndeveloping policies and procedures for identifying, managing, measuring, monitoring and controlling those risks identified in the enterprise risk framework;\n•\ncoordinating\nORSAs for Board, senior management and regulator use;\n•\nestablishing appropriate enterprise risk tolerance levels;\n•\nrecommending risk appetite statements and investment general authorizations to the Board;\n•\nmeasuring capital on an economic basis; and\n•\nreporting to (i) the Finance and Risk Committee of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors; (ii) the Investment Committee of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors; (iii) the Compensation Committee of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors; and (iv) the financial and non-financial senior management committees on various aspects of risk.\nAsset/Liability Management\nWe actively manage our assets using an approach that is liability driven and balances quality, diversification, asset/liability matching, liquidity, concentration and investment return. The goals of the investment process are to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that the assets and liabilities are reasonably aligned on a cash flow and duration basis. The ALM process is the shared responsibility of the ALM, Global Risk Management, and Investments departments, with the engagement of senior members of the business segments and Finance, and is governed by the ALM Committees. The ALM Committees’ duties include reviewing and approving investment guidelines and limits, approving significant portfolio and ALM strategies and providing oversight of the ALM process. The directives of the ALM Committees are carried out and monitored through ALM Working Groups which are set up to manage risk by geography, product or portfolio type. The ALM Steering Committee oversees the activities of the underlying ALM Committees and Working Groups. The ALM Steering Committee reports to the ERC.\nWe establish portfolio guidelines that define ranges and limits related to asset allocation, interest rate risk, liquidity, concentration and other risks for each major business segment, legal entity or insurance product group. These guidelines support implementation of investment strategies used to adequately fund our liabilities within acceptable levels of risk. We also establish hedging programs and associated investment portfolios for different blocks of business. The ALM Working Groups monitor these strategies and programs through regular review of portfolio metrics, such as effective duration, yield curve sensitivity, convexity, value at risk, market sensitivities (to interest rates, equity market levels, equity volatility, and foreign currency exchange rates), stress scenario payoffs, liquidity, asset sector concentration and credit quality.\n141\nMarket Risk Exposures\nWe regularly analyze our exposure to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity market price risk. As a result of that analysis, we have determined that the estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities are materially exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets. We have exposure to market risk through our insurance operations and investment activities. For purposes of this disclosure, “market risk” is defined as the risk of loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity markets.\nInterest Rates\nOur exposure to interest rate changes results most significantly from our holdings of fixed maturity securities and derivatives, as well as our interest rate sensitive liabilities. The fixed maturity securities AFS include U.S. and foreign government bonds, securities issued by government agencies, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and ABS, all of which are mainly exposed to changes in medium- and long-term interest rates. The interest rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure include debt, policyholder account balances related to certain investment type contracts, and embedded derivatives on variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits which have the same type of interest rate exposure (medium- and long-term interest rates) as fixed maturity securities AFS. The interest rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure exclude a significant portion of the liabilities relating to insurance contracts. See “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — We May Face Difficult Economic Conditions.”\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nOur exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar results from our holdings in non-U.S. dollar denominated fixed maturity and equity securities, mortgage loans, and certain liabilities, as well as through our investments in foreign subsidiaries. The foreign currency exchange rate liabilities for purposes of this disclosure exclude a significant portion of the liabilities relating to insurance contracts. The principal currencies that create foreign currency exchange rate risk in our investment portfolios and liabilities are the Euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound. Selectively, we use U.S. dollar assets to support certain long-duration foreign currency liabilities. Through our investments in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures, we are primarily exposed to the Japanese yen, the Euro, the Australian dollar, the British pound, the Mexican peso, the Chilean peso and the Korean won. In addition to hedging with foreign currency swaps, forwards and options, local surplus in some countries may be held entirely or in part in U.S. dollar assets, which further minimize exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk. We have matched much of our foreign currency liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency assets, thereby reducing our risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. See “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets Risks — We May Face Difficult Economic Conditions.”\nEquity Market\nAlong with investments in equity securities, we have exposure to equity market risk through certain liabilities that involve long-term guarantees on equity performance such as embedded derivatives on variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits and certain policyholder account balances. Equity exposures associated with limited partnership interests are excluded from this discussion as they are not considered financial instruments under GAAP.\n142\nManagement of Market Risk Exposures\nWe use a variety of strategies to manage interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity market risk, including the use of derivatives.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nTo manage interest rate risk, we analyze interest rate risk using various models, including multi-scenario cash flow projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting investments, including derivatives. These projections involve evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of our in-force business under various increasing and decreasing interest rate environments. The NYDFS regulations require that we perform some of these analyses annually as part of our review of the sufficiency of our regulatory reserves. For several of our legal entities, we maintain segmented operating and surplus asset portfolios for the purpose of ALM and the allocation of investment income to product lines. In the U.S., for each segment, invested assets greater than or equal to the GAAP liabilities net of certain non-invested assets allocated to the segment are maintained, with any excess allocated to Corporate & Other. The business segments may reflect differences in legal entity, statutory line of business and any product market characteristic which may drive a distinct investment strategy with respect to duration, liquidity or credit quality of the invested assets. Certain smaller entities make use of unsegmented general accounts for which the investment strategy reflects the aggregate characteristics of liabilities in those entities. We measure relative sensitivities of the value of our assets and liabilities to changes in key assumptions utilizing internal models. These models reflect specific product characteristics and include assumptions based on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse, mortality, morbidity and interest crediting rates. In addition, these models include asset cash flow projections reflecting interest payments, sinking fund payments, principal payments, bond calls, mortgage loan prepayments and defaults.\nWe employ product design, pricing and ALM strategies to reduce the potential effects of interest rate movements. Product design and pricing strategies include the use of surrender charges or restrictions on withdrawals in some products and the ability to reset crediting rates for certain products. ALM strategies include the use of derivatives. We also use reinsurance to mitigate interest rate risk.\nWe also use common industry metrics, such as duration and convexity, to measure the relative sensitivity of assets and liability values to changes in interest rates. In computing the duration of liabilities, we consider all policyholder guarantees and how we intend to set indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or dividends. Each asset portfolio or portfolio group has a duration target based on the liability duration and the investment objectives of that portfolio. Where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity of available assets, we may support such liabilities with equity investments, derivatives or interest rate curve mismatch strategies.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Management\nMetLife has a well-established policy to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures within its risk tolerance. In general, investments backing specific liabilities are currency matched. This is achieved through direct investments in matching currency or through the use of foreign currency exchange derivatives. Enterprise foreign currency exchange rate risk limits are established by the ERC. Management of each of our segments, with oversight from our FX Working Group and the ALM committee for the respective segment, is responsible for managing any foreign currency exchange rate exposure.\nWe use foreign currency swaps, forwards and options to mitigate the liability exposure, risk of loss and financial statement volatility associated with our investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated fixed income investments and the sale of certain insurance products.\nEquity Market Risk Management\nWe manage equity market risk on an integrated basis with other risks through our ALM strategies, including the dynamic hedging of certain variable annuity guarantee benefits, as well as reinsurance, in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to large risks, and provide additional capacity for future growth. We also manage equity market risk exposure in our investment portfolio through the use of derivatives. These derivatives include exchange-traded equity futures, equity index options contracts, TRRs and equity variance swaps. This risk is managed by our ALM Department in partnership with the Investments Department.\n143\nHedging Activities\nWe use derivative contracts primarily to hedge a wide range of risks including interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, and equity market risk. Derivative hedges are designed to reduce risk on an economic basis while considering their impact on financial results under different accounting regimes, including U.S. GAAP and local statutory accounting. Our derivative hedge programs vary depending on the type of risk being hedged. Some hedge programs are asset or liability specific while others are portfolio hedges that reduce risk related to a group of liabilities or assets. Our use of derivatives by major hedge programs is as follows:\n•\nRisks Related to Guarantee Benefits — We use a wide range of derivative contracts to mitigate the risk associated with living guarantee benefits. These derivatives include equity and interest rate futures, interest rate swaps, currency futures/forwards, equity indexed options, TRRs, interest rate option contracts and equity variance swaps.\n•\nMinimum Interest Rate Guarantees — For certain liability contracts, we provide the contractholder a guaranteed minimum interest rate. These contracts include certain fixed annuities and other insurance liabilities. We purchase interest rate caps and floors to reduce risk associated with these liability guarantees.\n•\nReinvestment Risk in Long-Duration Liability Contracts — Derivatives are used to hedge interest rate risk related to certain long-duration liability contracts. Hedges include interest rate swaps, swaptions and Treasury bond forwards.\n•\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk — We use foreign currency swaps, forwards and options to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk. These hedges are generally used to swap foreign currency denominated bonds, investments in foreign subsidiaries or equity market exposures to U.S. dollars. Our foreign subsidiaries also use these hedges to swap non-local currency assets to local currency, to match liabilities\n.\n•\nGeneral ALM Hedging Strategies — In the ordinary course of managing our asset/liability risks, we use interest rate futures, interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, interest rate floors, and inflation swaps. These hedges are designed to reduce interest rate risk or inflation risk related to the existing assets or liabilities or related to expected future cash flows.\n•\nMacro Hedge Program — We use equity options, equity TRRs, interest rate swaptions and interest rate swaps to mitigate the potential loss of legal entity statutory capital under stress scenarios.\nRisk Measurement: Sensitivity Analysis\nWe measure market risk related to our market sensitive assets and liabilities based on changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity market prices utilizing a sensitivity analysis. For purposes of this disclosure, a significant portion of the liabilities relating to insurance contracts is excluded, as discussed further below. This analysis estimates the potential changes in estimated fair value based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase or decrease) in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity market prices. We believe that a 10% change (increase or decrease) in these market rates and prices is reasonably possible in the near term. In performing the analysis summarized below, we used market rates at December 31, 2020. The sensitivity analysis separately calculates each of our market risk exposures (interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity market) relating to our assets and liabilities. We modeled the impact of changes (increases and decreases) in market rates and prices on the estimated fair values of our market sensitive assets and liabilities and present the results with the most adverse level of market risk impact to the Company for each of these market risk exposures as follows:\n•\nthe net present values of our interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a 10% change (increase or decrease) in interest rates;\n•\nestimated fair values of our foreign currency exchange rate sensitive exposures due to a 10% change (appreciation or depreciation) in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to all other currencies; and\n•\nthe estimated fair value of our equity market sensitive exposures due to a 10% change (increase or decrease) in equity market prices.\n144\nThe sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of our future financial performance. We cannot ensure that our actual losses in any particular period will not exceed the amounts indicated in the table below. Limitations related to this sensitivity analysis include:\n•\ninterest sensitive and foreign currency exchange rate sensitive liabilities do not include $223.8 billion, at carrying value, of insurance contracts. Management believes that the changes in the economic value of those contracts under changing interest rates and changing foreign currency exchange rates would offset a significant portion of the fair value changes of interest sensitive and foreign currency exchange rate sensitive assets;\n•\nthe market risk information is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related sensitivity analysis, including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgage loans;\n•\nsensitivities do not include the impact on asset or liability valuation of changes in market liquidity or changes in market credit spreads;\n•\nforeign currency exchange rate risk is not isolated for certain embedded derivatives within host asset and liability contracts, as the risk on these instruments is reflected as equity;\n•\nfor the derivatives that qualify as hedges, and for certain other assets such as mortgage loans, the impact on reported earnings may be materially different from the change in market values;\n•\nthe analysis excludes liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts, as well as real estate holdings, private equity and hedge fund holdings; and\n•\nthe model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities remains unchanged throughout the period.\nAccordingly, we use such models as tools and not as substitutes for the experience and judgment of our management. Based on our analysis of the impact of a 10% change (increase or decrease) in market rates and prices, we have determined that such a change could have a material adverse effect on the estimated fair value of certain assets and liabilities from interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity market exposures.\nThe table below illustrates the potential loss in estimated fair value for each market risk exposure based on market sensitive assets and liabilities at:\n__________________\nThe risk sensitivities derived used a 10% increase to interest rates, a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, and a 10% increase in equity prices. The potential losses in estimated fair value presented are for non-trading securities.\n145\nThe table below provides additional detail regarding the potential loss in estimated fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments due to a 10% increase in interest rates at:\n__________________\n(1)\nSeparate account assets and liabilities and Unit-linked investments and associated policyholder account balances, which are interest rate sensitive, are not included herein as any interest rate risk is borne by the contractholder, notwithstanding any general account guarantees which are included within embedded derivatives (see footnote (2) below) or included within future policy benefits and other policy-related balances (see footnote (3) below). Long-term debt excludes $5 million related to CSEs.\n146\n(2)\nEmbedded derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet in the same caption as the host contract.\n(3)\nExcludes $223.8 billion of liabilities, at carrying value, pursuant to insurance contracts reported within future policy benefits and other policy-related balances. These liabilities would economically offset a significant portion of the net change in fair value of our financial instruments resulting from a 10% increase in interest rates.\nSensitivity to interest rates decreased $1.2 billion to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2020 from $5.2 billion at December 31, 2019.\nThe table below provides additional detail regarding the potential loss in estimated fair value of our portfolio due to a 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar compared to all other currencies at:\n__________________\n147\n(1)\nDoes not necessarily represent those financial instruments solely subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Separate account assets and liabilities and Unit-linked investments and associated policyholder account balances, which are foreign currency exchange rate sensitive, are not included herein as any foreign currency exchange rate risk is borne by the contractholder, notwithstanding any general account guarantees which are included within embedded derivatives (see footnote (2) below) or included within future policy benefits and other policy-related balances (see footnote (3) below). Long-term debt excludes $5 million related to CSEs.\n(2)\nEmbedded derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet in the same caption as the host contract.\n(3)\nExcludes $223.8 billion of liabilities, at carrying value, pursuant to insurance contracts reported within future policy benefits and other policy-related balances. These liabilities would economically offset a significant portion of the net change in fair value of our financial instruments resulting from a 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar compared to all other currencies.\nSensitivity to foreign currency exchange rates increased $0.1 billion to $8.4 billion at December 31, 2020 from $8.3 billion at December 31, 2019. These sensitivities exclude those liabilities, at carrying value, pursuant to insurance contracts reported within future policy benefits and other policy-related balances. These liabilities would economically offset a significant portion of the net change in fair value of our financial instruments resulting from a 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar compared to all other currencies.\n148\nThe table below provides additional detail regarding the potential loss in estimated fair value of our portfolio due to a 10% increase in equity prices at:\n__________________\n(1)\nDoes not necessarily represent those financial instruments solely subject to equity price risk. Additionally, separate account assets and liabilities and Unit-linked investments and associated policyholder account balances, which are equity market sensitive, are not included herein as any equity market risk is borne by the contractholder, notwithstanding any general account guarantees which are included within embedded derivatives (see footnote (2) below) or included within future policy benefits and other policy-related balances (see footnote (3) below).\n(2)\nEmbedded derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet in the same caption as the host contract.\n(3)\nExcludes $223.8 billion of liabilities, at carrying value, pursuant to insurance contracts reported within future policy benefits and other policy-related balances.\nSensitivity to equity market prices increased $337 million to $370 million at December 31, 2020 from $33 million at December 31, 2019.\n149"

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n151\nFixed Maturity Securities Available-for-Sale — Fair Value of Level 3 Fixed Maturity Securities — Refer to Notes 1, 8, and 10 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company has investments in certain fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale whose fair values are based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. When a price is not available in the active market, from an independent pricing service, or from independent broker quotations, management values the security using internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques. These investments are categorized as Level 3 and had an estimated fair value of $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nGiven management uses considerable judgment when estimating the fair value of Level 3 fixed maturity securities determined using internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques, performing audit procedures to evaluate the estimate of fair value required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort. This audit effort included the use of professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, including our fair value specialists, to assist in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the valuation of Level 3 fixed maturity securities determined using internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the determination of fair value.\n•\nWe tested the accuracy and completeness of relevant security attributes, including credit ratings, maturity dates and coupon rates, used in the determination of Level 3 fair values.\n•\nWith the involvement of our fair value specialists, we developed independent fair value estimates for a sample of securities and compared our estimates to the Company’s estimates and evaluated differences. We developed our estimate by evaluating the observable and unobservable inputs used by management or developing independent inputs.\n•\nWe evaluated management’s ability to accurately estimate fair value by comparing management’s historical estimates to subsequent transactions, taking into account changes in market conditions subsequent to December 31, 2020.\nInsurance Liabilities — Valuation of Future Policy Benefits for Long-Term Care Insurance — Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s products include long-term care insurance. Liabilities for amounts payable under long-term care insurance are recorded in future policy benefits in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Such liabilities are established based on actuarial assumptions at the time policies are issued, which are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Significant adverse changes in experience on such contracts may require the establishment of premium deficiency reserves, which are based on current assumptions. Management’s estimate of future policy benefits for long-term care insurance was $14.3 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nManagement applies considerable judgment in evaluating actual experience to determine whether a change in assumptions for long-term care insurance is warranted. Principal assumptions used in the valuation of future policy benefits for long-term care insurance include morbidity, policy lapse, investment returns and mortality.\n152\nGiven the inherent uncertainty in selecting assumptions, we have determined that management’s evaluation of actual experience when estimating future policy benefits for long-term care insurance policies is a critical audit matter, which required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the judgments made and the reasonableness of the assumptions used in the valuation.\nThe audit effort included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge, including our actuarial specialists, to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the assumptions used to determine the estimate of future policy benefits for long-term care insurance, included, among others, the following:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of the control over the assumptions used in the valuation of future policy benefits and the effectiveness of the controls over the underlying data.\n•\nWith the involvement of our actuarial specialists, we:\n◦\nevaluated judgments applied by management in setting principal assumptions, including evaluating the results of experience studies used as the basis for setting those assumptions.\n◦\nevaluated management’s estimate of, or developed an independent estimate of future policy benefits, on a sample basis, and evaluated differences. This included confirming that assumptions were applied as intended.\n◦\nevaluated the results of the Company’s annual premium deficiency tests.\nDerivatives — Valuation of Embedded Derivative Liabilities — Refer to Notes 1, 4, 9, and 10 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s products include variable annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum benefits that provide the policyholder a minimum return based on their initial deposit adjusted for withdrawals. The guarantees on variable annuity contracts are accounted for as insurance liabilities or as embedded derivatives depending on how and when the benefit is paid. Guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives include the non-life contingent portion of guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits and certain non-life contingent portions of guaranteed minimum income benefits and are recorded in policyholder account balances on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Embedded derivatives are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract using actuarial and capital market assumptions that are updated annually. Management’s estimate of embedded derivative liabilities was $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nManagement applies considerable judgment in selecting assumptions used to estimate embedded derivative liabilities and changes in market conditions or variations in certain assumptions could result in significant fluctuations in the estimate. Principal assumptions include mortality, lapse, dynamic lapse, withdrawal, utilization, and risk-free rates and implied volatilities. The valuation of the embedded derivative liabilities is also based on complex calculations which are data intensive.\nGiven the inherent uncertainty in selecting assumptions and the complexity of the calculations, we have determined that management’s valuation of the embedded derivative liabilities is a critical audit matter which required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the judgments made and the reasonableness of the models and assumptions used in the valuation. The audit effort included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge, including our valuation, modeling and actuarial specialists, to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures.\n153\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the valuation of embedded derivative liabilities included, among others, the following:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the assumptions, including controls over the underlying data used in the valuation of embedded derivative liabilities.\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the methodologies and models used for determining the embedded derivative liabilities.\n•\nWith the involvement of our valuation, modeling and actuarial specialists, we:\n◦\nevaluated the methods, models, and judgments applied by management in the determination of principal assumptions and the calculation of the embedded derivative liabilities\n◦\nevaluated the results of underlying experience studies, capital market projections, and judgments applied by management in setting the assumptions\n◦\ndeveloped an independent estimate of the embedded derivative liabilities, on a sample basis, and evaluated differences.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 18, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1968; however, an earlier year could not be reliably determined.\n154\nMetLife, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019\n(In millions, except share and per share data)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n155\nMetLife, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\n(In millions, except per share data)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n156\nMetLife, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n157\nMetLife, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Equity\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n158\nMetLife, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n159\nMetLife, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows — (continued)\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n160\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBusiness\n“MetLife” and the “Company” refer to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999, its subsidiaries and affiliates. MetLife is one of the world’s leading financial services companies, providing insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. MetLife is organized into\nfive\nsegments: U.S.; Asia; Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and MetLife Holdings.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, including uncertainties associated with the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic (the “COVID-19 Pandemic”). Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to the Company’s business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nConsolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries, as well as partnerships and joint ventures in which the Company has control, and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nHeld-for-Sale\nThe Company classifies a business as held-for-sale when management has approved or received approval to sell the business, the sale is probable to occur during the next 12 months at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current estimated fair value and certain other specified criteria are met. The business classified as held-for-sale is recorded at the lower of the carrying value and estimated fair value, less cost to sell. If the carrying value of the business exceeds its estimated fair value, less cost to sell, a loss is recognized and reported in Net investment gains (losses). Assets and liabilities related to the business classified as held-for-sale are separately reported in the Company's consolidated balance sheets in the period in which the business is classified as held-for-sale. See Note 3 for information on a held-for-sale business. If a component of the Company has either been disposed of or is classified as held-for-sale and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results, the results of the component are reported in discontinued operations.\nSeparate Accounts\nSeparate accounts are established in conformity with insurance laws. Generally, the assets of the separate accounts cannot be used to settle the liabilities that arise from any other business of the Company. Separate account assets are subject to general account claims only to the extent the value of such assets exceeds the separate account liabilities. The Company reports separately, as assets and liabilities, investments held in separate accounts and liabilities of the separate accounts if:\n•\nsuch separate accounts are legally recognized;\n•\nassets supporting the contract liabilities are legally insulated from the Company’s general account liabilities;\n•\ninvestment objectives are directed by the contractholder; and\n•\nall investment performance, net of contract fees and assessments, is passed through to the contractholder.\n161\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nThe Company reports separate account assets at their fair value which is based on the estimated fair values of the underlying assets comprising the individual separate account portfolios. Investment performance (including investment income, net investment gains (losses) and changes in unrealized gains (losses)) and the corresponding amounts credited to contractholders of such separate accounts are offset within the same line on the statements of operations. Separate accounts credited with a contractual investment return are combined on a line-by-line basis with the Company’s general account assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the accounting for these investments is consistent with the methodologies described herein for similar financial instruments held within the general account. Unit-linked separate account investments that are directed by contractholders but do not meet one or more of the other above criteria are included in fair value option (“FVO”) securities (“FVO Securities”).\nThe Company’s revenues reflect fees charged to the separate accounts, including mortality charges, risk charges, policy administration fees, investment management fees and surrender charges. Such fees are included in universal life and investment-type product policy fees on the statements of operations.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe following are the Company’s significant accounting policies with references to notes providing additional information on such policies and critical accounting estimates relating to such policies.\nInsurance\nFuture Policy Benefit Liabilities and Policyholder Account Balances\nThe Company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies. Generally, amounts are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present value of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations, investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area. These assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business basis. For long duration insurance contracts, assumptions such as mortality, morbidity and interest rates are “locked in” upon the issuance of new business. However, significant adverse changes in experience on such contracts may require the establishment of premium deficiency reserves. Such reserves are determined based on the then current assumptions and do not include a provision for adverse deviation.\nPremium deficiency reserves may also be established for short-duration contracts to provide for expected future losses. These reserves are based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period, including losses incurred for which claims have not been reported. The provisions for unreported claims are calculated using studies that measure the historical length of time between the incurred date of a claim and its eventual reporting to the Company. Anticipated investment income is considered in the calculation of premium deficiency losses for short-duration contracts.\n162\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nLiabilities for universal and variable life policies with secondary guarantees (“ULSG”) and paid-up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the life of the contract based on total expected assessments. The assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid-up guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs (“DAC”), and are thus subject to the same variability and risk as further discussed herein. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of appropriate underlying equity indices, such as the S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) 500 Index. The benefits used in calculating the liabilities are based on the average benefits payable over a range of scenarios.\nThe Company regularly reviews its estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with its actual experience. Differences result in changes to the liability balances with related charges or credits to benefit expenses in the period in which the changes occur.\nPolicyholder account balances relate to contracts or contract features where the Company has no significant insurance risk\n.\nThe Company issues directly and assumes through reinsurance variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits that provide the policyholder a minimum return based on their initial deposit adjusted for withdrawals. These guarantees are accounted for as insurance liabilities or as embedded derivatives depending on how and when the benefit is paid. Specifically, a guarantee is accounted for as an embedded derivative if a guarantee is paid without requiring (i) the occurrence of a specific insurable event, or (ii) the policyholder to annuitize. Alternatively, a guarantee is accounted for as an insurance liability if the guarantee is paid only upon either (i) the occurrence of a specific insurable event, or (ii) annuitization. In certain cases, a guarantee may have elements of both an insurance liability and an embedded derivative and in such cases the guarantee is split and accounted for under both models.\nGuarantees accounted for as insurance liabilities in future policy benefits include guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDBs”), the life-contingent portion of guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWBs”), elective annuitizations of guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIBs”), and the life contingent portion of GMIBs that require annuitization when the account balance goes to zero.\nGuarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives in policyholder account balances include guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMABs”), the non-life contingent portion of GMWBs and certain non-life contingent portions of GMIBs. At inception, the Company attributes to the embedded derivative a portion of the projected future guarantee fees to be collected from the policyholder equal to the present value of projected future guaranteed benefits. Any additional fees represent “excess” fees and are reported in universal life and investment-type product policy fees.\nOther Policy-Related Balances\nOther policy-related balances include policy and contract claims, premiums received in advance, unearned revenue liabilities, obligations assumed under structured settlement assignments, policyholder dividends due and unpaid, policyholder dividends left on deposit and negative value of business acquired (“VOBA”).\nThe liability for policy and contract claims generally relates to incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) death, disability, dental and vision claims. In addition, included in other policy-related balances are claims which have been reported but not yet settled for death, disability and dental. The liability for these claims is based on the Company’s estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims. The Company derives estimates for the development of IBNR claims principally from analyses of historical patterns of claims by business line. The methods used to determine these estimates are continually reviewed. Adjustments resulting from this continuous review process and differences between estimates and payments for claims are recognized in policyholder benefits and claims expense in the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made.\nThe Company accounts for the prepayment of premiums on its individual life, group life and health contracts as premiums received in advance. These amounts are then recognized in premiums when due.\nThe unearned revenue liability relates to universal life and investment-type products and represents policy charges for services to be provided in future periods. The charges are deferred as unearned revenue and amortized using the product’s estimated gross profits and margins, similar to DAC as discussed further herein. Such amortization is recorded in universal life and investment-type product policy fees.\n163\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nSee “— Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs, Value of Business Acquired and Other Intangibles” for a discussion of negative VOBA.\nRecognition of Insurance Revenues and Deposits\nPremiums related to traditional life, annuity contracts with life contingencies, long-duration accident & health, and credit insurance policies are recognized as revenues when due from policyholders. Policyholder benefits and expenses are provided to recognize profits over the estimated lives of the insurance policies. When premiums are due over a significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits are provided, any excess profit is deferred and recognized into earnings in a constant relationship to insurance in-force or, for annuities, the amount of expected future policy benefit payments.\nPremiums related to short-duration non-medical health and disability, accident & health, and certain credit insurance contracts are recognized on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract term.\nDeposits related to universal life and investment-type products are credited to policyholder account balances. Revenues from such contracts consist of fees for mortality, policy administration and surrender charges and are recorded in universal life and investment-type product policy fees in the period in which services are provided. Amounts that are charged to earnings include interest credited and benefit claims incurred in excess of related policyholder account balances.\nPremiums related to property & casualty contracts are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract term. Unearned premiums, representing the portion of premium written related to the unexpired coverage, are included in future policy benefits.\nAll revenues and expenses are presented net of reinsurance, as applicable.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs, Value of Business Acquired and Other Intangibles\nThe Company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that are related directly to the successful acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts are capitalized as DAC. Such costs include:\n•\nincremental direct costs of contract acquisition, such as commissions;\n•\nthe portion of an employee’s total compensation and benefits related to time spent selling, underwriting or processing the issuance of new and renewal insurance business only with respect to actual policies acquired or renewed;\n•\nother essential direct costs that would not have been incurred had a policy not been acquired or renewed; and\n•\nthe costs of direct-response advertising, the primary purpose of which is to elicit sales to customers who could be shown to have responded specifically to the advertising and that results in probable future benefits.\nAll other acquisition-related costs, including those related to general advertising and solicitation, market research, agent training, product development, unsuccessful sales and underwriting efforts, as well as all indirect costs, are expensed as incurred.\nVOBA is an intangible asset resulting from a business combination that represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance, annuity, and investment-type contracts in-force at the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the acquired liabilities is based on projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, operating expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. Actual experience with the purchased business may vary from these projections.\n164\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nDAC and VOBA are amortized as follows:\nSee Note 5 for additional information on DAC and VOBA amortization. Amortization of DAC and VOBA is included in other expenses.\nThe recovery of DAC and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business. DAC and VOBA are aggregated on the financial statements for reporting purposes.\nThe Company generally has two different types of sales inducements which are included in other assets: (i) the policyholder receives a bonus whereby the policyholder’s initial account balance is increased by an amount equal to a specified percentage of the customer’s deposit; and (ii) the policyholder receives a higher interest rate using a dollar cost averaging method than would have been received based on the normal general account interest rate credited. The Company defers sales inducements and amortizes them over the life of the policy using the same methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC. The amortization of sales inducements is included in policyholder benefits and claims. Each year, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potential recoverability issue exists, the Company reviews deferred sales inducements (“DSI”) to determine the recoverability of the asset.\nValue of distribution agreements acquired (“VODA”) is reported in other assets and represents the present value of expected future profits associated with the expected future business derived from the distribution agreements acquired as part of a business combination. Value of customer relationships acquired (“VOCRA”) is also reported in other assets and represents the present value of the expected future profits associated with the expected future business acquired through existing customers of the acquired company or business. The VODA and VOCRA associated with past business combinations are amortized over the assets’ useful lives ranging from\nnine\nto\n40\nyears and such amortization is included in other expenses. Each year, or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment exists, the Company reviews VODA and VOCRA to determine whether the asset is impaired.\nFor certain acquired blocks of business, the estimated fair value of the in-force contract obligations exceeded the book value of assumed in-force insurance policy liabilities, resulting in negative VOBA, which is presented separately from VOBA as an additional insurance liability. The estimated fair value of the in-force contract obligations is based on projections by each block of business. Negative VOBA is amortized over the policy period in proportion to the approximate consumption of losses included in the liability usually expressed in terms of insurance in-force or account value. Such amortization is recorded as an offset in other expenses.\nReinsurance\nFor each of its reinsurance agreements, the Company determines whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Cessions under reinsurance agreements do not discharge the Company’s obligations as the primary insurer. The Company reviews all contractual features, including those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims.\n165\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nFor reinsurance of existing in-force blocks of long-duration contracts that transfer significant insurance risk, the difference, if any, between the amounts paid (received), and the liabilities ceded (assumed) related to the underlying contracts is considered the net cost of reinsurance at the inception of the reinsurance agreement. The net cost of reinsurance is amortized on a basis consistent with the methodologies and assumptions used for amortizing DAC related to the underlying reinsured contracts. Subsequent amounts paid (received) on the reinsurance of in-force blocks, as well as amounts paid (received) related to new business, are recorded as ceded (assumed) premiums; and ceded (assumed) premiums, reinsurance and other receivables (future policy benefits) are established.\nFor prospective reinsurance of short-duration contracts that meet the criteria for reinsurance accounting, amounts paid (received) are recorded as ceded (assumed) premiums and ceded (assumed) unearned premiums. Unearned premiums are reflected as a component of premiums, reinsurance and other receivables (future policy benefits). Such amounts are amortized through earned premiums over the remaining contract period in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided. For retroactive reinsurance of short-duration contracts that meet the criteria for reinsurance accounting, amounts paid (received) in excess of the related insurance liabilities ceded (assumed) are recognized immediately as a loss and are reported in the appropriate line item within the statement of operations. Any gain on such retroactive agreement is deferred and is amortized as part of DAC, primarily using the recovery method.\nAmounts currently recoverable under reinsurance agreements are included in premiums, reinsurance and other receivables and amounts currently payable are included in other liabilities. Assets and liabilities relating to reinsurance agreements with the same reinsurer may be recorded net on the balance sheet, if a right of offset exists within the reinsurance agreement. In the event that reinsurers do not meet their obligations to the Company under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, reinsurance recoverable balances could become uncollectible. In such instances, reinsurance recoverable balances are stated net of allowances for uncollectible reinsurance.\nPremiums, fees and policyholder benefits and claims include amounts assumed under reinsurance agreements and are net of reinsurance ceded. Amounts received from reinsurers for policy administration are reported in other revenues.\nIf the Company determines that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk, the Company records the agreement using the deposit method of accounting. Deposits received are included in other liabilities and deposits made are included within premiums, reinsurance and other receivables. As amounts are paid or received, consistent with the underlying contracts, the deposit assets or liabilities are adjusted. Interest on such deposits is recorded as other revenues or other expenses, as appropriate. Periodically, the Company evaluates the adequacy of the expected payments or recoveries and adjusts the deposit asset or liability through other revenues or other expenses, as appropriate.\nInvestments\nNet Investment Income and Net Investment Gains (Losses)\nIncome from investments is reported within net investment income, unless otherwise stated herein. Gains and losses on sales of investments, intent-to-sell impairments, as well as provisions for credit loss in the allowance for credit loss (“ACL”) on fixed maturity securities available-for-sale (“AFS”), mortgage loans and investments in leases and subsequent changes in the ACL or for impairment losses on real estate investments and other asset classes, are reported within net investment gains (losses), unless otherwise stated herein. Accrued investment income is presented separately on the consolidated balance sheet and excluded from the carrying value of the related investments, primarily fixed maturity securities AFS and mortgage loans.\nFixed Maturity Securities\nThe majority of the Company’s fixed maturity securities are classified as AFS and are reported at their estimated fair value. Unrealized investment gains and losses on these securities are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”), net of policy-related amounts and deferred income taxes. All security transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Sales of securities are determined on a specific identification basis.\n166\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nInterest income and prepayment fees are recognized when earned. Interest income is recognized using an effective yield method giving effect to amortization of premium and accretion of discount, and is based on the estimated economic life of the securities, which for mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities considers the estimated timing and amount of prepayments of the underlying loans. See Note 8 “— Fixed Maturity Securities AFS — Methodology for Amortization of Premium and Accretion of Discount on Structured Products.” The amortization of premium and accretion of discount also take into consideration call and maturity dates.\nThe Company periodically evaluates these securities for impairment. The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on management’s case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value as described in Note 8 “— Fixed Maturity Securities AFS — Evaluation of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS for Credit Loss.”\nPrior to January 1, 2020, the Company applied other than temporary impairment (“OTTI”) guidance for securities in an unrealized loss position. An OTTI was recognized in earnings within net investment gains (losses) when it was anticipated that the amortized cost would not be recovered. When either: (i) the Company had the intent to sell the security, or (ii) it was more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the security before recovery, the reduction of amortized cost and the OTTI recognized in earnings was the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost and estimated fair value. If neither of these conditions existed, the difference between the amortized cost of the security and the present value of projected future cash flows expected to be collected was recognized as a reduction of amortized cost and an OTTI in earnings. If the estimated fair value was less than the present value of projected future cash flows expected to be collected, this portion of OTTI related to other-than-credit factors was recorded in OCI.\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted accounting standards update (“ASU”) 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n(“ASU 2016-13”), using a modified retrospective approach. Under ASU 2016-13, for securities in an unrealized loss position, a credit loss is recognized in earnings within net investment gains (losses) when it is anticipated that the amortized cost will not be recovered. When either: (i) the Company has the intent to sell the security; or (ii) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery, the reduction of amortized cost and the loss recognized in earnings is the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost and estimated fair value. If neither of these conditions exists, the difference between the amortized cost of the security and the present value of projected future cash flows expected to be collected is recognized as a credit loss by establishing an ACL with a corresponding charge to earnings in net investment gains (losses). However, the ACL is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost. This limitation is known as the “fair value floor.” If the estimated fair value is less than the present value of projected future cash flows expected to be collected, this portion of the decline in value related to other-than-credit factors (“noncredit loss”) is recorded in OCI.\nThe new credit loss guidance also replaces the model for purchased credit impaired (“PCI”) fixed maturity securities AFS and financing receivables and requires the establishment of an ACL at acquisition, which is added to the purchase price to establish the initial amortized cost of the investment. Upon adoption, the replacement of the PCI model did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities are reported at their estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value included in net investment gains (losses). Sales of securities are determined on a specific identification basis. Dividends are recognized in net investment income when declared.\nContractholder-Directed Equity Securities and FVO Securities\nContractholder-directed equity securities and FVO Securities (collectively, “Unit-linked and FVO Securities”) are investments for which the FVO has been elected, or are otherwise required to be carried at estimated fair value, and include:\n167\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\n•\ncontractholder-directed investments supporting unit-linked variable annuity type liabilities (“Unit-linked investments”) which do not qualify for presentation and reporting as separate account summary total assets and liabilities. These investments are primarily equity securities (including mutual funds) and, to a lesser extent, fixed income investments and cash and cash equivalents. The investment returns on these investments inure to contractholders and are offset by a corresponding change in policyholder account balances through interest credited to policyholder account balances;\n•\nfixed maturity and equity securities held-for-investment by the general account to support asset and liability management strategies for certain insurance products and investments in certain separate accounts; and\n•\nsecurities held by consolidated securitization entities (“CSEs”).\nMortgage Loans\nASU 2016-13 requires an ACL based on expected lifetime credit loss on financing receivables carried at amortized cost, including, but not limited to, mortgage loans and leveraged and direct financing leases, as described in Note 8.\nThe Company disaggregates its mortgage loan investments into three portfolio segments: commercial, agricultural and residential. Also included in commercial mortgage loans are revolving line of credit loans collateralized by commercial properties. The accounting policies that are applicable to all portfolio segments are presented below and the accounting policies related to each of the portfolio segments are included in Note 8.\nMortgage loans are stated at unpaid principal balance, adjusted for any unamortized premium or discount, deferred fees or expenses, and are net of ACL. Interest income and prepayment fees are recognized when earned. Interest income is recognized using an effective yield method giving effect to amortization of premium and accretion of discount.\nThe Company ceases to accrue interest when the collection of interest is not considered probable, which is based on a current evaluation of the status of the borrower, including the number of days past due. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, uncollected past due accrued interest income that is considered uncollectible is charged-off against net investment income. Generally, the accrual of interest income resumes after all delinquent amounts are paid and management believes all future principal and interest payments will be collected. The Company records cash receipts on non-accruing loans in accordance with the loan agreement. The Company records charge-offs upon the realization of a credit loss, typically through foreclosure or after a decision is made to sell a loan, or for residential loans when, after considering the individual consumer’s financial status, management believes amounts are not collectible. Gain or loss upon charge-off is recorded, net of previously established ACL, in net investment gains (losses). Cash recoveries on principal amounts previously charged-off are generally recorded in net investment gains.\nAlso included in mortgage loans are residential mortgage loans for which the FVO was elected, and which are stated at estimated fair value. Changes in estimated fair value are recognized in net investment income.\nMortgage loans that were previously designated as held-for-investment, but now are designated as held-for-sale, are stated at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value.\nPolicy Loans\nPolicy loans are stated at unpaid principal balances. Interest income is recorded as earned using the contractual interest rate. Generally, accrued interest is capitalized on the policy’s anniversary date. Valuation allowances are not established for policy loans, as they are fully collateralized by the cash surrender value of the underlying insurance policies. Any unpaid principal and accrued interest are deducted from the cash surrender value or the death benefit prior to settlement of the insurance policy.\nReal Estate\nReal estate held-for-investment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset (typically\n20\nto\n55\nyears). Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases. The Company periodically reviews its real estate held-for-investment for impairment and tests for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Properties whose carrying values are greater than their undiscounted cash flows are written down to their estimated fair value, which is generally computed using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the underlying risks.\n168\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nReal estate for which the Company commits to a plan to sell within one year and actively markets in its current condition for a reasonable price in comparison to its estimated fair value is classified as held-for-sale. Real estate held-for-sale is stated at the lower of depreciated cost or estimated fair value less expected disposition costs and is not depreciated.\nReal Estate Joint Ventures and Other Limited Partnership Interests\nThe Company uses the equity method of accounting or the FVO for real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests (“investee”) when it has more than a minor ownership interest or more than a minor influence over the investee’s operations. The Company generally recognizes its share of the investee’s earnings in net investment income on a three-month lag in instances where the investee’s financial information is not sufficiently timely or when the investee’s reporting period differs from the Company’s reporting period.\nThe Company accounts for its interest in real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests in which it has virtually no influence over the investee’s operations at estimated fair value. Changes in estimated fair value of these investments are included in net investment gains (losses). Because of the nature and structure of these investments, they do not meet the characteristics of an equity security in accordance with applicable accounting standards.\nThe Company routinely evaluates its equity method investments for impairment. For equity method investees, the Company considers financial and other information provided by the investee, other known information and inherent risks in the underlying investments, as well as future capital commitments, in determining whether an impairment has occurred.\nShort-term Investments\nShort-term investments include highly liquid securities and other investments with remaining maturities of one year or less, but greater than three months, at the time of purchase. Securities included within short-term investments are stated at estimated fair value, while other investments included within short-term investments are stated at amortized cost less ACL, which approximates estimated fair value.\n169\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nOther Invested Assets\nOther invested assets consist principally of the following:\n•\nFreestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values which are described in “— Derivatives” below.\n•\nTax credit and renewable energy partnerships which derive a significant source of investment return in the form of income tax credits or other tax incentives. Where tax credits are guaranteed by a creditworthy third party, the investment is accounted for under the effective yield method. Otherwise, the investment is accounted for under the equity method. See Note 19.\n•\nAnnuities funding structured settlement claims represent annuities funding claims assumed by the Company in its capacity as a structured settlements assignment company. The annuities are stated at their contract value, which represents the present value of the future periodic claim payments to be provided. The net investment income recognized reflects the amortization of discount of the annuity at its implied effective interest rate.\n•\nDirect financing leases net investment is equal to the minimum lease payment receivables plus the unguaranteed residual value, less the unearned income, less ACL. Income is determined by applying the pre-tax internal rate of return to the investment balance. The Company regularly reviews its minimum lease payment receivables for credit loss and residual value for impairments. Certain direct financing leases are linked to inflation.\n•\nLeveraged leases net investment is equal to the minimum lease payment receivables plus the unguaranteed residual value, less the unearned income, less ACL and is recorded net of non-recourse debt. Income is determined by applying the leveraged lease’s estimated rate of return to the net investment in the lease in those periods in which the net investment at the beginning of the period is positive. Leveraged leases derive investment returns in part from their income tax treatment. The Company regularly reviews its minimum lease payment receivables for credit loss and residual value for impairments.\n•\nInvestments in operating joint ventures that engage in insurance underwriting activities are accounted for under the equity method.\n•\nInvestments in Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) common stock are carried at redemption value and are considered restricted investments until redeemed by the respective regional FHLBs.\n•\nFunds withheld represent a receivable for amounts contractually withheld by ceding companies in accordance with reinsurance agreements. The Company recognizes interest on funds withheld at rates defined by the terms of the agreement which may be contractually specified or directly related to the underlying investments.\nSecurities Lending, Repurchase Agreements and FHLB of Boston Advance Agreements\nThe Company accounts for securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements as financing arrangements and the associated liability is recorded at the amount of cash received. Income and expenses associated with securities lending transactions and repurchase agreements are reported as investment income and investment expense, respectively, within net investment income. While the collateral management practices are unique to the FHLB of Boston short-term advance agreements program, these transactions are accounted for, have collateral maintenance requirements and have restrictions on securities pledged similar to securities lending transactions.\nSecurities Lending\nThe Company enters into securities lending transactions, whereby blocks of securities are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. The Company obtains collateral at the inception of the loan, usually cash, in an amount generally equal to 102% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned, and maintains it at a level greater than or equal to 100% for the duration of the loan. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. The Company is liable to return to the counterparties the cash collateral received. Security collateral on deposit from counterparties in connection with securities lending transactions may not be sold or re-pledged, unless the counterparty is in default, and is not reflected on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company monitors the ratio of the collateral held to the estimated fair value of the securities loaned on a daily basis and additional collateral is obtained as necessary throughout the duration of the loan.\n170\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nRepurchase Agreements\nThe Company participates in short-term repurchase agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions. Under these agreements, the Company lends fixed maturity securities and receives cash as collateral in an amount generally equal to 85% to 100% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned at the inception of the transaction. The Company monitors the ratio of the collateral held to the estimated fair value of the securities loaned throughout the duration of the transaction and additional collateral is obtained as necessary. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee.\nFHLB of Boston Advance Agreements\nA subsidiary of the Company has entered into short-term advance agreements with the FHLB of Boston. Under these advance agreements, the subsidiary pledges fixed maturity securities AFS as collateral and receives cash, which is segregated and reinvested, primarily into fixed maturity securities AFS and cash equivalents. Securities pledged as collateral may not be sold or re-pledged by the transferee.\nDerivatives\nFreestanding Derivatives\nFreestanding derivatives are carried on the Company’s balance sheet either as assets within other invested assets or as liabilities within other liabilities at estimated fair value. The Company does not offset the estimated fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement.\nAccruals on derivatives are generally recorded in accrued investment income or within other liabilities. However, accruals that are not scheduled to settle within one year are included with the derivative’s carrying value in other invested assets or other liabilities.\nIf a derivative is not designated as an accounting hedge or its use in managing risk does not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative are reported in net derivative gains (losses) except as follows:\nHedge Accounting\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, the Company formally documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction, as well as its designation of the hedge. Hedge designation and financial statement presentation of changes in estimated fair value of the hedging derivatives are as follows:\n•\nFair value hedge\n- a hedge of the estimated fair value of a recognized asset or liability - in the same line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. The carrying value of the hedged recognized asset or liability is adjusted for changes in its estimated fair value due to the hedged risk.\n•\nCash flow hedge\n- a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability - in OCI and reclassified into the statement of operations when the Company’s earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the hedged item.\n•\nNet investment in a foreign operation (“NIFO”) hedge\n- in OCI, consistent with the translation adjustment for the hedged net investment in the foreign operation.\n171\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nThe changes in estimated fair values of the hedging derivatives are exclusive of any accruals that are separately reported on the statement of operations within interest income or interest expense to match the location of the hedged item. Accruals on derivatives in net investment hedges are recognized in OCI.\nIn its hedge documentation, the Company sets forth how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the designated risks related to the hedged item and sets forth the method that will be used to retrospectively and prospectively assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness. A derivative designated as a hedging instrument must be assessed as being highly effective in offsetting the designated risk of the hedged item. Hedge effectiveness is formally assessed at inception and at least quarterly throughout the life of the designated hedging relationship. Assessments of hedge effectiveness are also subject to interpretation and estimation and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income.\nThe Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when: (i) it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the estimated fair value or cash flows of a hedged item; (ii) the derivative expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised; (iii) it is no longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur; or (iv) the derivative is de-designated as a hedging instrument.\nWhen hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative is not highly effective in offsetting changes in the estimated fair value or cash flows of a hedged item, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized in net derivative gains (losses). The carrying value of the hedged recognized asset or liability under a fair value hedge is no longer adjusted for changes in its estimated fair value due to the hedged risk, and the cumulative adjustment to its carrying value is amortized into income over the remaining life of the hedged item. Provided the hedged forecasted transaction is still probable of occurring, the changes in estimated fair value of derivatives recorded in OCI related to discontinued cash flow hedges are released into the statement of operations when the Company’s earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the hedged item.\nWhen hedge accounting is discontinued because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transactions will occur on the anticipated date or within two months of that date, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized currently in net derivative gains (losses). Deferred gains and losses of a derivative recorded in OCI pursuant to the discontinued cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction that is no longer probable of occurring are recognized immediately in net investment gains (losses).\nIn all other situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative is carried at its estimated fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in its estimated fair value recognized in the current period as net derivative gains (losses).\nEmbedded Derivatives\nThe Company issues certain products, which include variable annuities, and investment contracts and is a party to certain reinsurance agreements that have embedded derivatives. The Company assesses each identified embedded derivative to determine whether it is required to be bifurcated. The embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for as a freestanding derivative if:\n•\nthe combined instrument is not accounted for in its entirety at estimated fair value with changes in estimated fair value recorded in earnings;\n•\nthe terms of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract; and\n•\na separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would qualify as a derivative instrument.\n172\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nSuch embedded derivatives are carried on the balance sheet at estimated fair value with the host contract and changes in their estimated fair value are generally reported in net derivative gains (losses). If the Company is unable to properly identify and measure an embedded derivative for separation from its host contract, the entire contract is carried on the balance sheet at estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized in the current period in net investment gains (losses) or net investment income. Additionally, the Company may elect to carry an entire contract on the balance sheet at estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized in the current period in net investment gains (losses) or net investment income if that contract contains an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation. At inception, the Company attributes to the embedded derivative a portion of the projected future guarantee fees to be collected from the policyholder equal to the present value of projected future guaranteed benefits. Any additional fees represent “excess” fees and are reported in universal life and investment-type product policy fees.\nFair Value\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In most cases, the exit price and the transaction (or entry) price will be the same at initial recognition.\nSubsequent to initial recognition, fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. When such unadjusted quoted prices are not available, estimated fair values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar but not identical assets or liabilities, or other observable inputs. If these inputs are not available, or observable inputs are not determinable, unobservable inputs and/or adjustments to observable inputs requiring management’s judgment are used to determine the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities.\nGoodwill\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2017-04,\nIntangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\n, using a prospective transition approach for goodwill impairment testing. Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from net assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and recognized. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of such net assets acquired, is not amortized, and is tested for impairment based on a fair value approach at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment testing during the third quarter based upon data as of the close of the second quarter. Goodwill associated with a business acquisition is not tested for impairment during the year the business is acquired unless there is a significant identified impairment event.\nThe impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment or a business one level below the operating segment, if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, the Company will consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying value of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable.\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates potential triggering events that may affect the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units to assess whether any goodwill impairment exists. Deteriorating or adverse market conditions for certain reporting units may have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units and could result in future impairments of goodwill.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nCertain subsidiaries of MetLife, Inc. sponsor defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans covering eligible employees. Measurement dates used for all of the subsidiaries’ defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans correspond with the fiscal year ends of sponsoring subsidiaries, which is December 31 for U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries.\n173\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nThe Company recognizes the funded status of each of its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation, which is the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) for pension benefits and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (“APBO”) for other postretirement benefits in other assets or other liabilities.\nActuarial gains and losses result from differences between each plan’s actual experience and the assumed experience on plan assets or PBO during a particular period and are recorded in accumulated OCI (“AOCI”). To the extent such gains and losses exceed 10% of the greater of the PBO or the estimated fair value of plan assets, the excess is amortized into net periodic benefit costs, generally over the average projected future service years of the active employees. In addition, prior service costs (credit) are recognized in AOCI at the time of the amendment and then amortized to net periodic benefit costs over the average projected future service years of the active employees.\nNet periodic benefit costs are determined using management’s estimates and actuarial assumptions and are comprised of service cost, interest cost, settlement and curtailment costs, expected return on plan assets, amortization of net actuarial (gains) losses, and amortization of prior service costs (credit). Fair value is used to determine the expected return on plan assets.\nThe subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution plans for substantially all U.S. employees under which a portion of employee contributions is matched. Applicable matching contributions are made each payroll period. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation cost for current matching contributions. As all contributions are transferred currently as earned to the defined contribution plans, no liability for matching contributions is recognized on the balance sheets.\nIncome Tax\nMetLife, Inc. and its includable life insurance and non-life insurance subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return in accordance with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Non-includable subsidiaries file either separate individual corporate tax returns or separate consolidated tax returns.\nThe Company’s accounting for income taxes represents management’s best estimate of various events and transactions.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse.\nThe realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets when management determines, based on available information, that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances. When making such determination, the Company considers many factors, including:\n•\nthe nature, frequency, and amount of cumulative financial reporting income and losses in recent years;\n•\nthe jurisdiction in which the deferred tax asset was generated;\n•\nthe length of time that carryforward can be utilized in the various taxing jurisdictions;\n•\nfuture taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards;\n•\nfuture reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;\n•\ntaxable income in prior carryback years; and\n•\ntax planning strategies.\nThe Company may be required to change its provision for income taxes when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances. Additionally, the effect of changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, is recognized in net income tax expense (benefit) in the period of change.\n174\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nThe Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded on the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits due to tax uncertainties that do not meet the threshold are included within other liabilities and are charged to earnings in the period that such determination is made.\nThe Company classifies interest recognized as interest expense and penalties recognized as a component of income tax expense.\nIn December 2017, H.R.1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“U.S. Tax Reform”) was signed into law. See Note 19 for additional information on U.S. Tax Reform and related Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”) provisional amounts.\nLitigation Contingencies\nThe Company is a defendant in a large number of litigation matters and is involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods. Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Except as otherwise disclosed in Note 21, legal costs are recognized as incurred. On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation, regulatory investigations and litigation-related contingencies to be reflected on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nOther Accounting Policies\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company grants certain employees and directors stock-based compensation awards under various plans, subject to vesting conditions. The Company recognizes compensation expense in an amount fixed at grant date or remeasured quarterly as described in Note 16. The Company generally recognizes this expense over the vesting period. However, the Company truncates the expense period to the date the employee attained age-and-service criteria to exercise or receive payment for the award regardless of continued employment. In such a case, the Company does not accelerate award exercise or payment timing. The Company also takes an estimation of forfeitures into account.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers highly liquid securities and other investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Securities included within cash equivalents are stated at estimated fair value, while other investments included within cash equivalents are stated at amortized cost which approximates estimated fair value.\nProperty, Equipment, Leasehold Improvements and Computer Software\nProperty, equipment and leasehold improvements, which are included in other assets, are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as appropriate. The estimated life is generally\n40\nyears for company occupied real estate property, from\none\nto\n25\nyears for leasehold improvements, and from\nthree\nto\nseven years\nfor all other property and equipment. The cost basis of the property, equipment and leasehold improvements wa\ns $\n2.8\nbillion and $\n2.7\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accumulated depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements was $\n1.5\nbillion and $\n1.4\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Related depreciation and amortization expense was $\n194\nmillion, $\n207\nmillion a\nnd $\n191\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nComputer software, which is included in other assets, is stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. Purchased software costs, as well as certain internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use computer software during the application development stage, are capitalized. Such costs are amortized over a\nfour\n-year period using the straight-line method. The cost basis of computer software was\n$\n3.7\nbillion\nand $\n3.4\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accumulated amortization of capitalized software was\n$\n2.5\nbillion at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n175\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nRelated amortization expense was $\n207\nmillion\n, $\n262\nmillion and $\n276\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nLeases\nThe Company, as lessee, has entered into various lease and sublease agreements for office space and equipment. At contract inception, the Company determines that an arrangement contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. For contracts that contain a lease, the Company recognizes the right-of-use (“ROU”) asset in Other assets and the lease liability in Other liabilities. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.\nROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are determined using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate based upon information available at commencement date to recognize the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets also include lease payments and excludes lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease and are included in the lease measurement when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.\nThe Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components and accounts for these items as a single lease component for all asset classes.\nThe majority of the Company’s leases and subleases are operating leases related to office space. The Company recognizes lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues primarily include fees related to service contracts from customers for prepaid legal plans, administrative services-only contracts, and investment management services. Substantially all of the revenue from the services is recognized over time as the applicable services are provided or are made available to the customers. The revenue recognized includes variable consideration to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. In addition to the service fees, other revenues also include certain stable value fees and other miscellaneous revenues. These fees and miscellaneous revenues are recognized as earned.\nPolicyholder Dividends\nPolicyholder dividends are approved annually by the insurance subsidiaries’ boards of directors. The aggregate amount of policyholder dividends is related to actual interest, mortality, morbidity and expense experience for the year, as well as management’s judgment as to the appropriate level of statutory surplus to be retained by the insurance subsidiaries.\nForeign Currency\nAssets, liabilities and operations of foreign affiliates and subsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of each entity. The determination of the functional currency is made based on the appropriate economic and management indicators. For most of the Company’s foreign operations, the local currency is the functional currency. For certain other foreign operations, such as Japan, the local currency and one or more other currencies qualify as functional currencies. Assets and liabilities of foreign affiliates and subsidiaries are translated from the functional currency to U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at each year-end and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the year. The resulting translation adjustments are charged or credited directly to OCI, net of applicable taxes. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, including the effect of re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities to the appropriate functional currency, are reported as part of net investment gains (losses) in the period in which they occur.\n176\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n1. Business, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)\nEarnings Per Common Share\nBasic earnings per common share are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares, or their equivalent, outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share include the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise or issuance of stock-based awards using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, exercise or issuance of stock-based awards is assumed to occur with the proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nChanges to GAAP are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) in the form of ASUs to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. The following tables provide a description of new ASUs issued by the FASB and the impact of the adoption on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nAdoption of New Accounting Pronouncements\nThe table below describes the impacts of the ASUs adopted by the Company, effective January 1, 2020.\n177\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n1.

ASUs issued but not yet adopted as of December 31, 2020 that are currently being assessed and may or may not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or disclosures are summarized in the table below.\n179\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n2. Segment Information\nMetLife is organized into\nfive\nsegments: U.S.; Asia; Latin America; EMEA; and MetLife Holdings.

Segment Information (continued)\nFinancial Measures and Segment Accounting Policies\nAdjusted earnings is used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is also the Company’s GAAP measure of segment performance and is reported below. Adjusted earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net income (loss). The Company believes the presentation of adjusted earnings, as the Company measures it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of its performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business.\nAdjusted earnings is defined as adjusted revenues less adjusted expenses, net of income tax.\nThe financial measures of adjusted revenues and adjusted expenses focus on the Company’s primary businesses principally by excluding the impact of market volatility, which could distort trends, and revenues and costs related to non-core products and certain entities required to be consolidated under GAAP. Also, these measures exclude results of discontinued operations under GAAP and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife but do not meet the discontinued operations criteria under GAAP and are referred to as divested businesses. Divested businesses also include the net impact of transactions with exited businesses that have been eliminated in consolidation under GAAP and costs relating to businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife that do not meet the criteria to be included in results of discontinued operations under GAAP. Adjusted revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses). Adjusted expenses also excludes goodwill impairments.\nThe following additional adjustments are made to revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating adjusted revenues:\n•\nUniversal life and investment-type product policy fees excludes the amortization of unearned revenue related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses) and certain variable annuity GMIB fees (“GMIB fees”);\n•\nNet investment income: (i) includes adjustments for earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, (ii) excludes post-tax adjusted earnings adjustments relating to insurance joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, (iii) excludes certain amounts related to contractholder-directed equity securities, (iv) excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are VIEs consolidated under GAAP and (v) includes distributions of profits from certain other limited partnership interests that were previously accounted for under the cost method, but are now accounted for at estimated fair value, where the change in estimated fair value is recognized in net investment gains (losses) under GAAP; and\n•\nOther revenues is adjusted for settlements of foreign currency earnings hedges and excludes fees received in association with services provided under transition service agreements (“TSA fees”).\n181\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n2. Segment Information (continued)\nThe following additional adjustments are made to expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating adjusted expenses:\n•\nPolicyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends excludes: (i) amortization of basis adjustments associated with de-designated fair value hedges of future policy benefits, (ii) changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (iii) inflation-indexed benefit adjustments associated with contracts backed by inflation-indexed investments and amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets and other pass through adjustments, (iv) benefits and hedging costs related to GMIBs (“GMIB costs”) and (v) market value adjustments associated with surrenders or terminations of contracts (“Market value adjustments”);\n•\nInterest credited to policyholder account balances includes adjustments for earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and excludes certain amounts related to net investment income earned on contractholder-directed equity securities;\n•\nAmortization of DAC and VOBA excludes amounts related to: (i) net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (ii) GMIB fees and GMIB costs and (iii) Market value adjustments;\n•\nAmortization of negative VOBA excludes amounts related to Market value adjustments;\n•\nInterest expense on debt excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are VIEs consolidated under GAAP; and\n•\nOther expenses excludes: (i) noncontrolling interests, (ii) implementation of new insurance regulatory requirements costs, and (iii) acquisition, integration and other costs. Other expenses includes TSA fees.\nAdjusted earnings also excludes the recognition of certain contingent assets and liabilities that could not be recognized at acquisition or adjusted for during the measurement period under GAAP business combination accounting guidance.\nThe tax impact of the adjustments mentioned above are calculated net of the U.S. or foreign statutory tax rate, which could differ from the Company’s effective tax rate. Additionally, the provision for income tax (expense) benefit also includes the impact related to the timing of certain tax credits, as well as certain tax reforms.\nSet forth in the tables below is certain financial information with respect to the Company’s segments, as well as Corporate & Other, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The segment accounting policies are the same as those used to prepare the Company’s consolidated financial statements, except for adjusted earnings adjustments as defined above. In addition, segment accounting policies include the method of capital allocation described below.\nEconomic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. The model applies statistics-based risk evaluation principles to the material risks to which the Company is exposed. These consistent risk principles include calibrating required economic capital shock factors to a specific confidence level and time horizon while applying an industry standard method for the inclusion of diversification benefits among risk types. The Company’s management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards.\nSegment net investment income is credited or charged based on the level of allocated equity; however, changes in allocated equity do not impact the Company’s consolidated net investment income, net income (loss) or adjusted earnings.\nNet investment income is based upon the actual results of each segment’s specifically identifiable investment portfolios adjusted for allocated equity. Other costs are allocated to each of the segments based upon: (i) a review of the nature of such costs; (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of employee compensation costs incurred by each segment; and (iii) cost estimates included in the Company’s product pricing.\n182\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n2.

Acquisition and Dispositions\nAcquisition\nAcquisition of Versant Health\nOn December 30, 2020, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Versant Health, Inc. (“Versant Health”), a managed vision care company, for $\n1.8\nbillion in an all-cash transaction. Versant Health owns the well-established marketplace brands, Davis Vision and Superior Vision.\nOf the purchase price, $\n323\nmillion and $\n95\nmillion was allocated to the fair value of tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, respectively, at the acquisition date. The tangible assets primarily included $\n189\nmillion of cash.\nAdditionally, $\n890\nmillion was allocated to goodwill, $\n790\nmillion was allocated to VOCRA, and $\n115\nmillion was allocated to other intangibles. The goodwill recorded includes the certain expected synergies, assembled workforce and other benefits that management believes will result from combining the operations of Versant Health with the operations of MetLife, including strengthening and differentiating the Company’s vision benefit offering, reported in the U.S. segment, with one of the industry’s broadest networks of providers and plan options. The value of VOCRA, included in other assets, reflects the estimated fair value of the expected future profits associated with Versant Health’s customer relationships acquired. VOCRA will be amortized over the assets’ useful lives ranging from\nnine\nto\n15\nyears.\n186\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n3. Acquisition and Dispositions (continued)\nThe allocated purchase price also included deferred tax liabilities of $\n217\nmillion, which are attributable to the intangible assets and liabilities, excluding goodwill, established at the acquisition date. No portion of goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nThe valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is preliminary and subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed. If additional information about the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed becomes available, the Company may further revise the preliminary purchase price allocation as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.\nTotal revenue of Versant Health represented less than\n2\n% of pro forma total revenue of MetLife for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 when evaluated as though the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.\nDispositions\nPending Disposition of Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company\nIn December 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its wholly-owned subsidiary, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “MetLife P&C”) to Farmers Group, Inc. for $\n3.9\nbillion in cash. In addition, the Company and the Farmers Exchanges have established a 10-year strategic partnership through which the Farmers Insurance Group will offer its personal line products on MetLife’s U.S. Group Benefits platform which will commence when the transaction closes. MetLife P&C results of operations are reported in the U.S. segment adjusted earnings through December 31, 2020. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021 and is subject to regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other closing conditions.\nThe pending disposition meets the criteria for held-for-sale accounting but does not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. As a result, the related assets and liabilities are included in the separate held-for-sale line items of the asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe following table summarizes the assets and liabilities held-for-sale at December 31, 2020:\n187\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n3.

Insurance (continued)\nGroup Long-Term Disability\nAverage Annual Percentage Payout\nThe following is supplementary information about average historical claims duration at December 31, 2020:\nSignificant Methodologies and Assumptions\nGroup Life - Term and Group Long-Term Disability incurred but not paid (“IBNP”) liabilities are developed using a combination of loss ratio and development methods. Claims in the course of settlement are then subtracted from the IBNP liabilities, resulting in the IBNR liabilities. The loss ratio method is used in the period in which the claims are neither sufficient nor credible. In developing the loss ratios, any material rate increases that could change the underlying premium without affecting the estimated incurred losses are taken into account. For periods where sufficient and credible claim data exists, the development method is used based on the claim triangles which categorize claims according to both the period in which they were incurred and the period in which they were paid, adjudicated or reported. The end result is a triangle of known data that is used to develop known completion ratios and factors. Claims paid are then subtracted from the estimated ultimate incurred claims to calculate the IBNP liability.\n196\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n4. Insurance (continued)\nAn expense liability is held for the future expenses associated with the payment of incurred but not yet paid claims (IBNR and pending). This is expressed as a percentage of the underlying claims liability and is based on past experience and the anticipated future expense structure.\nFor Group Life - Term and Group Long-Term Disability, first year incurred claims and allocated loss adjustment expenses increased in 2020 compared to the 2019 incurral year due to the growth in the size of the business.\nThere were no significant changes in methodologies for the year ended December 31, 2020. The assumptions used in calculating the unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for Group Life - Term and Group Long-Term Disability are updated annually to reflect emerging trends in claim experience.\nNo additional premiums or return premiums have been accrued as a result of the prior year development.\nLiabilities for Group Life - Term unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses are not discounted.\nThe liabilities for Group Long-Term Disability unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses were $\n6.0\nbillion at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. Using interest rates ranging from\n3\n% to\n8\n%, based on the incurral year, the total discount applied to these liabilities was $\n1.2\nbillion at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. The amount of interest accretion recognized was $\n452\nmillion, $\n470\nmillion and $\n509\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts were reflected in policyholder benefits and claims.\nFor Group Life - Term, claims were based upon individual death claims. For Group Long-Term Disability, claim frequency was determined by the number of reported claims as identified by a unique claim number assigned to individual claimants. Claim counts initially include claims that do not ultimately result in a liability. These claims are omitted from the claim counts once it is determined that there is no liability.\nThe incurred and paid claims disclosed for the Group Life - Term product includes activity related to the product’s continued protection feature; however, the associated actuarial reserve for future benefit obligations under this feature is excluded from the liability for unpaid claims.\nThe Group Long-Term Disability IBNR, included in the development tables above, was developed using discounted cash flows, and is presented on a discounted basis.\nAsia\nGroup Disability & Group Life\n197\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n4. Insurance (continued)\nAverage Annual Percentage Payout\nThe following is supplementary information about average historical claims duration at December 31, 2020:\nSignificant Methodologies and Assumptions\nThis business line consists of employer sponsored and industry sponsored Group Life and Group Disability risks.\nFor Group Life, the IBNR liability is determined by using the Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method, with factors derived by examining the experience of historical claims. A pending liability is also calculated for claims that have been reported but have not been paid. A claim eligibility ratio based on past experience is applied to the face amount of individual claims.\nFor Group Disability, the IBNR liability is calculated by applying a percentage to premiums in-force based on the expected delay as evidenced by the experience in the portfolio. The IBNR liability is then allocated back into different incurral years based on historical run-off patterns. As the benefit for this class of business is a regular series of payments, an additional reserve is required for the liability for ongoing benefit payments - claims in course of payment (“CICP”). The assumptions employed in the calculation of the CICP are adjusted for the Company’s own experience.\nAn expense liability is held for the future expenses associated with the payment of incurred but not yet paid claims. This is expressed as a percentage of the underlying claims liability and is based on past experience and the future expense structure.\nThere were no significant changes in methodologies for the year ended December 31, 2020. The assumptions used in calculating the unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for Group Disability and Group Life are updated annually to reflect emerging trends in claim experience.\nNo additional premiums or return premiums have been accrued as a result of the prior year development.\nThe liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses were $\n1.0\nbillion and $\n814\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts were discounted using interest rates ranging from\n1\n% to\n7\n%, based on the incurral year. The total discount applied to these liabilities was $\n68\nmillion and $\n52\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amount of interest accretion recognized was $\n24\nmillion, $\n20\nmillion and $\n19\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts were reflected in policyholder benefits and claims.\nThe Company tracks claim frequency by the number of reported claims as identified by a unique claim number assigned to individual claimants. Claim counts include claims that do not ultimately result in a liability. A liability is only established for those claims that are expected to result in a liability, based on historical factors.\n198\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n4.

Insurance (continued)\nSignificant Methodologies and Assumptions\nThe Latin America segment establishes liabilities for unpaid losses, which are equal to the accumulation of unpaid reported claims, plus an estimate for claims IBNR.\nIn general terms, for both the Protection Life and Protection Health products, the methodology for IBNR is the Bornhuetter-Ferguson Method, with factors derived by examining the experience of historical claims. In the more recent incurral months, the credibility is higher on expected loss ratios and lower on claims calculated using the experience-derived factors. The credibility grows for the factors as incurral months become older.\nFor Protection Health products, claim duration can be very long due to the multiple incidences that may occur over time for a single claim. The number of claims reported per year is based on the original claim occurrence date for each individual claim. Any subsequent claims that are considered part of the original claim occurrence are not counted as a new claim. For Protection Life products, claims are based upon individual death claims.\nThere were no significant changes in methodologies or assumptions for the year ended December 31, 2020. The assumptions used in calculating the unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for Protection Life and Protection Health are updated annually to reflect emerging trends in claim experience.\nNo additional premiums or return premiums have been accrued as a result of the prior year development.\nLiabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses were not discounted.\nFor Protection Life and Protection Health products, claim counts initially include claims that do not ultimately result in a liability. These claims are omitted from the claim counts once it is determined that there is no liability.\n201\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n4.

The latter category consisted primarily of guaranteed interest contracts (“GICs”). The average interest rate credited on these contracts was\n2.55\n% and\n2.92\n% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were\nno\ninvestment gains (losses) on transfers of assets from the general account to the separate accounts.\n203\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n5. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs, Value of Business Acquired and Other Intangibles\nSee Note 1 for a description of capitalized acquisition costs.\nNonparticipating and Non-Dividend-Paying Traditional Contracts\nThe Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to these contracts (term insurance, nonparticipating whole life insurance, traditional group life insurance, non-medical health insurance, and accident & health insurance) over the appropriate premium paying period in proportion to the actual and expected future gross premiums that were set at contract issue. The expected premiums are based upon the premium requirement of each policy and assumptions for mortality, morbidity, persistency and investment returns at policy issuance, or policy acquisition (as it relates to VOBA), include provisions for adverse deviation, and are consistent with the assumptions used to calculate future policyholder benefit liabilities. These assumptions are not revised after policy issuance or acquisition unless the DAC or VOBA balance is deemed to be unrecoverable from future expected profits. Absent a premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy issuance or acquisition is caused only by variability in premium volumes.\nParticipating, Dividend-Paying Traditional Contracts\nThe Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to these contracts over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future gross margins. The amortization includes interest based on rates in effect at inception or acquisition of the contracts. The future gross margins are dependent principally on investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, mortality, persistency, expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties and certain economic variables, such as inflation. For participating contracts within the closed block (dividend-paying traditional contracts) future gross margins are also dependent upon changes in the policyholder dividend obligation. See Note 7. Of these factors, the Company anticipates that investment returns, expenses, persistency and other factor changes, as well as policyholder dividend scales, are reasonably likely to impact significantly the rate of DAC and VOBA amortization. Each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated gross margins with the actual gross margins for that period. When the actual gross margins change from previously estimated gross margins, the cumulative DAC and VOBA amortization is re-estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to current operations. When actual gross margins exceed those previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization will increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the actual gross margins are below the previously estimated gross margins. Each reporting period, the Company also updates the actual amount of business in-force, which impacts expected future gross margins. When expected future gross margins are below those previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization will increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the expected future gross margins are above the previously estimated expected future gross margins. Each period, the Company also reviews the estimated gross margins for each block of business to determine the recoverability of DAC and VOBA balances.\nFixed and Variable Universal Life Contracts and Fixed and Variable Deferred Annuity Contracts\nThe Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to these contracts over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future gross profits. The amortization includes interest based on rates in effect at inception or acquisition of the contracts. The amount of future gross profits is dependent principally upon returns in excess of the amounts credited to policyholders, mortality, persistency, interest crediting rates, expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties, the effect of any hedges used and certain economic variables, such as inflation. Of these factors, the Company anticipates that investment returns, expenses and persistency are reasonably likely to significantly impact the rate of DAC and VOBA amortization. Each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated gross profits with the actual gross profits for that period. When the actual gross profits change from previously estimated gross profits, the cumulative DAC and VOBA amortization is re-estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to current operations. When actual gross profits exceed those previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization will increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the actual gross profits are below the previously estimated gross profits. Each reporting period, the Company also updates the actual amount of business remaining in-force, which impacts expected future gross profits. When expected future gross profits are below those previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization will increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the expected future gross profits are above the previously estimated expected future gross profits. Each period, the Company also reviews the estimated gross profits for each block of business to determine the recoverability of DAC and VOBA balances.\n204\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n5. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs, Value of Business Acquired and Other Intangibles (continued)\nCredit Insurance, Property and Casualty Insurance and Other Short-Duration Contracts\nThe Company amortizes DAC for these contracts, which is primarily composed of commissions and certain underwriting expenses, in proportion to actual and future earned premium over the applicable contract term.\nFactors Impacting Amortization\nSeparate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting period, which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of DAC and VOBA. Returns that are higher than the Company’s long-term expectation produce higher account balances, which increases the Company’s future fee expectations and decreases future benefit payment expectations on minimum death and living benefit guarantees, resulting in higher expected future gross profits. The opposite result occurs when returns are lower than the Company’s long-term expectation. The Company’s practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected. The Company monitors these events and only changes the assumption when its long-term expectation changes.\nThe Company also periodically reviews other long-term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits. These assumptions primarily relate to investment returns, policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates, mortality, persistency, policyholder behavior and expenses to administer business. Management annually updates assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed. If the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease.\nPeriodically, the Company modifies product benefits, features, rights or coverages that occur by the exchange of a contract for a new contract, or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by election or coverage within a contract. If such modification, referred to as an internal replacement, substantially changes the contract, the associated DAC or VOBA is written off immediately through income and any new deferrable costs associated with the replacement contract are deferred. If the modification does not substantially change the contract, the DAC or VOBA amortization on the original contract will continue and any acquisition costs associated with the related modification are expensed.\nAmortization of DAC and VOBA is attributed to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), and to other expenses for the amount of gross margins or profits originating from transactions other than investment gains and losses. Unrealized investment gains and losses represent the amount of DAC and VOBA that would have been amortized if such gains and losses had been recognized.\n205\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n5.

Reinsurance\nThe Company enters into reinsurance agreements primarily as a purchaser of reinsurance for its various insurance products and also as a provider of reinsurance for some insurance products issued by third parties.\nThe Company participates in reinsurance activities in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to significant risks and provide additional capacity for future growth.\n207\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n6. Reinsurance (continued)\nUnder the terms of the reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer agrees to reimburse the Company for the ceded amount in the event a claim is paid. Cessions under reinsurance agreements do not discharge the Company’s obligation as the primary insurer. In the event that reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, reinsurance recoverable balances could become uncollectible.\nAccounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks. The Company periodically reviews actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluates the financial strength of counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment process discussed in Note 8.\nU.S.\nFor its Group Benefits business, the Company generally retains most of the risk and only cedes particular risk on certain client arrangements. The majority of the Company’s reinsurance activity within this business relates to client agreements for employer sponsored captive programs, risk-sharing agreements and multinational pooling. The risks ceded under these agreements are generally quota shares of group life and disability policies. The cessions vary from 50% to 100% of all the risks of the policies.\nThe Company, through its Property & Casualty business, purchases reinsurance to manage its exposure to large losses (primarily catastrophe losses) and to protect statutory surplus. The Company cedes losses and premiums based upon the exposure of the policies subject to reinsurance. To manage exposure to large property & casualty losses, the Company purchases property catastrophe, casualty and property per risk excess of loss reinsurance protection.\nThe Company’s RIS business has engaged in reinsurance activities on an opportunistic basis. In 2020, a U.S. life insurance subsidiary of the Company began reinsuring longevity risks for certain pension products issued by unaffiliated providers located in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”).\nAsia, Latin America and EMEA\nFor selected large corporate clients, the Company reinsures group employee benefits or credit insurance business with various client-affiliated reinsurance companies, covering policies issued to the employees or customers of the clients. Additionally, the Company cedes and assumes risk with other insurance companies when either company requires a business partner with the appropriate local licensing to issue certain types of policies in certain jurisdictions. In these cases, the assuming company typically underwrites the risks, develops the products and assumes most or all of the risk. The Company also has reinsurance agreements in-force that reinsure a portion of the living and death benefit guarantees issued in connection with variable annuity products. Under these agreements, the Company pays reinsurance fees associated with the guarantees collected from policyholders, and receives reimbursement for benefits paid or accrued in excess of account values, subject to certain limitations. The Company may also reinsure certain risks with external reinsurers depending upon the nature of the risk and local regulatory requirements.\nMetLife Holdings\nFor its life products, the Company has historically reinsured the mortality risk primarily on an excess of retention basis or on a quota share basis. In addition to reinsuring mortality risk as described above, the Company reinsures other risks, as well as specific coverages. Placement of reinsurance is done primarily on an automatic basis and also on a facultative basis for risks with specified characteristics. The Company also assumes portions of the risk associated with certain whole life policies issued by a former affiliate and reinsures certain term life policies and universal life policies with secondary death benefit guarantees to such former affiliate.\nFor its other products, the Company has a reinsurance agreement in-force to reinsure the living and death benefit guarantees issued in connection with certain variable annuity guarantees from the Company’s former operating joint venture in Japan. Under this agreement, the Company receives reinsurance fees associated with the guarantees collected from policyholders, and provides reimbursement for benefits paid or accrued in excess of account values, subject to certain limitations.\n208\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n6. Reinsurance (continued)\nCatastrophe Coverage\nThe Company has exposure to catastrophes which could contribute to significant fluctuations in the Company’s results of operations. For the U.S. and EMEA, the Company purchases catastrophe coverage to reinsure risks issued within territories that the Company believes are subject to the greatest catastrophic risks. For its other segments, the Company uses excess of retention and quota share reinsurance agreements to provide greater diversification of risk and minimize exposure to larger risks. Excess of retention reinsurance agreements provide for a portion of a risk to remain with the direct writing company and quota share reinsurance agreements provide for the direct writing company to transfer a fixed percentage of all risks of a class of policies.\nReinsurance Recoverables\nThe Company reinsures its business through a diversified group of well-capitalized reinsurers. The Company analyzes recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes, if any, with its reinsurers. The Company monitors ratings and evaluates the financial strength of its reinsurers by analyzing their financial statements. In addition, the reinsurance recoverable balance due from each reinsurer is evaluated as part of the overall monitoring process. Recoverability of reinsurance recoverable balances is evaluated based on these analyses. The Company generally secures large reinsurance recoverable balances with various forms of collateral, including secured trusts, funds withheld accounts and irrevocable letters of credit. These reinsurance recoverable balances are stated net of allowances for uncollectible reinsurance, which at December 31, 2020 and 2019, were not significant. A U.S. life insurance subsidiary of the Company also secured collateral from its counterparties to mitigate counterparty default risk related to its longevity reinsurance agreements.\nThe Company has secured certain reinsurance recoverable balances with various forms of collateral, including secured trusts, funds withheld accounts and irrevocable letters of credit. The Company had $\n3.8\nbillion and $\n3.6\nbillion of unsecured reinsurance recoverable balances at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had $\n6.6\nbillion of net ceded reinsurance recoverables. Of this total, $\n4.2\nbillion, or\n64\n%, were with the Company’s five largest ceded reinsurers, including $\n2.0\nbillion of net ceded reinsurance recoverables which were unsecured. At December 31, 2019, the Company had $\n6.7\nbillion of net ceded reinsurance recoverables. Of this total, $\n4.3\nbillion, or\n64\n%, were with the Company’s five largest ceded reinsurers, including $\n1.7\nbillion of net ceded reinsurance recoverables which were unsecured.\nThe Company has reinsured with an unaffiliated third-party reinsurer,\n59.25\n% of the closed block through a modified coinsurance agreement. The Company accounts for this agreement under the deposit method of accounting. The Company, having the right of offset, has offset the modified coinsurance deposit with the deposit recoverable.\n209\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n6. Reinsurance (continued)\nThe amounts on the consolidated statements of operations include the impact of reinsurance.

Reinsurance (continued)\nReinsurance agreements that do not expose the Company to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk are recorded using the deposit method of accounting. The deposit assets on reinsurance were $\n1.8\nbillion and $\n2.5\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The deposit liabilities on reinsurance were $\n1.4\nbillion at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n7. Closed Block\nOn April 7, 2000 (the “Demutualization Date”), Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MLIC”) converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. The conversion was pursuant to an order by the New York Superintendent of Insurance approving MLIC’s plan of reorganization, as amended (the “Plan of Reorganization”). On the Demutualization Date, MLIC established a closed block for the benefit of holders of certain individual life insurance policies of MLIC. Assets have been allocated to the closed block in an amount that has been determined to produce cash flows which, together with anticipated revenues from the policies included in the closed block, are reasonably expected to be sufficient to support obligations and liabilities relating to these policies, including, but not limited to, provisions for the payment of claims and certain expenses and taxes, and to provide for the continuation of policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999, if the experience underlying such dividend scales continues, and for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience changes. At least annually, the Company compares actual and projected experience against the experience assumed in the then-current dividend scales. Dividend scales are adjusted periodically to give effect to changes in experience.\nThe closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed block assets and the anticipated revenues from the policies in the closed block will benefit only the holders of the policies in the closed block. To the extent that, over time, cash flows from the assets allocated to the closed block and claims and other experience related to the closed block are, in the aggregate, more or less favorable than what was assumed when the closed block was established, total dividends paid to closed block policyholders in the future may be greater than or less than the total dividends that would have been paid to these policyholders if the policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999 had been continued. Any cash flows in excess of amounts assumed will be available for distribution over time to closed block policyholders and will not be available to stockholders. If the closed block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from assets outside of the closed block. The closed block will continue in effect as long as any policy in the closed block remains in-force. The expected life of the closed block is over 100 years from the Demutualization Date.\nThe Company uses the same accounting principles to account for the participating policies included in the closed block as it used prior to the Demutualization Date. However, the Company establishes a policyholder dividend obligation for earnings that will be paid to policyholders as additional dividends as described below. The excess of closed block liabilities over closed block assets at the Demutualization Date (adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in AOCI) represents the estimated maximum future earnings from the closed block expected to result from operations, attributed net of income tax, to the closed block. Earnings of the closed block are recognized in income over the period the policies and contracts in the closed block remain in-force. Management believes that over time the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block will approximately equal the expected cumulative earnings due to the effect of dividend changes. If, over the period the closed block remains in existence, the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block are greater than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block, the Company will pay the excess to closed block policyholders as additional policyholder dividends unless offset by future unfavorable experience of the closed block and, accordingly, will recognize only the expected cumulative earnings in income with the excess recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. If over such period, the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block are less than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block, the Company will recognize only the actual earnings in income. However, the Company may change policyholder dividend scales in the future, which would be intended to increase future actual earnings until the actual cumulative earnings equal the expected cumulative earnings.\nExperience within the closed block, in particular mortality and investment yields, as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses, directly impact the policyholder dividend obligation. Amortization of the closed block DAC, which resides outside of the closed block, is based upon cumulative actual and expected earnings within the closed block. Accordingly, the Company’s net income continues to be sensitive to the actual performance of the closed block.\nClosed block assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are combined on a line-by-line basis with the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses outside the closed block based on the nature of the particular item.\n211\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n7.

MLIC also charges the closed block for expenses of maintaining the policies included in the closed block.\n8. Investments\nSee Note 10 for information about the fair value hierarchy for investments and the related valuation methodologies.\nInvestment Risks and Uncertainties\nInvestments are exposed to the following primary sources of risk: credit, interest rate, liquidity, market valuation, currency and real estate risk. The financial statement risks, stemming from such investment risks, are those associated with the determination of estimated fair values, the diminished ability to sell certain investments in times of strained market conditions, the recognition of ACL and impairments, the recognition of income on certain investments and the potential consolidation of VIEs. The use of different methodologies, assumptions and inputs relating to these financial statement risks may have a material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements.\nThe determination of ACL and impairments is highly subjective and is based upon quarterly evaluations and assessments of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nThe recognition of income on certain investments (e.g. structured securities, including mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities (“ABS”), certain structured investment transactions and FVO Securities) is dependent upon certain factors such as prepayments and defaults, and changes in such factors could result in changes in amounts to be earned.\nFixed Maturity Securities AFS\nFixed Maturity Securities AFS by Sector\nThe following table presents the fixed maturity securities AFS by sector. U.S. corporate and foreign corporate sectors include redeemable preferred stock. RMBS includes agency, prime, alternative and sub-prime mortgage-backed securities. ABS includes securities collateralized by corporate loans and consumer loans. Municipals includes taxable and tax-exempt revenue bonds and, to a much lesser extent, general obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions. Commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) primarily includes securities collateralized by multiple commercial mortgage loans. RMBS, ABS and CMBS are collectively, “Structured Products.” In accordance with new credit loss guidance adopted January 1, 2020, securities that incurred a credit loss after December 31, 2019 and were still held as of\n213\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n8.

See Note 3 for information on the pending disposition of MetLife P&C.\n(2)\nNoncredit OTTI losses included in AOCI in an unrealized gain position are due to increases in estimated fair value subsequent to initial recognition of noncredit losses on such securities. See also “— Net Unrealized Investment Gains (Losses).”\nMethodology for Amortization of Premium and Accretion of Discount on Structured Products\nAmortization of premium and accretion of discount on Structured Products considers the estimated timing and amount of prepayments of the underlying loans. Actual prepayment experience is periodically reviewed and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between the originally anticipated and the actual prepayments received and currently anticipated. Prepayment assumptions for Structured Products are estimated using inputs obtained from third-party specialists and based on management’s knowledge of the current market. For credit-sensitive and certain prepayment-sensitive Structured Products, the effective yield is recalculated on a prospective basis. For all other Structured Products, the effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis.\nMaturities of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS\nThe amortized cost, net of ACL, and estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities AFS, by contractual maturity date, were as follows at December 31, 2020:\nActual maturities may differ from contractual maturities due to the exercise of call or prepayment options. Fixed maturity securities AFS not due at a single maturity date have been presented in the year of final contractual maturity. Structured Products are shown separately, as they are not due at a single maturity.\n214\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n8.

Investments (continued)\nEvaluation of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS for Credit Loss\nEvaluation and Measurement Methodologies\nManagement considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent in management’s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Considerations used in the credit loss evaluation process include, but are not limited to: (i) the extent to which the estimated fair value has been below amortized cost, (ii) adverse conditions specifically related to a security, an industry sector or sub-sector, or an economically depressed geographic area, adverse change in the financial condition of the issuer of the security, changes in technology, discontinuance of a segment of the business that may affect future earnings, and changes in the quality of credit enhancement, (iii) payment structure of the security and likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments, (iv) failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest and principal payments, (v) whether the issuer, or series of issuers or an industry has suffered a catastrophic loss or has exhausted natural resources, (vi) whether the Company has the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell a particular security before the decline in estimated fair value below amortized cost recovers, (vii) with respect to Structured Products, changes in forecasted cash flows after considering the changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors and quality of underlying collateral, expected prepayment speeds, current and forecasted loss severity, consideration of the payment terms of the underlying assets backing a particular security, and the payment priority within the tranche structure of the security, (viii) changes in the rating of the security by a rating agency, and (ix) other subjective factors, including concentrations and information obtained from regulators.\nThe methodology and significant inputs used to determine the amount of credit loss are as follows:\n•\nThe Company calculates the recovery value by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the present value of future cash flows. The discount rate is generally the effective interest rate of the security at the time of purchase for fixed-rate securities and the spot rate at the date of evaluation of credit loss for floating-rate securities.\n•\nWhen determining collectability and the period over which value is expected to recover, the Company applies considerations utilized in its overall credit loss evaluation process which incorporates information regarding the specific security, fundamentals of the industry and geographic area in which the security issuer operates, and overall macroeconomic conditions. Projected future cash flows are estimated using assumptions derived from management’s single best estimate, the most likely outcome in a range of possible outcomes, after giving consideration to a variety of variables that include, but are not limited to: payment terms of the security; the likelihood that the issuer can service the interest and principal payments; the quality and amount of any credit enhancements; the security’s position within the capital structure of the issuer; possible corporate restructurings or asset sales by the issuer; any private and public sector programs to restructure foreign government securities and municipals; and changes to the rating of the security or the issuer by rating agencies.\n•\nAdditional considerations are made when assessing the unique features that apply to certain Structured Products including, but not limited to: the quality of underlying collateral, historical performance of the underlying loan obligors, historical rent and vacancy levels, changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors, expected prepayment speeds, current and forecasted loss severity, consideration of the payment terms of the underlying loans or assets backing a particular security, changes in the quality of credit enhancement and the payment priority within the tranche structure of the security.\nWith respect to securities that have attributes of debt and equity (“perpetual hybrid securities”), consideration is given in the credit loss analysis as to whether there has been any deterioration in the credit of the issuer and the likelihood of recovery in value of the securities that are in a severe unrealized loss position. Consideration is also given as to whether any perpetual hybrid securities with an unrealized loss, regardless of credit rating, have deferred any dividend payments.\nAfter the adoption of new credit loss guidance on January 1, 2020, in periods subsequent to the recognition of an initial ACL on a security, the Company reassesses credit loss quarterly. Subsequent increases or decreases in the expected cash flow from the security result in corresponding decreases or increases in the ACL which are recorded within net investment gains (losses); however, the previously recorded ACL is not reduced to an amount below zero. Full or partial write-offs are deducted from the ACL in the period the security, or a portion thereof, is considered uncollectible. Recoveries of amounts previously written off are recorded to the ACL in the period received. When the\n216\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n8. Investments (continued)\nCompany has the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, any ACL is written off and the amortized cost is written down to estimated fair value through a charge within net investment gains (losses), which becomes the new amortized cost of the security.\nIn accordance with the previous guidance, methodologies to evaluate the recoverability of a security in an unrealized loss position were similar, except: (i) the length of time estimated fair value had been below amortized cost was considered for securities, and (ii) for non-functional currency denominated securities, the impact from weakening non-functional currencies on securities that were near maturity was considered in the evaluation. In addition, measurement methodologies were similar, except: (i) a fair value floor was not utilized to limit the credit loss recognized, (ii) the amortized cost of securities was adjusted for the OTTI to the expected recoverable amount and an ACL was not utilized, (iii) subsequent to a credit loss being recognized, increases in expected cash flows from the security did not result in an immediate increase in valuation recognized in earnings through net investment gains (losses) from reduction of the ACL instead such increases in value were recorded as unrealized gains in OCI, and (iv) in periods subsequent to the recognition of OTTI on a security, the Company accounted for the impaired security as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of the impairment; accordingly, the discount (or reduced premium) based on the new cost basis was accreted over the remaining term of the security in a prospective manner based on the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows.\nEvaluation of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS in an Unrealized Loss Position\nGross unrealized losses on securities without an ACL decreased $\n215\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $\n1.4\nbillion primarily due to decreases in interest rates and movement in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by widening credit spreads.\nGross unrealized losses on securities without an ACL that have been in a continuous gross unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater were $\n401\nmillion at December 31, 2020, or\n28\n% of the total gross unrealized losses on securities without an ACL.\nInvestment Grade Fixed Maturity Securities AFS\nOf the $\n401\nmillion of gross unrealized losses on securities without an ACL that have been in a continuous gross unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater, $\n350\nmillion, or\n87\n%, were related to\n600\ninvestment grade securities. Unrealized losses on investment grade securities are principally related to widening credit spreads since purchase and, with respect to fixed-rate securities, rising interest rates since purchase.\nBelow Investment Grade Fixed Maturity Securities AFS\nOf the $\n401\nmillion of gross unrealized losses on securities without an ACL that have been in a continuous gross unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater, $\n51\nmillion, or\n13\n%, were related to\n90\nbelow investment grade securities. Unrealized losses on below investment grade securities are principally related to U.S. and foreign corporate securities (primarily industrial and consumer), foreign government securities and CMBS and are the result of significantly wider credit spreads resulting from higher risk premiums since purchase, largely due to economic and market uncertainty, as well as with respect to fixed-rate securities, rising interest rates since purchase. Management evaluates U.S. corporate and foreign corporate securities based on factors such as expected cash flows, financial condition and near-term and long-term prospects of the issuers. Management evaluates foreign government securities based on factors impacting the issuers such as expected cash flows, financial condition of the issuers and any country specific economic conditions or public sector programs to restructure foreign government securities. Management evaluates CMBS based on actual and projected cash flows after considering the quality of underlying collateral, credit enhancements, expected prepayment speeds, current and forecasted loss severity, the payment terms of the underlying assets backing a particular security and the payment priority within the tranche structure of the security.\nCurrent Period Evaluation\nAt December 31, 2020, with respect to securities in an unrealized loss position without an ACL, the Company did not intend to sell these securities, and it was not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell these securities before the anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost. Based on the Company’s current evaluation of its securities in an unrealized loss position without an ACL, the Company concluded that these securities had not incurred a credit loss and should not have an ACL at December 31, 2020.\n217\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n8. Investments (continued)\nFuture provisions for credit loss will depend primarily on economic fundamentals, issuer performance (including changes in the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected), changes in credit ratings and collateral valuation.\nRollforward of Allowance for Credit Loss for Fixed Maturity Securities AFS By Sector\nThe rollforward of ACL for fixed maturity securities AFS by sector for the year ended December 31, 2020 is as follows:\n________________\n(1)\nIn connection with the disposition of MetLife Seguros de Retiro, ACL was reduced by $\n11\nmillion. See Note 3.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities are summarized by security type as follows at:\nContractholder-Directed Equity Securities and FVO Securities\nAs described more fully in Note 1, Unit-linked and FVO Securities include three categories of investments for which the FVO has been elected, or are otherwise required to be carried at estimated fair value.\n218\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n8. Investments (continued)\nMortgage Loans\nMortgage Loans by Portfolio Segment\nMortgage loans are summarized as follows at:\nThe Company elects the FVO for certain residential mortgage loans that are managed on a total return basis. See Note 10 for further information.\nThe amount of net discounts, included within total amortized cost, primarily attributable to residential mortgage loans was $\n944\nmillion and $\n867\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The accrued interest income excluded from total amortized cost for commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $\n209\nmillion and $\n188\nmillion; $\n174\nmillion and $\n186\nmillion; and $\n108\nmillion and $\n94\nmillion, respectively.\nPurchases of mortgage loans, primarily residential, were $\n3.3\nbillion, $\n4.8\nbillion and $\n3.5\nbillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAllowance for Credit Loss Rollforward by Portfolio Segment\nThe changes in the ACL, by portfolio segment, were as follows:\n__________________\n(1)\nRepresents the initial credit losses on purchased mortgage loans accounted for as purchased financial assets with credit deterioration (“PCD”)\n.\n219\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n8. Investments (continued)\nAllowance for Credit Loss Methodology\nAfter the adoption of new credit loss guidance on January 1, 2020, the Company records an allowance for expected lifetime credit loss in an amount that represents the portion of the amortized cost basis of mortgage loans that the Company does not expect to collect, resulting in mortgage loans being presented at the net amount expected to be collected. In determining the Company’s ACL, management: (i) pools mortgage loans that share similar risk characteristics, (ii) considers expected lifetime credit loss over the contractual term of its mortgage loans adjusted for expected prepayments and any extensions, and (iii) considers past events and current and forecasted economic conditions. Each of the Company’s commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loan portfolio segments are evaluated separately. The ACL is calculated for each mortgage loan portfolio segment based on inputs unique to each loan portfolio segment. On a quarterly basis, mortgage loans within a portfolio segment that share similar risk characteristics, such as internal risk ratings or consumer credit scores, are pooled for calculation of ACL. On an ongoing basis, mortgage loans with dissimilar risk characteristics (i.e., loans with significant declines in credit quality), collateral dependent mortgage loans (i.e., when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, including when foreclosure is reasonably possible or probable) and reasonably expected troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) (i.e., the Company grants concessions to borrower that is experiencing financial difficulties) are evaluated individually for credit loss. The ACL for loans evaluated individually are established using the same methodologies for all three portfolio segments. For example, the ACL for a collateral dependent loan is established as the excess of amortized cost over the estimated fair value of the loan’s underlying collateral, less selling cost when foreclosure is probable. Accordingly, the change in the estimated fair value of collateral dependent loans, which are evaluated individually for credit loss, is recorded as a change in the ACL which is recorded on a quarterly basis as a charge or credit to earnings in net investment gains (losses).\nIn accordance with the previous guidance, evaluation and measurement methodologies in determining the ACL were similar, except: (i) credit loss was recognized when incurred (when it was probable, based on current information and events, that all amounts due under the loan agreement would not be collected), (ii) pooling of loans with similar risk characteristics was permitted, but not required, (iii) forecasts of economic conditions were not considered in the evaluation, (iv) measurement of the expected lifetime credit loss over the contractual term, or expected term, was not considered in the measurement, and (v) the credit loss for loans evaluated individually could also be determined using either discounted cash flows using the loans’ original effective interest rate or observable market prices.\n220\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n8. Investments (continued)\nCommercial and Agricultural Mortgage Loan Portfolio Segments\nCommercial and agricultural mortgage loan ACL are calculated in a similar manner. Within each loan portfolio segment, commercial and agricultural, loans are pooled by internal risk rating. Estimated lifetime loss rates, which vary by internal risk rating, are applied to the amortized cost of each loan, excluding accrued investment income, on a quarterly basis to develop the ACL. Internal risk ratings are based on an assessment of the loan’s credit quality, which can change over time. The estimated lifetime loss rates are based on several loan portfolio segment-specific factors, including (i) the Company’s experience with defaults and loss severity, (ii) expected default and loss severity over the forecast period, (iii) current and forecasted economic conditions including growth, inflation, interest rates and unemployment levels, (iv) loan specific characteristics including loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios, and (v) internal risk ratings. These evaluations are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. The Company uses its several decades of historical default and loss severity experience which capture multiple economic cycles. The Company uses a forecast of economic assumptions for a two-year period for most of its commercial and agricultural mortgage loans, while a one-year period is used for loans originated in certain markets. After the applicable forecast period, the Company reverts to its historical loss experience using a straight-line basis over two years. For evaluations of commercial mortgage loans, in addition to historical experience, management considers factors that include the impact of a rapid change to the economy, which may not be reflected in the loan portfolio, recent loss and recovery trend experience as compared to historical loss and recovery experience, and loan specific characteristics including debt service coverage ratios (“DSCR”). In estimating expected lifetime credit loss over the term of its commercial mortgage loans, the Company adjusts for expected prepayment and extension experience during the forecast period using historical prepayment and extension experience considering the expected position in the economic cycle and the loan profile (i.e., floating rate, shorter-term fixed rate and longer-term fixed rate) and after the forecast period using long-term historical prepayment experience. For evaluations of agricultural mortgage loans, in addition to historical experience, management considers factors that include increased stress in certain sectors, which may be evidenced by higher delinquency rates, or a change in the number of higher risk loans. In estimating expected lifetime credit loss over the term of its agricultural mortgage loans, the Company’s experience is much less sensitive to the position in the economic cycle and by loan profile; accordingly, historical prepayment experience is used, while extension terms are not prevalent with the Company’s agricultural mortgage loans.\nCommercial mortgage loans are reviewed on an ongoing basis, which review includes, but is not limited to, an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, LTV ratios, DSCR and tenant creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans, which include those that are classified as restructured, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher LTV ratios and lower DSCR. Agricultural mortgage loans are reviewed on an ongoing basis, which review includes, but is not limited to, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, LTV ratios and borrower creditworthiness, as well as reviews on a geographic and property-type basis. The monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loans also focuses on higher risk loans.\nFor commercial mortgage loans, the primary credit quality indicator is the DSCR, which compares a property’s net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan. Generally, the lower the DSCR, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. The Company also reviews the LTV ratio of its commercial mortgage loan portfolio. LTV ratios compare the unpaid principal balance of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. Generally, the higher the LTV ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. The DSCR and the values utilized in calculating the ratio are updated routinely. In addition, the LTV ratio is routinely updated for all but the lowest risk loans as part of the Company’s ongoing review of its commercial mortgage loan portfolio.\nFor agricultural mortgage loans, the Company’s primary credit quality indicator is the LTV ratio. The values utilized in calculating this ratio are developed in connection with the ongoing review of the agricultural mortgage loan portfolio and are routinely updated.\nCommitments to lend: After loans are approved, the Company makes commitments to lend and, typically, borrowers draw down on some or all of the commitments. The timing of mortgage loan funding is based on the commitment expiration dates. A liability for credit loss for unfunded commercial and agricultural mortgage loan commitments is recorded within net investment gains (losses). The liability is based on estimated lifetime loss rates as described above and the amount of the outstanding commitments, which for lines of credit, considers estimated utilization rates. When the commitment is funded or expires, the liability is adjusted accordingly.\n221\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n8. Investments (continued)\nResidential Mortgage Loan Portfolio Segment\nThe Company’s residential mortgage loan portfolio is comprised primarily of purchased closed end, amortizing residential mortgage loans, including both performing loans purchased within 12 months of origination and reperforming loans purchased after they have been performing for at least 12 months post-modification. Residential mortgage loans are pooled by loan type (i.e., new origination and reperforming) and pooled by similar risk profiles (including consumer credit score and LTV ratios). Estimated lifetime loss rates, which vary by loan type and risk profile, are applied to the amortized cost of each loan excluding accrued investment income on a quarterly basis to develop the ACL. The estimated lifetime loss rates are based on several factors, including (i) industry historical experience and expected results over the forecast period for defaults, (ii) loss severity, (iii) prepayment rates, (iv) current and forecasted economic conditions including growth, inflation, interest rates and unemployment levels, and (v) loan pool specific characteristics including consumer credit scores, LTV ratios, payment history and home prices. These evaluations are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. The Company uses industry historical experience which captures multiple economic cycles as the Company has purchased most of its residential mortgage loans in the last five years. The Company uses a forecast of economic assumptions for a two-year period for most of its residential mortgage loans. After the applicable forecast period, the Company immediately reverts to industry historical loss experience.\nFor residential mortgage loans, the Company’s primary credit quality indicator is whether the loan is performing or nonperforming. The Company generally defines nonperforming residential mortgage loans as those that are 60 or more days past due and/or in nonaccrual status which is assessed monthly. Generally, nonperforming residential mortgage loans have a higher risk of experiencing a credit loss.\nMortgage Loan Concessions\nIn response to the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, during 2020 the Company granted concessions to certain of its commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loan borrowers, including payment deferrals and other loan modifications. The Company has elected the option under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 and the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised) (“Interagency Statement”) issued by bank regulatory agencies, not to account for or report qualifying concessions as TDRs and not to classify such loans as either past due or nonaccrual during the payment deferral period. Additionally, in accordance with the FASB’s published response to a COVID-19 Pandemic technical inquiry, the Company continues to accrue interest income on such loans that have deferred payment. The Company records an ACL on this accrued interest income.\nCommercial\nFor some commercial mortgage loan borrowers (principally in the retail and hotel sectors), the Company granted concessions which were primarily interest and principal payment deferrals generally ranging from three to four months and, to a much lesser extent, maturity date extensions.\nDeferred commercial mortgage loan interest and principal payments were $\n66\nmillion at December 31, 2020.\nAgricultural\nFor some agricultural mortgage loan borrowers (principally in the annual crops and agribusiness sectors), the Company granted concessions which were primarily principal payment deferrals generally ranging from three to 12 months, and covenant changes and, to a much lesser extent, maturity date extensions.\nDeferred agricultural mortgage loan interest and principal payments were $\n6\nmillion at December 31, 2020.\nResidential\nFor some residential mortgage loan borrowers, the Company granted concessions which were primarily three-month interest and principal payment deferrals.\nDeferred residential mortgage loan interest and principal payments were $\n37\nmillion at December 31, 2020.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nThe Company assesses loan concessions prior to the issuance of, or outside the scope of, the CARES Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 and the Interagency Statement on a case-by-case basis to evaluate whether a TDR has occurred. The Company may grant concessions to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties which, if not\n222\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n8. Investments (continued)\nsignificant, are not classified as TDRs, while more significant concessions are classified as TDRs. Generally, the types of concessions include: reduction of the contractual interest rate, extension of the maturity date at an interest rate lower than current market interest rates, and/or a reduction of accrued interest. The amount, timing and extent of the concessions granted are considered in determining any ACL recorded.\nFor both years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have commercial mortgage loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not have a significant amount of agricultural mortgage loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had\nthree\nagricultural mortgage loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring with carrying value of $\n111\nmillion for both pre-modification and post-modification.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not have a significant amount of residential mortgage loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had\n396\nresidential mortgage loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring with carrying value of $\n97\nmillion and $\n87\nmillion pre-modification and post-modification, respectively.\nFor both years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have a significant amount of mortgage loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring with subsequent payment default.\nCredit Quality of Mortgage Loans by Portfolio Segment\nThe amortized cost of commercial mortgage loans by credit quality indicator and vintage year was as follows at December 31, 2020:\nThe amortized cost of agricultural mortgage loans by credit quality indicator and vintage year was as follows at December 31, 2020:\n223\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n8. Investments (continued)\nThe amortized cost of residential mortgage loans by credit quality indicator and vintage year was as follows at December 31, 2020:\n__________________\n(1)\nIncludes residential mortgage loans in process of foreclosure of $\n103\nmillion and $\n118\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nLTV ratios compare the unpaid principal balance of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. At December 31, 2020, the amortized cost of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans with a LTV ratio in excess of 100% was $\n650\nmillion, or less than\n1\n% of total commercial and agricultural mortgage loans, however after considering the reduction in carrying value from the related ACL,\nno\nloans have a ratio greater than 100%.\nPast Due and Nonaccrual Mortgage Loans\nThe Company has a high quality, well performing mortgage loan portfolio, with\n99\n% of all mortgage loans classified as performing at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe Company defines delinquency consistent with industry practice, when mortgage loans are past due more than two or more months, as applicable, by portfolio segment.\nThe past due and nonaccrual mortgage loans at amortized cost, prior to ACL, by portfolio segment, were as follows:\nThe amortized cost for nonaccrual commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loans at beginning of year 2019 was $\n176\nmillion, $\n105\nmillion and $\n436\nmillion, respectively. The amortized cost for nonaccrual commercial mortgage loans with no ACL was $\n168\nmillion and $\n0\nat December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The amortized cost for nonaccrual agricultural mortgage loans with no ACL was $\n178\nmillion and $\n93\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. There were\nno\nnonaccrual residential mortgage loans without an ACL at either December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019\n.\nPurchased Investments with Credit Deterioration\nInvestments that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination are classified as PCD. The amortized cost for PCD investments is the purchase price plus an ACL for the initial estimate of expected lifetime credit losses established upon purchase. Subsequent changes in the ACL on PCD investments are recorded in net investment gains (losses). The non-credit discount or premium is accreted or amortized to net investment income on an effective yield basis.\n224\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n8. Investments (continued)\nThe following table reconciles the contractual principal to the purchase price of PCD investments:\nPrior to the adoption of new credit loss guidance for the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments, the Company applied applicable guidance for investments acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination, known as PCI investments. The Company’s PCI investments had an outstanding principal balance of $\n3.3\nbillion at December 31, 2019, which represents the contractually required principal and accrued interest payments whether or not currently due and a carrying value (estimated fair value of the investments plus accrued interest) of $\n2.7\nbillion at December 31, 2019. Accretion of accretable yield on PCI investments recognized in net investment income was $\n178\nmillion and $\n275\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nReal Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures\nThe Company’s real estate investment portfolio is diversified by property type, geography and income stream, including income from operating leases, operating income and equity in earnings from equity method real estate joint ventures.\nReal estate investments, by income type, as well as income earned, were as follows at and for the periods indicated:\nThe carrying value of real estate investments acquired through foreclosure was $\n20\nmillion and $\n36\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Depreciation expense on real estate investments was $\n123\nmillion, $\n100\nmillion and $\n92\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Real estate investments were net of accumulated depreciation of $\n1.1\nbillion and $\n957\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, earnings from certain of the Company’s equity method real estate joint ventures were reduced for the year ended December 31, 2020, principally hotel properties. Certain of these real estate joint ventures have granted some lessees COVID-19 Pandemic-related lease concessions. See “— Leases — Lease Concessions.”\nLeases\nLeased Real Estate Investments - Operating Leases\nThe Company, as lessor, leases investment real estate, principally commercial real estate for office and retail use, through a variety of operating lease arrangements, which typically include tenant reimbursement for property operating costs and options to renew or extend the lease. In some circumstances, leases may include an option for the lessee to purchase the property. In addition, certain leases of retail space may stipulate that a portion of the income earned is contingent upon the level of the tenants’ revenues.\nThe Company has elected a practical expedient of not separating non-lease components related to reimbursement of property operating costs from associated lease components. These property operating costs have the same timing and pattern of transfer as the related lease component, because they are incurred over the same period of time as the operating lease. Therefore, the combined component is accounted for as a single operating lease.\nRisk is managed through lessee credit analysis, property type diversification, and geographic diversification.\nLeased real estate investments and income earned, by property type, were as follows at and for the periods indicated:\n225\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n8. Investments (continued)\nFuture contractual receipts under operating leases at December 31, 2020 were $\n331\nmillion in 2021, $\n268\nmillion in 2022, $\n230\nmillion in 2023, $\n200\nmillion in 2024, $\n180\nmillion in 2025, $\n1.2\nbillion thereafter and, in total, are $\n2.4\nbillion.\nLeveraged and Direct Financing Leases\nThe Company has diversified leveraged lease and direct financing lease portfolios. Its leveraged leases principally include renewable energy generation facilities, rail cars, commercial real estate and commercial aircraft, and its direct financing leases principally include commercial real estate. These assets are leased through a variety of lease arrangements, which may include options to renew or extend the lease and options for the lessee to purchase the property. Residual values are estimated using available third-party data at inception of the lease. Risk is managed through lessee credit analysis, asset allocation, geographic diversification, and ongoing reviews of estimated residual values, using available third-party data and, in certain leases, linking the amount of future rental receipts to changes in inflation rates. Generally, estimated residual values are not guaranteed by the lessee or a third party.\nInvestment in leveraged and direct financing leases consisted of the following at:\n__________________\n(1)\nFuture contractual receipts under direct financing leases at December 31, 2020 were $\n27\nmillion in 2021, $\n103\nmillion in 2022, $\n112\nmillion in 2023, $\n119\nmillion in 2024, $\n102\nmillion in 2025, $\n1.6\nbillion thereafter and, in total $\n2.1\nbillion.\nLease receivables are generally due in periodic installments.\nThe payment periods for leveraged leases generally range from one to 11 years but in certain circumstances can be over 11 years, while the payment periods for direct financing leases generally range from one to 25 years but in certain circumstances can be over 25 years.\nFor lease receivables, the\n226\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n8. Investments (continued)\nprimary credit quality indicator is whether the lease receivable is performing or nonperforming, which is assessed monthly. The Company generally defines nonperforming lease receivables as those that are 90 days or more past due. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, all leveraged lease receivables were performing. At December 31, 2020 and 2019,\n96\n% and\n94\n% of direct financing lease receivables were performing, respectively.\nThe deferred income tax liability related to leveraged leases was $\n287\nmillion and $\n467\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe components of income from investment in leveraged and direct financing leases, excluding net investment gains (losses), were as follows:\nIn accordance with new credit loss guidance adopted January 1, 2020, the Company records an allowance for expected lifetime credit loss in an amount that represents the portion of the investment in leases that the Company does not expect to collect, resulting in the investment in leases being presented at the net amount expected to be collected. In determining the ACL, management: (i) pools leases that share similar risk characteristics, (ii) considers expected lifetime credit loss over the contractual term of the lease, and (iii) considers past events and current and forecasted economic conditions. Leases with dissimilar risk characteristics are evaluated individually for credit loss. Expected lifetime credit loss on leveraged lease receivables is estimated using a probability of default and loss given default model, where the probability of default incorporates third party credit ratings of the lessee and the related historical default data. Direct financing leases principally relate to leases of commercial real estate; accordingly, expected lifetime credit loss is estimated on such lease receivables consistent with the methodology for commercial mortgage loans (see “— Mortgage Loans — Allowance for Credit Loss Methodology”). The Company also assesses the non-guaranteed residual values for recoverability by comparison to the current estimated fair value of the leased asset and considers other relevant market information such as independent third-party forecasts, consulting, asset brokerage and investment banking reports and data, comparable market transactions, and factors such as the competitive dynamics impacting specific industries, technological change and obsolescence, government and regulatory rules, tax policy, potential environmental liabilities and litigation.\nPrior to the adoption of the new credit loss guidance, lease impairment losses were recorded as incurred. Under the incurred loss model, if all amounts due under the lease agreement would not be collected based on current information and events, an impairment loss was recorded. The impairment loss was recorded as a reduction of the investment in lease and within net investment gains (losses).\nLease Concessions\nIn response to the adverse economic impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Company granted concessions to certain of its lessees (operating and direct financing leases), primarily in the form of rent deferrals. In accordance with a Question and Answer document issued by the FASB in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Company has elected not to evaluate whether such lease concessions are lease modifications, continues to accrue income on such leases and records rent receivables on real estate operating leases. The rent deferrals generally range from one to six months for operating leases and three to six months for commercial real estate direct financing leases.\nDeferred rental payments and rental abatements for both operating and direct financing leases were $\n15\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2020. The Company has interests in certain unconsolidated real estate joint ventures which have granted COVID-19 Pandemic-related lease concessions.\n227\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n8.

The portion of these investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of $\n17.9\nbillion at December 31, 2020. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss related to these equity method investments is limited to the carrying value of these investments plus unfunded commitments of $\n8.0\nbillion at December 31, 2020. Except for certain real estate joint ventures and certain funds, the Company’s investments in its remaining real estate funds and other limited partnership interests are generally of a passive nature in that the Company does not participate in the management of the entities.\nAs described in Note 1, the Company generally records its share of earnings in its equity method investments using a three-month lag methodology and within net investment income.\nAggregate net investment income from these equity method investments exceeded\n10\n%\nof the Company’s consolidated pre-tax income (loss) for two of the three most recent annual periods: 2020 and 2019.\nThe following aggregated summarized financial data reflects the latest available financial information and does not represent the Company’s proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, or earnings of such entities. Aggregate total assets of these entities totaled $\n704.5\nbillion and $\n585.3\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Aggregate total liabilities of these entities totaled $\n99.4\nbillion and $\n86.1\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Aggregate net income (loss) of these entities totaled $\n41.6\nbillion, $\n47.0\nbillion and $\n52.5\nbillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Aggregate net income (loss) from the underlying entities in which the Company invests is primarily comprised of investment income, including recurring investment income and realized and unrealized investment gains (losses).\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company has invested in legal entities that are VIEs. In certain instances, the Company holds both the power to direct the most significant activities of the entity, as well as an economic interest in the entity and, as such, is deemed to be the primary beneficiary or consolidator of the entity. The determination of the VIE’s primary beneficiary requires an evaluation of the contractual and implied rights and obligations associated with each party’s relationship with or involvement in the entity, an estimate of the entity’s expected losses and expected residual returns and the allocation of such estimates to each party involved in the entity.\n231\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n8. Investments (continued)\nConsolidated VIEs\nCreditors or beneficial interest holders of VIEs where the Company is the primary beneficiary have no recourse to the general credit of the Company, as the Company’s obligation to the VIEs is limited to the amount of its committed investment.\nThe following table presents the total assets and total liabilities relating to investment related VIEs for which the Company has concluded that it is the primary beneficiary and which are consolidated at:\n__________________\n(1)    Assets of the investment funds and renewable energy partnership primarily consisted of other invested assets.\n(2)    Assets of other investments primarily consisted of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 and other invested assets at December 31, 2019.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nThe carrying amount and maximum exposure to loss relating to VIEs in which the Company holds a significant variable interest but is not the primary beneficiary and which have not been consolidated were as follows at:\n__________________\n(1)\nThe maximum exposure to loss relating to fixed maturity securities AFS is equal to their carrying amounts or the carrying amounts of retained interests. The maximum exposure to loss relating to other limited partnership interests is equal to the carrying amounts plus any unfunded commitments. For certain of its investments in other invested assets, the Company’s return is in the form of income tax credits which are guaranteed by creditworthy third parties. For such investments, the maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amounts plus any unfunded commitments, reduced by income tax credits guaranteed by third parties of $\n3\nmillion and $\n6\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Such a maximum loss would be expected to occur only upon bankruptcy of the issuer or investee.\n(2)\nFor these variable interests, the Company’s involvement is limited to that of a passive investor in mortgage-backed or asset-backed securities issued by trusts that do not have substantial equity.\n232\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n8. Investments (continued)\nAs described in Note 21\n,\nthe Company makes commitments to fund partnership investments in the normal course of business. Excluding these commitments, the Company did not provide financial or other support to investees designated as VIEs for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nThe Company securitizes certain residential mortgage loans and acquires an interest in the related RMBS issued. While the Company has a variable interest in the issuer of the securities, it is not the primary beneficiary of the issuer of the securities since it does not have any rights to remove the servicer or veto rights over the servicer’s actions. The resulting gains (losses) from the securitizations are included within net investment gains (losses). The estimated fair value of the related RMBS acquired in connection with the securitizations is included in the carrying amount and maximum exposure to loss for Structured Products presented in the table above.\nThe carrying value and the estimated fair value of residential mortgage loans securitized were $\n308\nmillion and $\n313\nmillion, respectively, during 2020, and $\n443\nmillion and $\n467\nmillion, respectively, during 2019. Gains on securitizations of $\n5\nmillion and $\n24\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were included within net investment gains (losses). The estimated fair value of RMBS acquired in connection with the securitizations was $\n43\nmillion and $\n131\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSee\nNote 10 for information on how the estimated fair value of mortgage loans and RMBS is determined, the valuation approaches and key inputs, their placement in the fair value hierarchy, and for certain RMBS, quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs and the sensitivity of their estimated fair value to changes in those inputs.\nNet Investment Income\nThe components of net investment income were as follows:\n__________________\n(1)\nChanges in estimated fair value subsequent to purchase for investments still held as of the end of the respective periods and included in net investment income were principally from Unit-linked investments, and were $\n489\nmillion,\n$\n1.0\nbillion\nand ($\n771\n) million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNet investment income from equity method investments, comprised of real estate joint ventures, other limited partnership interests, tax credit and renewable energy partnerships and operating joint ventures, totaled $\n829\nmillion, $\n795\nmillion and $\n592\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n233\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n8.

Derivatives\nAccounting for Derivatives\nSee Note 1 for a description of the Company’s accounting policies for derivatives and Note 10 for information about the fair value hierarchy for derivatives.\nDerivative Strategies\nThe Company is exposed to various risks relating to its ongoing business operations, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and equity market. The Company uses a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives.\nDerivatives are financial instruments with values derived from interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and/or other financial indices. Derivatives may be exchange-traded or contracted in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) market. Certain of the Company’s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties (“OTC-cleared”), while others are bilateral contracts between two counterparties (“OTC-bilateral”). The types of derivatives the Company uses include swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. To a lesser extent, the Company uses credit default swaps and structured interest rate swaps to synthetically replicate investment risks and returns which are not readily available in the cash markets.\nInterest Rate Derivatives\nThe Company uses a variety of interest rate derivatives to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates, including interest rate swaps, interest rate total return swaps, caps, floors, swaptions, futures and forwards.\nInterest rate swaps are used by the Company primarily to reduce market risks from changes in interest rates and to alter interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities (duration mismatches). In an interest rate swap, the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts as calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount. The Company utilizes interest rate swaps in fair value, cash flow and nonqualifying hedging relationships.\nThe Company uses structured interest rate swaps to synthetically create investments that are either more expensive to acquire or otherwise unavailable in the cash markets. These transactions are a combination of a derivative and a cash instrument such as a U.S. government and agency, or other fixed maturity securities AFS. Structured interest rate swaps are included in interest rate swaps and are not designated as hedging instruments.\nInterest rate total return swaps are swaps whereby the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between the economic risk and reward of an asset or a market index and a benchmark interest rate, calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount. No cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract. Cash is paid and received over the life of the contract based on the terms of the swap. These transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by the counterparty at each due date. Interest rate total return swaps are used by the Company to reduce market risks from changes in interest rates and to alter interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities (duration mismatches). The Company utilizes interest rate total return swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n235\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n9. Derivatives (continued)\nThe Company purchases interest rate caps primarily to protect its floating rate liabilities against rises in interest rates above a specified level, and against interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities, and interest rate floors primarily to protect its minimum rate guarantee liabilities against declines in interest rates below a specified level. In certain instances, the Company locks in the economic impact of existing purchased caps and floors by entering into offsetting written caps and floors. The Company utilizes interest rate caps and floors in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\nIn exchange-traded interest rate (Treasury and swap) futures transactions, the Company agrees to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the value of which is determined by the different classes of interest rate securities, to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts and to pledge initial margin based on futures exchange requirements. The Company enters into exchange-traded futures with regulated futures commission merchants that are members of the exchange. Exchange-traded interest rate (Treasury and swap) futures are used primarily to hedge mismatches between the duration of assets in a portfolio and the duration of liabilities supported by those assets, to hedge against changes in value of securities the Company owns or anticipates acquiring, to hedge against changes in interest rates on anticipated liability issuances by replicating Treasury or swap curve performance, and to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products issued by the Company. The Company utilizes exchange-traded interest rate futures in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\nSwaptions are used by the Company to hedge interest rate risk associated with the Company’s long-term liabilities and invested assets. A swaption is an option to enter into a swap with a forward starting effective date. In certain instances, the Company locks in the economic impact of existing purchased swaptions by entering into offsetting written swaptions. The Company pays a premium for purchased swaptions and receives a premium for written swaptions. The Company utilizes swaptions in nonqualifying hedging relationships. Swaptions are included in interest rate options.\nThe Company enters into interest rate forwards to buy and sell securities. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at a specified future date. The Company utilizes interest rate forwards in cash flow and nonqualifying hedging relationships.\nA synthetic GIC is a contract that simulates the performance of a traditional GIC through the use of financial instruments. The contractholder owns the underlying assets, and the Company provides a guarantee (or “wrap”) on the participant funds for an annual risk charge. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss on synthetic GICs is the notional amount, in the event the values of all of the underlying assets were reduced to zero. The Company’s risk is substantially lower due to contractual provisions that limit the portfolio to high quality assets, which are pre-approved and monitored for compliance, as well as the collection of risk charges. In addition, the crediting rates reset periodically to amortize market value gains and losses over a period equal to the duration of the wrapped portfolio, subject to a 0% floor. While plan participants may transact at book value, contractholder withdrawals may only occur immediately at market value, or at book value paid over a period of time per contract provisions. Synthetic GICs are not designated as hedging instruments.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Derivatives\nThe Company uses foreign currency exchange rate derivatives, including foreign currency swaps, foreign currency forwards, currency options and exchange-traded currency futures, to reduce the risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associated with its assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The Company also uses foreign currency derivatives to hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of its net investments in foreign operations.\nIn a foreign currency swap transaction, the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between one currency and another at a fixed exchange rate, generally set at inception, calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount. The notional amount of each currency is exchanged at the inception and termination of the currency swap by each party. The Company utilizes foreign currency swaps in fair value, cash flow and nonqualifying hedging relationships.\nIn a foreign currency forward transaction, the Company agrees with another party to deliver a specified amount of an identified currency at a specified future date. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a contract is made at the specified future date. The Company utilizes foreign currency forwards in fair value, NIFO hedges and nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n236\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n9. Derivatives (continued)\nThe Company enters into currency options that give it the right, but not the obligation, to sell the foreign currency amount in exchange for a functional currency amount within a limited time at a contracted price. The contracts may also be net settled in cash, based on differentials in the foreign currency exchange rate and the strike price. The Company uses currency options to hedge against the foreign currency exposure inherent in certain of its variable annuity products. The Company also uses currency options as an economic hedge of foreign currency exposure related to the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company utilizes currency options in NIFO hedges and nonqualifying hedging relationships.\nTo a lesser extent, the Company uses exchange-traded currency futures to hedge currency mismatches between assets and liabilities, and to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products issued by the Company. The Company utilizes exchange-traded currency futures in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\nCredit Derivatives\nThe Company enters into purchased credit default swaps to hedge against credit-related changes in the value of its investments. In a credit default swap transaction, the Company agrees with another party to pay, at specified intervals, a premium to hedge credit risk. If a credit event occurs, as defined by the contract, the contract may be cash settled or it may be settled gross by the delivery of par quantities of the referenced investment equal to the specified swap notional amount in exchange for the payment of cash amounts by the counterparty equal to the par value of the investment surrendered. Credit events vary by type of issuer but typically include bankruptcy, failure to pay debt obligations and involuntary restructuring for corporate obligors, as well as repudiation, moratorium or governmental intervention for sovereign obligors. In each case, payout on a credit default swap is triggered only after the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (“ISDA”) deems that a credit event has occurred. The Company utilizes credit default swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\nThe Company enters into written credit default swaps to synthetically create credit investments that are either more expensive to acquire or otherwise unavailable in the cash markets. These transactions are a combination of a derivative and one or more cash instruments, such as U.S. government and agency, or other fixed maturity securities AFS. These credit default swaps are not designated as hedging instruments.\nThe Company enters into forwards to lock in the price to be paid for forward purchases of certain securities. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for the contract is made at a specified future date. When the primary purpose of entering into these transactions is to hedge against the risk of changes in purchase price due to changes in credit spreads, the Company designates these transactions as credit forwards. The Company utilizes credit forwards in cash flow hedging relationships.\nEquity Derivatives\nThe Company uses a variety of equity derivatives to reduce its exposure to equity market risk, including equity index options, equity variance swaps, exchange-traded equity futures and equity total return swaps.\nEquity index options are used by the Company primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products issued by the Company. To hedge against adverse changes in equity indices, the Company enters into contracts to sell the underlying equity index within a limited time at a contracted price. The contracts will be net settled in cash based on differentials in the indices at the time of exercise and the strike price. Certain of these contracts may also contain settlement provisions linked to interest rates. In certain instances, the Company may enter into a combination of transactions to hedge adverse changes in equity indices within a pre-determined range through the purchase and sale of options. The Company utilizes equity index options in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\nEquity variance swaps are used by the Company primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products issued by the Company. In an equity variance swap, the Company agrees with another party to exchange amounts in the future, based on changes in equity volatility over a defined period. The Company utilizes equity variance swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n237\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n9. Derivatives (continued)\nIn exchange-traded equity futures transactions, the Company agrees to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the value of which is determined by the different classes of equity securities, to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts and to pledge initial margin based on futures exchange requirements. The Company enters into exchange-traded futures with regulated futures commission merchants that are members of the exchange. Exchange-traded equity futures are used primarily to hedge minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products issued by the Company. The Company utilizes exchange-traded equity futures in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\nIn an equity total return swap, the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between the economic risk and reward of an asset or a market index and a benchmark interest rate, calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount. No cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract. Cash is paid and received over the life of the contract based on the terms of the swap. The Company uses equity total return swaps to hedge its equity market guarantees in certain of its insurance products. Equity total return swaps can be used as hedges or to synthetically create investments. The Company utilizes equity total return swaps in nonqualifying hedging relationships.\n238\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n9. Derivatives (continued)\nPrimary Risks Managed by Derivatives\nThe following table presents the primary underlying risk exposure, gross notional amount, and estimated fair value of the Company’s derivatives, excluding embedded derivatives, held at:\n239\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n9. Derivatives (continued)\nBased on gross notional amounts, a substantial portion of the Company’s derivatives was not designated or did not qualify as part of a hedging relationship at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company’s use of derivatives includes (i) derivatives that serve as macro hedges of the Company’s exposure to various risks and that generally do not qualify for hedge accounting due to the criteria required under the portfolio hedging rules; (ii) derivatives that economically hedge insurance liabilities that contain mortality or morbidity risk and that generally do not qualify for hedge accounting because the lack of these risks in the derivatives cannot support an expectation of a highly effective hedging relationship; (iii) derivatives that economically hedge embedded derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting because the changes in estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives are already recorded in net income; and (iv) written credit default swaps and interest rate swaps that are used to synthetically create investments and that do not qualify for hedge accounting because they do not involve a hedging relationship. For these nonqualified derivatives, changes in market factors can lead to the recognition of fair value changes on the statement of operations without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged.\n240\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n9.

Derivatives (continued)\nFair Value Hedges\nThe Company designates and accounts for the following as fair value hedges when they have met the requirements of fair value hedging: (i) interest rate swaps to convert fixed rate assets and liabilities to floating rate assets and liabilities; (ii) foreign currency swaps to hedge the foreign currency fair value exposure of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities; and (iii) foreign currency forwards to hedge the foreign currency fair value exposure of foreign currency denominated investments.\nThe following table presents the balance sheet classification, carrying amount and cumulative fair value hedging adjustments for items designated and qualifying as hedged items in fair value hedges:\n__________________\n(1)\nIncludes ($\n1\n) million of hedging adjustments on discontinued hedging relationships at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nFor the Company’s foreign currency forwards, the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative related to the changes in the difference between the spot price and the forward price is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The Company has elected to record changes in estimated fair value of excluded components in earnings. For all other derivatives, all components of each derivative’s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company designates and accounts for the following as cash flow hedges when they have met the requirements of cash flow hedging: (i) interest rate swaps to convert floating rate assets and liabilities to fixed rate assets and liabilities; (ii) foreign currency swaps to hedge the foreign currency cash flow exposure of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities; (iii) interest rate forwards and credit forwards to lock in the price to be paid for forward purchases of investments; (iv) interest rate swaps and interest rate forwards to hedge the forecasted purchases of fixed rate investments; and (v) interest rate swaps and interest rate forwards to hedge forecasted fixed rate borrowings.\nIn certain instances, the Company discontinued cash flow hedge accounting because the forecasted transactions were no longer probable of occurring. Because certain of the forecasted transactions also were not probable of occurring within two months of the anticipated date, the Company reclassified amounts from AOCI into income. These amounts were $\n21\nmillion, $\n58\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAt both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the maximum length of time over which the Company was hedging its exposure to variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions did not exceed\neight years\n.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the balance in AOCI associated with cash flow hedges was $\n1.9\nbillion and $\n2.2\nbillion, respectively.\nAll components of each derivative’s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company expected to reclassify $\n55\nmillion of deferred net gains (losses) on derivatives in AOCI to earnings within the next 12 months.\n244\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n9. Derivatives (continued)\nNIFO Hedges\nThe Company uses foreign currency exchange rate derivatives, which may include foreign currency forwards and currency options, to hedge portions of its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The Company also designates a portion of its foreign-denominated debt as a non-derivative hedging instrument of its net investments in foreign operations. The Company assesses hedge effectiveness of its derivatives based upon the change in forward rates and assesses its non-derivative hedging instruments based upon the change in spot rates. All components of each derivative’s gain or loss were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.\nWhen net investments in foreign operations are sold or substantially liquidated, the amounts in AOCI are reclassified to the statement of operations.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the cumulative foreign currency translation gain (loss) recorded in AOCI related to NIFO hedges was $\n164\nmillion and $\n148\nmillion, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying amount of debt designated as a non-derivative hedging instrument was $\n407\nmillion and $\n387\nmillion, respectively.\nSee Note 13 for additional information on foreign-denominated debt.\nCredit Derivatives\nIn connection with synthetically created credit investment transactions, the Company writes credit default swaps for which it receives a premium to insure credit risk. Such credit derivatives are included within the effects of derivatives on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) table. If a credit event occurs, as defined by the contract, the contract may be cash settled or it may be settled gross by the Company paying the counterparty the specified swap notional amount in exchange for the delivery of par quantities of the referenced credit obligation. The Company’s maximum amount at risk, assuming the value of all referenced credit obligations is zero, was $\n9.6\nbillion and $\n11.5\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company can terminate these contracts at any time through cash settlement with the counterparty at an amount equal to the then current estimated fair value of the credit default swaps. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company would have received $\n196\nmillion and $\n271\nmillion, respectively, to terminate all of these contracts.\n245\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n9. Derivatives (continued)\nThe following table presents the estimated fair value, maximum amount of future payments and weighted average years to maturity of written credit default swaps at:\n__________________\n(1)\nThe rating agency designations are based on availability and the midpoint of the applicable ratings among Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), S&P and Fitch Ratings. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is used.\n(2)\nThe weighted average years to maturity of the credit default swaps is calculated based on weighted average gross notional amounts.\n(3)\nSingle name credit default swaps may be referenced to the credit of corporations, foreign governments, or municipals.\nCredit Risk on Freestanding Derivatives\nThe Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties to derivatives. Generally, the current credit exposure of the Company’s derivatives is limited to the net positive estimated fair value of derivatives at the reporting date after taking into consideration the existence of master netting or similar agreements and any collateral received pursuant to such agreements.\nThe Company manages its credit risk related to derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy counterparties and establishing and monitoring exposure limits. The Company’s OTC-bilateral derivative transactions are governed by ISDA Master Agreements which provide for legally enforceable set-off and close-out netting of exposures to specific counterparties in the event of early termination of a transaction, which includes, but is not limited to, events of default and bankruptcy. In the event of an early termination, the Company is permitted to set off receivables from the counterparty against payables to the same counterparty arising out of all included transactions. All of the Company’s ISDA Master Agreements also include Credit Support Annex provisions which require both the pledging and accepting of collateral in connection with its OTC-bilateral derivatives.\n246\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n9. Derivatives (continued)\nThe Company’s OTC-cleared derivatives are effected through central clearing counterparties and its exchange-traded derivatives are effected through regulated exchanges. Such positions are marked to market and margined on a daily basis (both initial margin and variation margin), and the Company has minimal exposure to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such derivatives.\nSee Note 10 for a description of the impact of credit risk on the valuation of derivatives.\nThe estimated fair values of the Company’s net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities after the application of master netting agreements and collateral were as follows at:\n__________________\n(1)\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, derivative assets included income (expense) accruals reported in accrued investment income or in other liabilities of $\n92\nmillion and $\n111\nmillion, respectively, and derivative liabilities included (income) expense accruals reported in accrued investment income or in other liabilities of ($\n58\n) million and ($\n21\n) million, respectively.\n(2)\nEstimated fair value of derivatives is limited to the amount that is subject to set-off and includes income or expense accruals.\n(3)\nCash collateral received by the Company for OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives, where the centralized clearinghouse treats variation margin as collateral, is included in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments or in fixed maturity securities AFS, and the obligation to return it is included in payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions on the balance sheet.\n247\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n9. Derivatives (continued)\n(4)\nThe receivable for the return of cash collateral provided by the Company is inclusive of initial margin on exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives and is included in premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the balance sheet. The amount of cash collateral offset in the table above is limited to the net estimated fair value of derivatives after application of netting agreements. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company received excess cash collateral of $\n265\nmillion and $\n389\nmillion, respectively, and provided excess cash collateral of $\n238\nmillion and $\n266\nmillion, respectively, which is not included in the table above due to the foregoing limitation.\n(5)\nSecurities collateral received by the Company is held in separate custodial accounts and is not recorded on the balance sheet. Subject to certain constraints, the Company is permitted by contract to sell or re-pledge this collateral, but at December 31, 2020,\nnone\nof the collateral had been sold or re-pledged. Securities collateral pledged by the Company is reported in fixed maturity securities AFS on the balance sheet. Subject to certain constraints, the counterparties are permitted by contract to sell or re-pledge this collateral. The amount of securities collateral offset in the table above is limited to the net estimated fair value of derivatives after application of netting agreements and cash collateral. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company received excess securities collateral with an estimated fair value of $\n231\nmillion and $\n156\nmillion, respectively, for its OTC-bilateral derivatives, which are not included in the table above due to the foregoing limitation. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company provided excess securities collateral with an estimated fair value of $\n269\nmillion and $\n189\nmillion, respectively, for its OTC-bilateral derivatives, $\n2.1\nbillion and $\n1.0\nbillion, respectively, for its OTC-cleared derivatives, and $\n318\nmillion and $\n143\nmillion, respectively, for its exchange-traded derivatives, which are not included in the table above due to the foregoing limitation.\nThe Company’s collateral arrangements for its OTC-bilateral derivatives generally require the counterparty in a net liability position, after considering the effect of netting agreements, to pledge collateral when the collateral amount owed by that counterparty reaches a minimum transfer amount. All of the Company’s netting agreements for derivatives contain provisions that require both the Company and the counterparty to maintain a specific investment grade credit rating from each of Moody’s and S&P. If a party’s credit or financial strength rating, as applicable, were to fall below that specific investment grade credit rating, that party would be in violation of these provisions, and the other party to the derivatives could terminate the transactions and demand immediate settlement and payment based on such party’s reasonable valuation of the derivatives. A small number of these arrangements also include credit-contingent provisions that include a threshold above which collateral must be posted. Such agreements provide for a reduction of these thresholds (on a sliding scale that converges toward zero) in the event of downgrades in the credit ratings of MetLife, Inc. and/or the counterparty. At December 31, 2020, the amount of collateral not provided by the Company due to the existence of these thresholds was $\n15\nmillion.\nThe following table presents the estimated fair value of the Company’s OTC-bilateral derivatives that were in a net liability position after considering the effect of netting agreements, together with the estimated fair value and balance sheet location of the collateral pledged.\n__________________\n(1)\nAfter taking into consideration the existence of netting agreements.\n248\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n9. Derivatives (continued)\nEmbedded Derivatives\nThe Company issues certain products or purchases certain investments that contain embedded derivatives that are required to be separated from their host contracts and accounted for as freestanding derivatives.\nThe following table presents the estimated fair value and balance sheet location of the Company’s embedded derivatives that have been separated from their host contracts at:\n249\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n10. Fair Value\nWhen developing estimated fair values, the Company considers three broad valuation approaches: (i) the market approach, (ii) the income approach, and (iii) the cost approach. The Company determines the most appropriate valuation approach to use, given what is being measured and the availability of sufficient inputs, giving priority to observable inputs. The Company categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value into a three-level hierarchy, based on the significant input with the lowest level in its valuation. The input levels are as follows:\nFinancial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. The Company’s ability to sell securities, as well as the price ultimately realized for these securities, depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain securities.\nConsiderable judgment is often required in interpreting the market data used to develop estimates of fair value, and the use of different assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.\n250\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n10. Fair Value (continued)\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding placement in the fair value hierarchy, including those items for which the Company has elected the FVO, are presented below at:\n251\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n10. Fair Value (continued)\n__________________\n(1)\nExcludes amounts for financial instruments reclassified to assets held-for-sale or liabilities held-for-sale. Assets held-for-sale and liabilities held-for-sale are valued on a basis consistent with similar instruments described herein. See Note 3 for information on the pending disposition of MetLife P&C.\n(2)\nUnit-linked and FVO Securities were primarily comprised of Unit-linked investments at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(3)\nShort-term investments as presented in the tables above differ from the amounts presented on the consolidated balance sheets because certain short-term investments are not measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis.\n252\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n10. Fair Value (continued)\n(4)\nDerivative assets are presented within other invested assets on the consolidated balance sheets and derivative liabilities are presented within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The amounts are presented gross in the tables above to reflect the presentation on the consolidated balance sheets, but are presented net for purposes of the rollforward in the Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) tables.\n(5)\nEmbedded derivatives within asset host contracts are presented within premiums, reinsurance and other receivables and other invested assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Embedded derivatives within liability host contracts are presented within policyholder account balances and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(6)\nInvestment performance related to separate account assets is fully offset by corresponding amounts credited to contractholders whose liability is reflected within separate account liabilities. Separate account liabilities are set equal to the estimated fair value of separate account assets. Separate account liabilities presented in the tables above represent derivative liabilities.\n(7)\nTotal assets included in the fair value hierarchy exclude other limited partnership interests that are measured at estimated fair value using the net asset value (“NAV”) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the estimated fair value of such investments was $\n75\nmillion and $\n95\nmillion, respectively.\nThe following describes the valuation methodologies used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.\nInvestments\nSecurities, Short-term Investments and Other Investments\nWhen available, the estimated fair value of these financial instruments is based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable. Generally, these are the most liquid of the Company’s securities holdings and valuation of these securities does not involve management’s judgment.\nWhen quoted prices in active markets are not available, the determination of estimated fair value is based on market standard valuation methodologies, giving priority to observable inputs. The significant inputs to the market standard valuation methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. When observable inputs are not available, the market standard valuation methodologies rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. These unobservable inputs can be based in large part on management’s judgment or estimation and cannot be supported by reference to market activity. Even though these inputs are unobservable, management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such securities and are considered appropriate given the circumstances.\nThe estimated fair value of short-term investments and other investments is determined on a basis consistent with the methodologies described herein for securities.\nThe valuation approaches and key inputs for each category of assets or liabilities that are classified within Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are presented below. The primary valuation approaches are the market approach, which considers recent prices from market transactions involving identical or similar assets or liabilities, and the income approach, which converts expected future amounts (e.g. cash flows) to a single current, discounted amount. The valuation of most instruments listed below is determined using independent pricing sources, matrix pricing, discounted cash flow methodologies or other similar techniques that use either observable market inputs or unobservable inputs.\n253\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n10. Fair Value (continued)\n254\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n10. Fair Value (continued)\n__________________\n(1)\nEstimated fair value equals carrying value, based on the value of the underlying assets, including: mutual fund interests, fixed maturity securities, equity securities, derivatives, hedge funds, other limited partnership interests, short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents. Fixed maturity securities, equity securities, derivatives, short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents are similar in nature to the instruments described under “— Securities, Short-term Investments and Other Investments” and “— Derivatives — Freestanding Derivatives.”\n255\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n10. Fair Value (continued)\nDerivatives\nThe estimated fair value of derivatives is determined through the use of quoted market prices for exchange-traded derivatives, or through the use of pricing models for OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives. The determination of estimated fair value, when quoted market values are not available, is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads, default risk, nonperformance risk, volatility, liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models.\nThe significant inputs to the pricing models for most OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives are inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Certain OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives may rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. These unobservable inputs may involve significant management judgment or estimation. Even though unobservable, these inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments.\nMost inputs for OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives are mid-market inputs but, in certain cases, liquidity adjustments are made when they are deemed more representative of exit value. Market liquidity, as well as the use of different methodologies, assumptions and inputs, may have a material effect on the estimated fair values of the Company’s derivatives and could materially affect net income.\nThe credit risk of both the counterparty and the Company are considered in determining the estimated fair value for all OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives, and any potential credit adjustment is based on the net exposure by counterparty after taking into account the effects of netting agreements and collateral arrangements. The Company values its OTC-bilateral and OTC-cleared derivatives using standard swap curves which may include a spread to the risk-free rate, depending upon specific collateral arrangements. This credit spread is appropriate for those parties that execute trades at pricing levels consistent with similar collateral arrangements. As the Company and its significant derivative counterparties generally execute trades at such pricing levels and hold sufficient collateral, additional credit risk adjustments are not currently required in the valuation process. The Company’s ability to consistently execute at such pricing levels is, in part, due to the netting agreements and collateral arrangements that are in place with all of its significant derivative counterparties. An evaluation of the requirement to make additional credit risk adjustments is performed by the Company each reporting period.\nFreestanding Derivatives\nLevel 2 Valuation Approaches and Key Inputs:\nThis level includes all types of derivatives utilized by the Company with the exception of exchange-traded derivatives included within Level 1 and those derivatives with unobservable inputs as described in Level 3.\nLevel 3 Valuation Approaches and Key Inputs:\nThese valuation methodologies generally use the same inputs as described in the corresponding sections for Level 2 measurements of derivatives. However, these derivatives result in Level 3 classification because one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.\n256\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n10. Fair Value (continued)\nFreestanding derivatives are principally valued using the income approach. Valuations of non-option-based derivatives utilize present value techniques, whereas valuations of option-based derivatives utilize option pricing models. Key inputs are as follows:\n__________________\n(1)\nOption-based only.\n(2)\nExtrapolation beyond the observable limits of the curve(s).\nEmbedded Derivatives\nEmbedded derivatives principally include certain direct, assumed and ceded variable annuity guarantees, annuity contracts, and investment risk within funds withheld related to certain reinsurance agreements. Embedded derivatives are recorded at estimated fair value with changes in estimated fair value reported in net income.\nThe Company issues certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits. GMWBs, GMABs and certain GMIBs contain embedded derivatives, which are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). These embedded derivatives are classified within policyholder account balances on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company calculates the fair value of these embedded derivatives, which is estimated as the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees using actuarial and capital market assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. The calculation is based on in-force business, projecting future cash flows from the embedded derivative over multiple risk neutral stochastic scenarios using observable risk-free rates.\nCapital market assumptions, such as risk-free rates and implied volatilities, are based on market prices for publicly traded instruments to the extent that prices for such instruments are observable. Implied volatilities beyond the observable period are extrapolated based on observable implied volatilities and historical volatilities. Actuarial assumptions, including mortality, lapse, withdrawal and utilization, are unobservable and are reviewed at least annually based on actuarial studies of historical experience.\nThe valuation of these guarantee liabilities includes nonperformance risk adjustments and adjustments for a risk margin related to non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance adjustment is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for MetLife, Inc.’s debt, including related credit default swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries as compared to MetLife, Inc.\n257\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n10. Fair Value (continued)\nRisk margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such actuarial assumptions as annuitization, premium persistency, partial withdrawal and surrenders. The establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees. These guarantees may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates; changes in nonperformance risk; and variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs, may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income.\nThe Company ceded the risk associated with certain of the GMIBs previously described. These reinsurance agreements contain embedded derivatives which are included within premiums, reinsurance and other receivables on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses) or policyholder benefits and claims depending on the statement of operations classification of the direct risk. The value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by the Company with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer.\nThe estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives within funds withheld related to certain ceded reinsurance is determined based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying assets held by the Company in a reference portfolio backing the funds withheld liability. The estimated fair value of the underlying assets is determined as described in “— Investments — Securities, Short-term Investments and Other Investments.” The estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives is included, along with their funds withheld hosts, in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). Changes in the credit spreads on the underlying assets, interest rates and market volatility may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives that could materially affect net income.\nThe Company issues certain annuity contracts which allow the policyholder to participate in returns from equity indices. These equity indexed features are embedded derivatives which are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host fixed annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains (losses). These embedded derivatives are classified within policyholder account balances on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe estimated fair value of the embedded equity indexed derivatives, based on the present value of future equity returns to the policyholder using actuarial and present value assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior, is calculated by the Company’s actuarial department. The calculation is based on in-force business and uses standard capital market techniques, such as Black-Scholes, to calculate the value of the portion of the embedded derivative for which the terms are set. The portion of the embedded derivative covering the period beyond where terms are set is calculated as the present value of amounts expected to be spent to provide equity indexed returns in those periods. The valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes the establishment of a risk margin, as well as changes in nonperformance risk.\nEmbedded Derivatives Within Asset and Liability Host Contracts\nLevel 3 Valuation Approaches and Key Inputs:\nDirect and assumed guaranteed minimum benefits\nThese embedded derivatives are principally valued using the income approach. Valuations are based on option pricing techniques, which utilize significant inputs that may include swap yield curves, currency exchange rates and implied volatilities. These embedded derivatives result in Level 3 classification because one or more of the significant inputs are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Significant unobservable inputs generally include: the extrapolation beyond observable limits of the swap yield curves and implied volatilities, actuarial assumptions for policyholder behavior and mortality and the potential variability in policyholder behavior and mortality, nonperformance risk and cost of capital for purposes of calculating the risk margin.\n258\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n10. Fair Value (continued)\nReinsurance ceded on certain guaranteed minimum benefits\nThese embedded derivatives are principally valued using the income approach. The valuation techniques and significant market standard unobservable inputs used in their valuation are similar to those described above in “— Direct and assumed guaranteed minimum benefits” and also include counterparty credit spreads.\nTransfers between Levels\nOverall, transfers between levels occur when there are changes in the observability of inputs and market activity.\nTransfers into or out of Level 3:\nAssets and liabilities are transferred into Level 3 when a significant input cannot be corroborated with market observable data. This occurs when market activity decreases significantly and underlying inputs cannot be observed, current prices are not available, and/or when there are significant variances in quoted prices, thereby affecting transparency. Assets and liabilities are transferred out of Level 3 when circumstances change such that a significant input can be corroborated with market observable data. This may be due to a significant increase in market activity, a specific event, or one or more significant input(s) becoming observable.\n259\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n10. Fair Value (continued)\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)\nThe following table presents certain quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement, and the sensitivity of the estimated fair value to changes in those inputs, for the more significant asset and liability classes measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) at:\n__________________\n(1)\nThe weighted average for fixed maturity securities AFS and derivatives is determined based on the estimated fair value of the securities and derivatives. The weighted average for embedded derivatives is determined based on a combination of account values and experience data.\n(2)\nThe impact of a decrease in input would have resulted in the opposite impact on estimated fair value. For embedded derivatives, changes to direct and assumed guaranteed minimum benefits are based on liability positions; changes to ceded guaranteed minimum benefits are based on asset positions.\n(3)\nSignificant increases (decreases) in expected default rates in isolation would have resulted in substantially lower (higher) valuations.\n(4)\nRange and weighted average are presented in accordance with the market convention for fixed maturity securities AFS of dollars per hundred dollars of par.\n260\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n10. Fair Value (continued)\n(5)\nChanges in the assumptions used for the probability of default would have been accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumption used for the loss severity and a directionally opposite change in the assumptions used for prepayment rates.\n(6)\nRanges represent the rates across different yield curves and are presented in basis points. The swap yield curves are utilized among different types of derivatives to project cash flows, as well as to discount future cash flows to present value. Since this valuation methodology uses a range of inputs across a yield curve to value the derivative, presenting a range is more representative of the unobservable input used in the valuation.\n(7)\nChanges in estimated fair value are based on long U.S. dollar net asset positions and will be inversely impacted for short U.S. dollar net asset positions.\n(8)\nRanges represent different repurchase rates utilized as components within the valuation methodology and are presented in basis points.\n(9)\nRepresents the risk quoted in basis points of a credit default event on the underlying instrument. Credit derivatives with significant unobservable inputs are primarily comprised of written credit default swaps.\n(10)\nAt\nboth\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, independent non-binding broker quotations were used in the determination of\nless than 1%\nof the total net derivative estimated fair value.\n(11)\nRanges represent the underlying equity volatility quoted in percentage points. Since this valuation methodology uses a range of inputs across multiple volatility surfaces to value the derivative, presenting a range is more representative of the unobservable input used in the valuation.\n(12)\nRanges represent the different correlation factors utilized as components within the valuation methodology. Presenting a range of correlation factors is more representative of the unobservable input used in the valuation. Increases (decreases) in correlation in isolation will increase (decrease) the significance of the change in valuations.\n(13)\nMortality rates vary by age and by demographic characteristics such as gender. Mortality rate assumptions are based on company experience. A mortality improvement assumption is also applied. For any given contract, mortality rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative.\n(14)\nBase lapse rates are adjusted at the contract level based on a comparison of the actuarially calculated guaranteed values and the current policyholder account value, as well as other factors, such as the applicability of any surrender charges. A dynamic lapse function reduces the base lapse rate when the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value as in the money contracts are less likely to lapse. Lapse rates are also generally assumed to be lower in periods when a surrender charge applies. For any given contract, lapse rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative.\n(15)\nThe utilization rate assumption estimates the percentage of contractholders with a GMIB or lifetime withdrawal benefit who will elect to utilize the benefit upon becoming eligible. The rates may vary by the type of guarantee, the amount by which the guaranteed amount is greater than the account value, the contract’s withdrawal history and by the age of the policyholder. For any given contract, utilization rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative.\n(16)\nThe withdrawal rate represents the percentage of account balance that any given policyholder will elect to withdraw from the contract each year. The withdrawal rate assumption varies by age and duration of the contract, and also by other factors such as benefit type. For any given contract, withdrawal rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative. For GMWBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of the guarantees. For GMABs and GMIBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value.\n(17)\nLong-term equity volatilities represent equity volatility beyond the period for which observable equity volatilities are available. For any given contract, long-term equity volatility rates vary throughout the period over which cash flows are projected for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative.\n(18)\nNonperformance risk spread varies by duration and by currency. For any given contract, multiple nonperformance risk spreads will apply, depending on the duration of the cash flow being discounted for purposes of valuing the embedded derivative.\n261\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n10. Fair Value (continued)\nGenerally, all other classes of assets and liabilities classified within Level 3 that are not included in the preceding table use the same valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs as previously described for Level 3. The sensitivity of the estimated fair value to changes in the significant unobservable inputs for these other assets and liabilities is similar in nature to that described in the preceding table. The valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement for the more significant assets measured at estimated fair value on a nonrecurring basis and determined using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) are summarized in “— Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.”\n262\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n10.

Fair Value (continued)\nFair Value of Financial Instruments Carried at Other Than Fair Value\nThe following tables provide fair value information for financial instruments that are carried on the balance sheet at amounts other than fair value. These tables exclude the following financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accrued investment income, payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions, short-term debt and those short-term investments that are not securities, such as time deposits, and therefore are not included in the three-level hierarchy table disclosed in the “— Recurring Fair Value Measurements” section. The Company believes that due to the short-term nature of these excluded assets, which are primarily classified in Level 2, the estimated fair value approximates carrying value. All remaining balance sheet amounts excluded from the tables below are not considered financial instruments subject to this disclosure.\nThe carrying values and estimated fair values for such financial instruments, and their corresponding placement in the fair value hierarchy, are summarized as follows at:\n_________________\n(1)\nExcludes amounts for financial instruments reclassified to assets held-for-sale or liabilities held-for-sale.

Goodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test. The goodwill impairment process requires a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative assessment or a quantitative test. The qualitative impairment assessment is an assessment of historical information and relevant events and circumstances to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company may elect not to perform the qualitative impairment assessment for some or all of its reporting units and perform a quantitative impairment test. In performing the quantitative impairment test, the Company may determine the fair values of its reporting units by applying a market multiple, discounted cash flow, and/or an actuarial-based valuation approach.\nThe valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectation regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. Declines in the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect the Company’s results of operations or financial position.\n268\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n12.

Payments of interest and principal on the Company’s surplus notes, which are subordinate to all other obligations of the operating company issuing the notes and are senior to obligations of MetLife, Inc., may be made only with the prior approval of the insurance department of the state of domicile of the notes issuer. The Company’s collateral financing arrangement (see Note 14) is supported by surplus notes of a subsidiary and, accordingly, has priority consistent with surplus notes.\nCertain of the Company’s debt instruments and committed facilities, as well as its unsecured revolving credit facility, contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants.

When drawn upon, these facilities bear interest at varying rates in accordance with the respective agreements.\nCredit Facility\nThe Company’s Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes, to support the borrowers’ commercial paper programs and for the issuance of letters of credit. Total fees associated with the Credit Facility were $\n14\nmillion, $\n12\nmillion and $\n10\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and were included in other expenses.\nInformation on the Credit Facility at December 31, 2020 was as follows:\n__________________\n(1)\nAll borrowings under the Credit Facility must be repaid by December 20, 2021, except that letters of credit outstanding upon termination may remain outstanding until December 20, 2022.\nCommitted Facilities\nLetters of credit issued under the Committed Facilities are used for collateral for certain of the Company’s affiliated reinsurance liabilities.

Collateral Financing Arrangement\nInformation related to the collateral financing arrangement associated with the closed block (see Note 7) was as follows at:\n__________________\n(1)\nCarrying value.\n(2)\nEstimated fair value.\nInterest expense on the collateral financing arrangement was $\n20\nmillion, $\n38\nmillion and $\n37\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which is included in other expenses.\nIn December 2007, MLIC reinsured a portion of its closed block liabilities to MetLife Reinsurance Company of Charleston (“MRC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. In connection with this transaction, MRC issued, to investors placed by an unaffiliated financial institution, $\n2.5\nbillion in aggregate principal amount of\n35\n-year surplus notes to provide statutory reserve support for the assumed closed block liabilities. Interest on the surplus notes accrues at an annual rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.55%, payable quarterly. The ability of MRC to make interest and principal payments on the surplus notes is contingent upon South Carolina regulatory approval.\nSimultaneously with the issuance of the surplus notes, MetLife, Inc. entered into an agreement with the unaffiliated financial institution, under which MetLife, Inc. is entitled to the interest paid by MRC on the surplus notes of\nthree-month LIBOR plus 0.55%\nin exchange for the payment of\nthree-month LIBOR plus 1.12%\n, payable quarterly on such amount as adjusted, as described below. MetLife, Inc. may also be required to pledge collateral or make payments to the unaffiliated financial institution related to any decline in the estimated fair value of the surplus notes. Any such payments are accounted for as a receivable and included in other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and do not reduce the principal amount outstanding of the surplus notes. Such payments, however, reduce the amount of interest payments due from MetLife, Inc. under the agreement. Any payment received from the unaffiliated financial institution reduces the receivable by an amount equal to such payment and also increases the amount of interest payments due from MetLife, Inc. under the agreement. In addition, the unaffiliated financial institution may be required to pledge collateral to MetLife, Inc. related to any increase in the estimated fair value of the surplus notes.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, following regulatory approval, MRC repurchased $\n148\nmillion, $\n67\nmillion and $\n61\nmillion, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of the surplus notes. Cumulatively, since December 2007, MRC repurchased $\n1.7\nbillion in aggregate principal amount of the surplus notes as of December 31, 2020. Payments made by the Company in 2020, 2019 and 2018 associated with the repurchases were exclusive of accrued interest on the surplus notes. In connection with the repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company received payments in the aggregate amount of $\n20\nmillion, $\n9\nmillion and $\n7\nmillion, respectively, from the unaffiliated financial institution, which reduced the amount receivable from the unaffiliated financial institution by the same amounts. No other payments related to an increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the surplus notes were made by MetLife, Inc. or received from the unaffiliated financial institution for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nA majority of the proceeds from the offering of the surplus notes was placed in a trust, which is consolidated by the Company, to support MRC’s statutory obligations associated with the assumed closed block liabilities. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, MRC transferred $\n2\nmillion and $\n97\nmillion, respectively, to the trust out of its general account. For the year ended December 31, 2020, MRC transferred $\n78\nmillion out of the trust to its general account. The assets are principally invested in fixed maturity securities AFS and are presented as such within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, with the related income included within net investment income on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.\n273\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n15. Junior Subordinated Debt Securities\nOutstanding Junior Subordinated Debt Securities\nOutstanding junior subordinated debt securities and exchangeable surplus trust securities which are exchangeable for junior subordinated debt securities prior to redemption or repayment, were as follows:\n_________________\n(1)\nPrior to the scheduled redemption date, interest is payable semiannually in arrears.\n(2)\nIn the event the securities are not redeemed on or before the scheduled redemption date, interest will accrue after such date at an annual rate of\nthree-month LIBOR\nplus the indicated margin, payable quarterly in arrears.\n(3)\nMetLife Capital Trust IV is a VIE which is consolidated on the financial statements of the Company. The securities issued by this entity are exchangeable surplus trust securities, which are exchangeable for a like amount of MetLife, Inc.’s junior subordinated debt securities on the scheduled redemption date, mandatorily under certain circumstances, and at any time upon MetLife, Inc. exercising its option to redeem the securities.\n274\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n15. Junior Subordinated Debt Securities (continued)\nIn connection with each of the securities described above, MetLife, Inc. may redeem or may cause the redemption of the securities (i) in whole or in part, at any time on or after the date five years prior to the scheduled redemption date at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption, or (ii) in certain circumstances, in whole or in part, prior to the date five years prior to the scheduled redemption date at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption or, if greater, a make-whole price. MetLife, Inc. also has the right to, and in certain circumstances the requirement to, defer interest payments on the securities for a period up to 10 years. Interest compounds during such periods of deferral. If interest is deferred for more than five consecutive years, MetLife, Inc. is required to use proceeds from the sale of its common stock or warrants on common stock to satisfy this interest payment obligation. In connection with each of the securities described above, MetLife, Inc. entered into a separate replacement capital covenant (“RCC”). As part of each RCC, MetLife, Inc. agreed that it will not repay, redeem, or purchase the securities on or before a date 10 years prior to the final maturity date of each issuance, unless, subject to certain limitations, it has received cash proceeds during a specified period from the sale of specified replacement securities. Each RCC will terminate upon the occurrence of certain events, including an acceleration of the applicable securities due to the occurrence of an event of default. The RCCs are not intended for the benefit of holders of the securities and may not be enforced by them. Rather, each RCC is for the benefit of the holders of a designated series of MetLife, Inc.’s other indebtedness (the “Covered Debt”). Initially, the Covered Debt for each of the securities described above was MetLife, Inc.’s\n5.700\n% senior notes due 2035 (the “\n5.700\n% Senior Notes”). As a result of the issuance of MetLife, Inc.’s\n10.750\n% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2069 (the “\n10.750\n% JSDs”), the\n10.750\n% JSDs became the Covered Debt with respect to, and in accordance with, the terms of the RCC relating to MetLife, Inc.’s\n6.40\n% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2066. The\n5.700\n% Senior Notes continue to be the Covered Debt with respect to, and in accordance with, the terms of the RCCs relating to each of MetLife Capital Trust IV’s\n7.875\n% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Exchangeable Surplus Trust Securities, MetLife, Inc.’s\n9.250\n% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures and the\n10.750\n% JSDs. MetLife, Inc. also entered into a replacement capital obligation which will commence during the six-month period prior to the scheduled redemption date of each of the securities described above and under which MetLife, Inc. must use reasonable commercial efforts to raise replacement capital to permit repayment of the securities through the issuance of certain qualifying capital securities.\nInterest expense on outstanding junior subordinated debt securities was $\n261\nmillion, $\n261\nmillion and $\n258\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which is included in other expenses.\n16. Equity\nPreferred Stock\nPreferred stock authorized, issued and outstanding was as follows:\nIn September 2020, MetLife, Inc. delivered a notice of partial redemption to the holders of MetLife, Inc.’s\n5.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate\nNon-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C (the “Series C preferred stock”) pursuant to which it would redeem\n1,000,000\nof its\n1,500,000\nshares of Series C preferred stock at a redemption price of $\n1,000\nper share, plus an amount equal to accrued but unpaid dividends on the Series C preferred stock to, but excluding, October 10, 2020, the redemption date.

Holders of the outstanding preferred stock are entitled to receive dividend payments only when, as and if declared by MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof. Dividends on the preferred stock are not cumulative or mandatory. Accordingly, if dividends are not declared on the preferred stock of the applicable series for any dividend period, then any accrued dividends for that dividend period will cease to accrue and be payable. If a dividend is not declared before the dividend payment date for any such dividend period, MetLife, Inc. will have no obligation to pay dividends accrued for such dividend period whether or not dividends are declared for any future period. No dividends may be paid or declared on MetLife, Inc.’s common stock (or any other securities ranking junior to the preferred stock) and MetLife, Inc. may not purchase, redeem, or otherwise acquire its common stock (or other such junior stock) unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on all outstanding shares of preferred stock, and any parity stock, have been declared and paid or provided for.\nThe table below presents the dividend rates of MetLife, Inc.’s preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2020:\nIn the table above, dividends on each series of preferred stock are payable in arrears for the periods specified, if declared.\n276\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n16.

Equity (continued)\nA “rating agency event” means that any nationally recognized statistical rating organization that then publishes a rating for MetLife, Inc. amends, clarifies or changes the criteria used to assign equity credit to securities like the Series D preferred stock, Series E preferred stock, Series F preferred stock or Series G preferred stock, which results in the lowering of the equity credit assigned to the security, or shortens the length of time that the security is assigned a particular level of equity credit. A “regulatory capital event” could occur as a result of a change or proposed change in laws, rules, regulations or regulatory standards, including capital adequacy rules (or the interpretation or application thereof) of the United States or any political subdivision thereof, including any capital regulator, including but not limited to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”), the Federal Insurance Office, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) or any state insurance regulator as may then have group-wide oversight of MetLife, Inc.’s regulatory capital, from those laws, rules, regulations or regulatory standards (or the interpretation or application thereof) in effect as of March 22, 2018, in the case of the Series D preferred stock, June 4, 2018, in the case of the Series E preferred stock, January 15, 2020, in the case of the Series F preferred stock, or September 10, 2020, in the case of the Series G preferred stock, that would create a more than insubstantial risk, as determined by MetLife, Inc., that the security would not be treated as “Tier 1 capital” or as capital with attributes similar to those of Tier 1 capital, except that a “regulatory capital event” will not include a change or proposed change (or the interpretation or application thereof) that would result in the adoption of any criteria substantially the same as the criteria in the capital adequacy rules of the Federal Reserve Board applicable to bank holding companies as of March 22, 2018, in the case of the Series D preferred stock, June 4, 2018, in the case of the Series E preferred stock, January 15, 2020, in the case of the Series F preferred stock, or September 10, 2020, in the case of the Series G preferred stock.\nThe per share and aggregate dividends declared for MetLife, Inc.’s preferred stock were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nCommon Stock\nIssuances\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, MetLife, Inc. issued\n3,933,989\nshares,\n5,856,057\nshares and\n3,114,141\nshares of its common stock for $\n153\nmillion, $\n199\nmillion and $\n108\nmillion, respectively, in connection with stock option exercises and other stock-based awards.

Equity (continued)\nUnder these authorizations, MetLife, Inc. may purchase its common stock from the MetLife Policyholder Trust, in the open market (including pursuant to the terms of a pre-set trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)), and in privately negotiated transactions. Common stock repurchases are subject to the discretion of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors and will depend upon the Company’s capital position, liquidity, financial strength and credit ratings, general market conditions, the market price of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock compared to management’s assessment of the stock’s underlying value, applicable regulatory approvals, and other legal and accounting factors.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, MetLife, Inc. repurchased\n26,361,487\nshares,\n49,131,501\nshares and\n88,029,138\nshares under these repurchase authorizations for $\n1.2\nbillion, $\n2.3\nbillion, and $\n4.0\nbillion, respectively. At December 31, 2020, MetLife, Inc. had $\n2.8\nbillion remaining under its December 2020 common stock repurchase authorization.\nDividends\nThe funding of the cash dividends and operating expenses of MetLife, Inc. is primarily provided by cash dividends from MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries. The statutory capital and surplus, or net assets, of MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions except to the extent that dividends are allowed to be paid in a given year without prior regulatory approval. Dividends exceeding these limitations can generally be made subject to regulatory approval. The nature and amount of these dividend restrictions, as well as the statutory capital and surplus of MetLife, Inc.’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries, are disclosed in “— Statutory Equity and Income” and “— Dividend Restrictions — Insurance Operations.” MetLife, Inc.’s principal non-U.S. insurance operations are branches or subsidiaries of American Life Insurance Company (“American Life”), a U.S. insurance subsidiary of the Company. In addition, the payment of dividends by MetLife, Inc. to its shareholders is also subject to restrictions. See “— Dividend Restrictions — MetLife, Inc.”\nStock-Based Compensation Plans\nPlans for Employees and Agents\nUnder the MetLife, Inc. 2015 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2015 Stock Plan”), MetLife, Inc. may grant awards to employees and agents in the form of Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Performance Shares or Performance Share Units, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, Cash-Based Awards and Stock-Based Awards (each, as applicable, as defined in the 2015 Stock Plan with reference to shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock (“Shares”)). Awards under the 2015 Stock Plan and its predecessor plan, the MetLife, Inc. 2005 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2005 Stock Plan”), were outstanding at December 31, 2020. MetLife, Inc. granted all awards to employees and agents in 2020 under the 2015 Stock Plan.\nThe aggregate number of Shares authorized for issuance under the 2015 Stock Plan at December 31, 2020 was\n33,701,004\n.\nMetLife recognizes compensation expense related to each award under the 2005 Stock Plan or 2015 Stock Plan in one of two ways:\n•\nFor cash-settled awards and the Performance Shares it granted in 2017 and 2018, MetLife remeasures the compensation expense quarterly.\n•\nFor other awards, MetLife recognizes an expense based on the number of awards it expects to vest, which represents the awards granted less expected forfeitures over the life of the award, as estimated at the date of grant. Unless MetLife observes a material deviation from the assumed forfeiture rate during the term in which the awards are expensed, MetLife recognizes any adjustment necessary to reflect differences in actual experience in the period the award becomes payable or exercisable.\nCompensation expense related to awards under the 2005 Stock Plan principally relates to the issuance of Stock Options. Under the 2015 Stock Plan, compensation expense principally relates to Stock Options, Unit Options, Performance Shares, Performance Units, Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Units. MetLife, Inc. granted the majority of each year’s awards under the 2005 Stock Plan and 2015 Stock Plan in the first quarter of the year.\nAwards that have become payable in Shares but the issuance of which has been deferred (“Deferred Shares”), payable to employees or agents related to awards under all plans equaled\n806,715\nShares at December 31, 2020.\n279\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n16. Equity (continued)\nMetLife granted cash-settled awards based in whole or in part on the price of Shares or changes in the price of Shares (“Phantom Stock-Based Awards”) under the MetLife, Inc. International Unit Option Incentive Plan, the MetLife International Performance Unit Incentive Plan, and the MetLife International Restricted Unit Incentive Plan prior to 2015, and under the 2015 Stock Plan in 2015 and later.\nPlans for Non-Management Directors\nUnder the MetLife, Inc. 2015 Non-Management Director Stock Compensation Plan (the “2015 Director Stock Plan”), MetLife, Inc. may grant non-management Directors of MetLife, Inc. awards in the form of nonqualified Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, or Stock-Based Awards (each, as applicable, as defined in the 2015 Director Stock Plan with reference to Shares).\nThe only awards MetLife, Inc. granted under the 2015 Director Stock Plan and its predecessor plan, the MetLife, Inc. 2005 Non-Management Director Stock Compensation Plan (the “2005 Director Stock Plan”), through December 31, 2020 were Stock-Based Awards that vested immediately. As a result, no awards under the 2005 Director Stock Plan or 2015 Director Stock Plan remained outstanding at December 31, 2020.\nThe aggregate number of Shares authorized for issuance under the 2015 Director Stock Plan at December 31, 2020 was\n1,548,274\n.\nMetLife recognizes compensation expense related to awards under the 2015 Director Stock Plan based on the number of Shares awarded.\nDeferred Shares payable to Directors related to awards under the 2005 Director Stock Plan, 2015 Director Stock Plan, or earlier applicable plans equaled\n298,808\nShares at December 31, 2020.\nCompensation Expense Related to Stock-Based Compensation\nThe components of compensation expense related to stock-based compensation includes compensation expense related to Phantom Stock-Based Awards and excludes the insignificant compensation expense related to the 2015 Director Stock Plan.

Equity (continued)\nEquity Awards\nStock Options\nStock Options are the contingent right of award holders to purchase Shares at a stated price for a limited time. All Stock Options have an exercise price equal to the closing price of a Share reported on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) on the date of grant and have a maximum term of\n10\nyears. The majority of Stock Options MetLife, Inc. has granted have become or will become exercisable at a rate of one-third of each award on each of the first\nthree\nanniversaries of the grant date. Other Stock Options have become or will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the grant date. Vesting is subject to continued service, except for employees who meet specified age and service criteria and in certain other limited circumstances.\nStock Option Activity\nA summary of the activity related to Stock Options was as follows:\n__________________\n(1)\nThe intrinsic value of each Stock Option is the closing price on a particular date less the exercise price of the Stock Option, so long as the difference is greater than zero. The aggregate intrinsic value of all outstanding Stock Options is computed using the closing Share price on December 31,\n2020 of $\n46.95\nand December 31, 2019 of $\n50.97\n, as applicable.\n(2)\nExpired options were exercisable, but unexercised, as of their expiration date.\n(3)\nForfeited awards were either (a) unvested or unexercisable at the end of the awardholder’s employment, where the awardholder did not meet the criteria for post-employment award continuation; or (b) held by awardholders the Company terminated from employment for cause as defined in the terms of the awards.\nMetLife estimates the fair value of Stock Options on the date of grant using a binomial lattice model. The significant assumptions the Company uses in its binomial lattice model include: expected volatility of the price of Shares; risk-free rate of return; dividend yield on Shares; exercise multiple; and the post-vesting termination rate.\nMetLife bases expected volatility on an analysis of historical prices of Shares and call options on Shares traded on the open market. The Company uses a weighted-average of the implied volatility for publicly-traded call options with the longest remaining maturity nearest to the money as of each valuation date and the historical volatility, calculated using monthly closing prices of Shares. The Company chose a monthly measurement interval for historical volatility as this interval reflects the Company’s view that employee option exercise decisions are based on longer-term trends in the price of the underlying Shares rather than on daily price movements.\nThe Company’s binomial lattice model incorporates different risk-free rates based on the imputed forward rates for U.S. Treasury Strips for each year over the contractual term of the option. The table below presents the full range of rates that were used for options granted during the respective periods.\n281\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n16. Equity (continued)\nThe Company determines dividend yield based on historical dividend distributions compared to the price of the underlying Shares as of the valuation date and held constant over the life of the Stock Option.\nThe Company’s binomial lattice model incorporates the term of the Stock Options, expected exercise behavior and a post-vesting termination rate, or the rate at which vested options are exercised or expire prematurely due to termination of employment. From these factors, the model derives an expected life of the Stock Option. The model’s exercise behavior is a multiple that reflects the ratio of stock price at the time of exercise over the exercise price of the Stock Option at the time the model expects holders to exercise. The model derives the exercise multiple from actual exercise activity. The model determines the post-vesting termination rate from actual exercise experience and expiration activity under the Incentive Plans.\nThe following table presents the weighted average assumptions, with the exception of risk-free rate (which is expressed as a range), that the model uses to determine the fair value of unexercised Stock Options:\nThe following table presents a summary of Stock Option exercise activity:\nPerformance Shares\nPerformance Shares are units that, if they vest, are multiplied by a performance factor to produce a number of final Shares payable. MetLife accounts for Performance Shares as equity awards. MetLife, Inc. does not credit Performance Shares with dividend-equivalents for dividends paid on Shares. Performance Share awards normally vest in their entirety at the end of the three-year performance period. Vesting is subject to continued service, except for employees who meet specified age and service criteria and in certain other limited circumstances.\nFor awards granted for the 2018 – 2020 and earlier performance periods in progress through December 31, 2020, the vested Performance Shares will be multiplied by a performance factor of\n0\n% to\n175\n% that the MetLife, Inc. Compensation Committee will determine in its discretion (subject to MetLife, Inc. meeting threshold performance goals related to its adjusted income or total shareholder return). In doing so, the Compensation Committee may consider MetLife, Inc.’s total shareholder return relative to the performance of its competitors and adjusted return on MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity relative to its financial plan. MetLife estimates the fair value of Performance Shares each quarter until they become payable.\n282\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n16. Equity (continued)\nFor awards granted for the 2019 – 2021 and later performance periods in progress through December 31, 2020, the vested Performance Shares will be multiplied by a performance factor of 0% to 175% that the MetLife, Inc. Compensation Committee will determine by (a) the Company’s annual adjusted return on equity performance over the three-year period compared to the Company’s three-year business plan goal; (b) the Company’s total shareholder return over the same three-year period compared to a peer group of companies; and (c) a cap of 100% if the Company’s total shareholder return for the three-year period is zero or less. The Compensation Committee will exclude the impact of a “Significant Event” from the Company’s adjusted return on equity or the business plan goal, to the extent the Committee determines in its informed judgment that the event changed the adjusted return on equity performance factor component. “Significant Events” include accounting changes, business combinations, restructuring, nonrecurring tax events, common share issuance or repurchases, catastrophes, litigation and regulatory settlements, asbestos and environment events, certain specified classes of non-coupon investments, and other significant nonrecurring, infrequent, or unusual items.\nThe performance factor for the 2017 - 2019 performance period was\n91.4\n%.\nRestricted Stock Units\nRestricted Stock Units are units that, if they vest, are payable in an equal number of Shares. MetLife accounts for Restricted Stock Units as equity awards. MetLife, Inc. does not credit Restricted Stock Units with dividend-equivalents for dividends paid on Shares. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of Restricted Stock Units is based upon the closing price of Shares on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends to be paid on that stock.\nThe majority of Restricted Stock Units normally vest in thirds on or shortly after the first three anniversaries of their grant date. Other Restricted Stock Units normally vest in their entirety on the third or later anniversary of their grant date. Vesting is subject to continued service, except for employees who meet specified age and service criteria and in certain other limited circumstances.\nPerformance Share and Restricted Stock Unit Activity\nThe following table presents a summary of Performance Share and Restricted Stock Unit activity:\n__________________\n(1)\nValues for awards outstanding at January 1, 2020, represent weighted average number of awards multiplied by the fair value per Share at December 31, 2019. Otherwise, all values represent weighted average of number of awards multiplied by the fair value per Share at December 31, 2020. Fair value of Restricted Stock Units on December 31, 2020 was equal to Grant Date fair value.\n(2)\nForfeited awards were either (a) unvested or unexercisable at the end of the awardholder’s employment, where the awardholder did not meet the criteria for post-employment award continuation; or (b) held by awardholders the Company terminated from employment for cause as defined in the terms of the awards.\n(3)\nIncludes both Shares paid and Deferred Shares for later payment.\nPerformance Share amounts above represent aggregate awards at target, and do not reflect potential increases or decreases that may result from the performance factor. At December 31, 2020, the performance period for the 2018 — 2020 Performance Share grants was completed, but the performance factor had not yet been determined. Included in the immediately preceding table are\n1,266,651\noutstanding Performance Shares to which the 2018 — 2020 performance factor will be applied.\n283\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n16. Equity (continued)\nLiability Awards (Phantom Stock-Based Awards)\nCertain MetLife subsidiaries have a liability for Phantom Stock-Based Awards in the form of Unit Options, Performance Units, and/or Restricted Units. These Share-based cash settled awards are recorded as liabilities until MetLife makes payment. The fair value of unsettled or unvested liability awards is re-measured at the end of each reporting period based on the change in fair value of one Share. The liability and corresponding expense are adjusted accordingly until the award is settled.\nUnit Options\nUnit Options are the contingent right of award holders to receive a cash payment equal to the closing price of a Share on the exercise date, less the closing price on the grant date, if the difference is greater than zero, for a limited time. All Unit Options have an exercise price equal to the closing price of a Share reported on the NYSE on the date of grant and have a maximum term of 10 years. The majority of Unit Options have become or will become eligible for exercise at a rate of one-third of each award on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. Other Unit Options have become or will become eligible for exercise on the third anniversary of the grant date. Vesting is subject to continued service, except for employees who meet specified age and service criteria and in certain other limited circumstances.\nPerformance Units\nPerformance Units are units that, if they vest, are multiplied by a performance factor to produce a number of final Performance Units which are payable in cash equal to the closing price of a Share on a date following the last day of the three-year performance period. Performance Units are accounted for as liability awards. MetLife, Inc. does not credit them with dividend-equivalents for dividends paid on Shares. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of Performance Units is based upon the closing price of a Share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends to be paid on that stock during the performance period. MetLife determines each performance period’s performance factor in the same way it does for the same performance period’s Performance Shares.\nSee “— Equity Awards — Performance Shares” for a discussion of the Performance Shares vesting period and performance factor calculation, which are also used for Performance Units.\nRestricted Units\nRestricted Units are units that, if they vest, are payable in cash equal to the closing price of a Share on the last day of the restriction period. The majority of Restricted Units normally vest in thirds on or shortly after the first three anniversaries of their grant date. Other Restricted Units normally vest in their entirety on the third or later anniversary of their grant date. Vesting is subject to continued service, except for employees who meet specified age and service criteria and in certain other limited circumstances. Restricted Units are accounted for as liability awards. MetLife, Inc. does not credit Restricted Units with dividend-equivalents for dividends paid on Shares. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of Restricted Units is based upon the closing price of a Share on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends to be paid on that stock during the performance period.\n284\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n16.

At December 31, 2020, the performance period for the 2018 - 2020 Performance Unit grants was completed, but the performance factor had not yet been determined. Included in the immediately preceding table are\n170,214\noutstanding Performance Units to which the 2018 - 2020 performance factor will be applied.\nStatutory Equity and Income\nThe states of domicile of MetLife, Inc.’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries each impose risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements that were developed by the NAIC. American Life does not write business in Delaware or any other U.S. state and, as such, is exempt from RBC requirements by Delaware law. Regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a company’s total adjusted capital, calculated in the manner prescribed by the NAIC (“TAC”) to its authorized control level RBC, calculated in the manner prescribed by the NAIC (“ACL RBC”), based on the statutory-based filed financial statements. Companies below specific trigger levels or ratios are classified by their respective levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. The minimum level of TAC before corrective action commences is twice ACL RBC (“Company Action Level RBC”). While not required by or filed with insurance regulators, the Company also calculates an internally defined combined RBC ratio (“Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio”), which is determined by dividing the sum of TAC for MetLife, Inc.’s principal U.S. insurance subsidiaries, excluding American Life, by the sum of Company Action Level RBC for such subsidiaries. The Company’s Statement-Based Combined RBC Ratio was\nin excess of 350%\nand\nin excess of 360%\nat December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, all non-exempted U.S. insurance subsidiaries individually exceeded Company Action Level RBC for all periods presented.\nMetLife, Inc.’s foreign insurance operations are regulated by applicable authorities of the jurisdictions in which each entity operates and are subject to minimum capital and solvency requirements in those jurisdictions before corrective action commences. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the adjusted capital of American Life’s insurance subsidiary in Japan, the Company’s largest foreign insurance operation, was\nin excess of four times the 200% solvency margin ratio\nthat would require corrective action. Excluding Japan, the aggregate required capital and surplus of the Company’s other foreign insurance operations was $\n3.9\nbillion and the aggregate actual regulatory capital and surplus of such operations was $\n9.6\nbillion as of the date of the most recent required capital adequacy calculation for each jurisdiction. The Company’s foreign insurance operations exceeded the minimum capital and solvency requirements as of the date of the most recent fiscal year-end capital adequacy calculation for each jurisdiction.\n285\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n16. Equity (continued)\nMetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries prepare statutory-basis financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the state of domicile or applicable foreign jurisdiction. The NAIC has adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting Principles (“Statutory Codification”). Statutory Codification is intended to standardize regulatory accounting and reporting to state insurance departments. However, statutory accounting principles continue to be established by individual state laws and permitted practices. Modifications by the various state insurance departments may impact the effect of Statutory Codification on the statutory capital and surplus of MetLife, Inc.’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries.\nStatutory accounting principles differ from GAAP primarily by charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred, establishing future policy benefit liabilities using different actuarial assumptions, reporting surplus notes as surplus instead of debt and valuing securities on a different basis.\nIn addition, certain assets are not admitted under statutory accounting principles and are charged directly to surplus. The most significant assets not admitted by the Company are net deferred income tax assets resulting from temporary differences between statutory accounting principles basis and tax basis not expected to reverse and become recoverable within three years. Further, statutory accounting principles do not give recognition to purchase accounting adjustments. MetLife, Inc.’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries have no material state prescribed accounting practices, except as described below.\nNew York has adopted certain prescribed accounting practices, primarily consisting of the continuous Commissioners’ Annuity Reserve Valuation Method, which impacts deferred annuities, and the New York Special Considerations Letter, which mandates certain assumptions in asset adequacy testing. The collective impact of these prescribed accounting practices decreased the statutory capital and surplus of MLIC by $\n1.6\nbillion and $\n1.2\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, compared to what capital and surplus would have been had it been measured under NAIC guidance.\nAmerican Life calculates its policyholder reserves on insurance written in each foreign jurisdiction in accordance with the reserve standards required by such jurisdiction. Additionally, American Life’s insurance subsidiaries are valued based on each respective subsidiary’s underlying local statutory equity, adjusted in a manner consistent with the reporting prescribed for its branch operations. The prescribed practice exempts American Life from calculating and disclosing the impact to its statutory capital and surplus.\nThe tables below present amounts from MetLife, Inc.’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries, which are derived from the statutory-basis financial statements as filed with the insurance regulators.\nStatutory net income (loss) was as follows:\n__________________\n(1)\nIn April 2018, Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company (“MTL”) merged with General American Life Insurance Company (“MTL Merger”). The surviving entity of the merger was MTL, which re-domesticated from Delaware to Nebraska immediately prior to the merger.\n286\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n16. Equity (continued)\nStatutory capital and surplus was as follows at:\nThe Company’s U.S. captive life reinsurance subsidiaries, which reinsure risks including the closed block, level premium term life and ULSG assumed from other MetLife subsidiaries, have no state prescribed accounting practices, except for MetLife Reinsurance Company of Vermont (“MRV”).\nMRV, with the explicit permission of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Vermont, has included, as admitted assets, the value of letters of credit serving as collateral for reinsurance credit taken by various affiliated cedants, in connection with reinsurance agreements entered into between MRV and the various affiliated cedants, which resulted in higher statutory capital and surplus of $\n2.0\nbillion at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. MRV’s RBC would have triggered a regulatory event without the use of the state prescribed practice.\nThe combined statutory net income (loss) of MetLife, Inc.’s U.S. captive life reinsurance subsidiaries was ($\n7\n) million, ($\n27\n) million and ($\n59\n) million for the years ended December 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and the combined statutory capital and surplus, including the aforementioned prescribed practice, was $\n691\nmillion and $\n695\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDividend Restrictions\nInsurance Operations\nThe table below sets forth the dividends permitted to be paid by MetLife, Inc.’s primary insurance subsidiaries without insurance regulatory approval and the actual dividends paid:\n__________________\n(1)\nReflects dividend amounts that may be paid by the end of 2021 without prior regulatory approval.\n(2)\nReflects all amounts paid, including those where regulatory approval was obtained as required.\n(3)\nIncludes a $\n341\nmillion non-cash dividend.\n(4)\nSee Note 3 for information regarding the pending disposition of MetLife P&C, which may impact the ability of MetLife P&C to pay a dividend to MetLife, Inc. in 2021.\n287\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n16. Equity (continued)\nUnder the New York State Insurance Law, MLIC is permitted, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay stockholder dividends to MetLife, Inc. in any calendar year based on either of two standards. Under one standard, MLIC is permitted, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay dividends out of earned surplus (defined as positive unassigned funds (surplus), excluding 85% of the change in net unrealized capital gains or losses (less capital gains tax), for the immediately preceding calendar year), in an amount up to the greater of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year, or (ii) its statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital gains), not to exceed 30% of surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year. In addition, under this standard, MLIC may not, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, pay any dividends in any calendar year immediately following a calendar year for which its net gain from operations, excluding realized capital gains, was negative. Under the second standard, if dividends are paid out of other than earned surplus, MLIC may, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, pay an amount up to the lesser of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year, or (ii) its statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital gains). In addition, MLIC will be permitted to pay a dividend to MetLife, Inc. in excess of the amounts allowed under both standards only if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the New York Superintendent of Financial Services (the “Superintendent”) and the Superintendent either approves the distribution of the dividend or does not disapprove the dividend within 30 days of its filing. Under the New York State Insurance Law, the Superintendent has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholder.\nUnder the Delaware Insurance Code, American Life is permitted, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay a stockholder dividend to MetLife, Inc. as long as the amount of the dividend, when aggregated with all other dividends in the preceding 12 months, does not exceed the greater of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year, or (ii) its statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital gains), not including pro rata distributions of American Life’s own securities. American Life will be permitted to pay a dividend to MetLife, Inc. in excess of the greater of such two amounts only if it files notice of the declaration of such a dividend and the amount thereof with the Delaware Commissioner of Insurance (the “Delaware Commissioner”) and the Delaware Commissioner either approves the distribution of the dividend or does not disapprove the distribution within 30 days of its filing. In addition, any dividend that exceeds earned surplus (defined as “unassigned funds (surplus)”) as of the immediately preceding calendar year requires insurance regulatory approval. Under the Delaware Insurance Code, the Delaware Commissioner has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders.\nUnder the Rhode Island Insurance Code, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company (“MPC”) is permitted, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay a stockholder dividend to MetLife, Inc. as long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends in any 12 month period does not exceed the lesser of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year, or (ii) net income, excluding realized capital gains, for the immediately preceding calendar year, not including pro rata distributions of MPC’s own securities. In determining whether a dividend is extraordinary, MPC may include carry forward net income from the previous two calendar years, excluding realized capital gains less dividends paid in the second and immediately preceding calendar years. MPC will be permitted to pay a dividend to MetLife, Inc. in excess of the lesser of such two amounts only if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the Rhode Island Commissioner of Insurance (the “Rhode Island Commissioner”) and the Rhode Island Commissioner either approves the distribution of the dividend or does not disapprove the distribution within 30 days of its filing. Under the Rhode Island Insurance Code, the Rhode Island Commissioner has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock property and casualty insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders.\n288\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n16. Equity (continued)\nUnder the Nebraska Insurance Code, MTL is permitted, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay a stockholder dividend to MetLife, Inc. as long as the amount of the dividend, when aggregated with all other dividends in the preceding 12 months, does not exceed the greater of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year, or (ii) its statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital gains), not including pro rata distributions of MTL’s own securities. MTL will be permitted to pay a dividend to MetLife, Inc. in excess of the greater of such two amounts only if it files notice of the declaration of such a dividend and the amount thereof with the Director of the Nebraska Department of Insurance (the “Nebraska Director”) and the Nebraska Director either approves the distribution of the dividend or does not disapprove the distribution within 30 days of its filing. In addition, any dividend that exceeds earned surplus (defined as “unassigned funds (surplus)” excluding unrealized capital gains) as of the immediately preceding calendar year requires insurance regulatory approval. Under the Nebraska Insurance Code, the Nebraska Director has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders.\nMetLife, Inc.\nThe declaration and payment of dividends are subject to the discretion of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors and will depend on its financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. In addition, the payment of dividends on MetLife, Inc.’s common stock, and MetLife, Inc.’s ability to repurchase its common stock, may be subject to restrictions described below arising under the terms of MetLife, Inc.’s Series A preferred stock and its junior subordinated debentures in situations where MetLife, Inc. may be experiencing financial stress, as described below. For purposes of this discussion, “junior subordinated debentures” are deemed to include MetLife, Inc.’s Fixed-to-Floating Rate Exchangeable Surplus Trust Securities, as discussed in Note 15.\n“Dividend Stopper” Provisions in the Preferred Stock and Junior Subordinated Debentures\nIf MetLife, Inc. has not paid the full dividends on its preferred stock for the latest completed dividend period, MetLife, Inc. may not repurchase or pay dividends on its common stock during a dividend period under so-called “dividend stopper” provisions. Further, MetLife, Inc.’s Series A preferred stock and its junior subordinated debentures contain provisions that would suspend the payment of preferred stock dividends and interest on junior subordinated debentures if MetLife, Inc. fails to meet certain RBC ratio, net income and stockholders’ equity tests at specified times, except to the extent of the net proceeds from the issuance of certain securities during specified periods. If Series A preferred stock dividends or interest on junior subordinated debentures are not paid, certain provisions in those instruments (including under “dividend stopper” provisions) may restrict MetLife, Inc. from repurchasing its common or preferred stock or paying dividends on its common or preferred stock and interest on its junior subordinated debentures.\nThe junior subordinated debentures further provide that MetLife, Inc. may, at its option and provided that certain conditions are met, defer payment of interest without giving rise to an event of default for periods of up to 10 years. In that case, after five years MetLife, Inc. would be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell equity securities to raise proceeds to pay the interest. MetLife, Inc. would not be subject to limitations on the number of deferral periods that MetLife, Inc. could begin, so long as all accrued and unpaid interest is paid with respect to prior deferral periods. If MetLife, Inc. were to defer payments of interest, the “dividend stopper” provisions in the junior subordinated debentures would thus prevent MetLife, Inc. from repurchasing or paying dividends on its common stock or other capital stock (including the preferred stock) during the period of deferral, subject to exceptions.\nMetLife, Inc. is a party to certain RCCs which limit its ability to eliminate these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase of junior subordinated debentures by requiring MetLife, Inc., with some limitations, to receive cash proceeds during a specified period from the sale of specified replacement securities prior to any repayment, redemption or purchase.

Such restructuring charges were as follows:\nIn addition to the above severance charges, the Company recognized lease and asset impairment charges of $\n0\n, $\n43\nmillion and $\n12\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n18. Employee Benefit Plans\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nCertain subsidiaries of MetLife, Inc. sponsor a U.S. qualified and various U.S. and non-U.S. nonqualified defined benefit pension plans covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements. U.S. pension benefits are provided utilizing either a traditional formula or cash balance formula. The traditional formula provides benefits that are primarily based upon years of credited service and final average earnings. The cash balance formula utilizes hypothetical or notional accounts which credit participants with benefits equal to a percentage of eligible pay, as well as interest credits, determined annually based upon the annual rate of interest on 30-year U.S. Treasury securities, for each account balance. In September 2018, the U.S. qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans were amended, effective January 1, 2023, to provide benefits accruals for all active participants under the cash balance formula and to cease future accruals under the traditional formula. The U.S. nonqualified pension plans provide supplemental benefits in excess of limits applicable to a qualified plan. The non-U.S. pension plans generally provide benefits based upon either years of credited service and earnings preceding retirement or points earned on job grades and other factors in years of service.\nThese subsidiaries also provide certain postemployment benefits and certain postretirement medical and life insurance benefits for U.S. and non-U.S. retired employees. U.S. employees of these subsidiaries who were hired prior to 2003 (or, in certain cases, rehired during or after 2003) and meet age and service criteria while working for one of the subsidiaries may become eligible for these other postretirement benefits, at various levels, in accordance with the applicable plans. Virtually all retirees, or their beneficiaries, contribute a portion of the total costs of postretirement medical benefits. U.S. employees hired after 2003 are not eligible for any employer subsidy for postretirement medical benefits.\nIn September 2018, the U.S. postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans were amended, effective January 1, 2023, to discontinue the accrual of the employer subsidy credits for eligible employees.\n293\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n18.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, significant sources of actuarial (gains) losses for pension and other postretirement benefits include the impact of changes to the financial assumptions of $\n1.2\nbillion and $\n66\nmillion, respectively, and plan experience of $\n103\nmillion and ($\n97\n) million, respectively.\n295\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n18. Employee Benefit Plans (continued)\nInformation for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans with PBOs and/or accumulated benefit obligations (“ABO”) or APBO in excess of plan assets was as follows at:\nNet Periodic Benefit Costs\nThe components of net periodic benefit costs and other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in OCI were as follows:\n296\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n18. Employee Benefit Plans (continued)\nAssumptions\nAssumptions used in determining benefit obligations for the U.S. plans were as follows:\nAssumptions used in determining net periodic benefit costs for the U.S. plans were as follows:\nThe weighted average discount rate for the U.S. plans is determined annually based on the yield, measured on a yield to worst basis, of a hypothetical portfolio constructed of high quality debt instruments available on the measurement date, which would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the aggregate PBO when due.\nThe weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the U.S. plans is based on anticipated performance of the various asset sectors in which the plans invest, weighted by target allocation percentages. Anticipated future performance is based on long-term historical returns of the plan assets by sector, adjusted for the long-term expectations on the performance of the markets. While the precise expected rate of return derived using this approach will fluctuate from year to year, the policy is to hold this long-term assumption constant as long as it remains within reasonable tolerance from the derived rate.\nThe weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for use in that plan’s valuation in 2021 is currently anticipated to be\n5.00\n% for U.S. pension benefits and\n3.87\n% for U.S. other postretirement benefits.\nThe weighted average interest crediting rate is determined annually based on the plan selected rate, long-term financial forecasts of that rate and the demographics of the plan participants.\n297\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n18. Employee Benefit Plans (continued)\nThe assumed healthcare costs trend rates used in measuring the APBO and net periodic benefit costs were as follows:\nPlan Assets\nCertain U.S. subsidiaries provide employees with benefits under various Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) benefit plans. These include qualified pension plans, postretirement medical plans and certain retiree life insurance coverage. The assets of these U.S. subsidiaries’ qualified pension plans are held in an insurance group annuity contract, and the vast majority of the assets of the postretirement medical plan are held in a trust which largely utilizes insurance contracts to hold the assets. All of these contracts are issued by the Company’s insurance affiliates, and the assets under the contracts are held in insurance separate accounts that have been established by the Company. The underlying assets of the separate accounts are principally comprised of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, fixed maturity securities AFS, equity securities, derivatives, real estate and private equity investments. The assets backing the retiree life coverage also utilize insurance contracts issued by the Company’s insurance affiliate and are held in a general account Life Insurance Funding Agreement.\nThe insurance contract provider engages investment management firms (“Managers”) to serve as sub-advisors for the separate accounts based on the specific investment needs and requests identified by the plan fiduciary. These Managers have portfolio management discretion over the purchasing and selling of securities and other investment assets pursuant to the respective investment management agreements and guidelines established for each insurance separate account. The assets of the qualified pension plans and postretirement medical plans (the “Invested Plans”) are well diversified across multiple asset categories and across a number of different Managers, with the intent of minimizing risk concentrations within any given asset category or with any of the given Managers.\nThe Invested Plans, other than those held in participant directed investment accounts, are managed in accordance with investment policies consistent with the longer-term nature of related benefit obligations and within prudent risk parameters. Specifically, investment policies are oriented toward (i) maximizing the Invested Plan’s funded status; (ii) minimizing the volatility of the Invested Plan’s funded status; (iii) generating asset returns that exceed liability increases; and (iv) targeting rates of return in excess of a custom benchmark and industry standards over appropriate reference time periods. These goals are expected to be met through identifying appropriate and diversified asset classes and allocations, ensuring adequate liquidity to pay benefits and expenses when due and controlling the costs of administering and managing the Invested Plan’s investments. Independent investment consultants are periodically used to evaluate the investment risk of the Invested Plan’s assets relative to liabilities, analyze the economic and portfolio impact of various asset allocations and management strategies and recommend asset allocations.\nDerivative contracts may be used to reduce investment risk, to manage duration and to replicate the risk/return profile of an asset or asset class. Derivatives may not be used to leverage a portfolio in any manner, such as to magnify exposure to an asset, asset class, interest rates or any other financial variable. Derivatives are also prohibited for use in creating exposures to securities, currencies, indices or any other financial variable that is otherwise restricted.\n298\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n18. Employee Benefit Plans (continued)\nThe table below summarizes the actual weighted average allocation of the estimated fair value of total plan assets by asset class at December 31 for the years indicated and the approved target allocation by major asset class at December 31, 2020 for the Invested Plans:\n__________________\n(1)\nU.S. other postretirement benefits do not reflect postretirement life’s plan assets invested in fixed maturity securities AFS.\n(2)\nEquity securities percentage includes derivative assets.\n(3)\nAlternative securities primarily include private equity and real estate funds.\nEstimated Fair Value\nThe pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets are categorized into a three-level fair value hierarchy, as described in Note 10, based upon the significant input with the lowest level in its valuation. The Level 2 asset category includes certain separate accounts that are primarily invested in liquid and readily marketable securities. The estimated fair value of such separate accounts is based upon reported NAV provided by fund managers and this value represents the amount at which transfers into and out of the respective separate account are effected. These separate accounts provide reasonable levels of price transparency and can be corroborated through observable market data. Directly held investments are primarily invested in U.S. and foreign government and corporate securities. The Level 3 asset category includes separate accounts that are invested in assets that provide little or no price transparency due to the infrequency with which the underlying assets trade and generally require additional time to liquidate in an orderly manner. Accordingly, the values for separate accounts invested in these alternative asset classes are based on inputs that cannot be readily derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\n299\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n18. Employee Benefit Plans (continued)\nThe pension and other postretirement plan assets measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding placement in the fair value hierarchy are summarized as follows:\n300\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n18.

Employee Benefit Plans (continued)\nExpected Future Contributions and Benefit Payments\nIt is the subsidiaries’ practice to make contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan to comply with minimum funding requirements of ERISA. In accordance with such practice, no contributions are expected to be required for 2021. The subsidiaries do not expect to make any discretionary contributions to the qualified pension plan in 2021. For information on employer contributions, see “— Obligations and Funded Status.”\nBenefit payments due under the U.S. nonqualified pension plans are primarily funded from the subsidiaries’ general assets as they become due under the provisions of the plans, and therefore benefit payments equal employer contributions. The U.S. subsidiaries expect to make contributions of $\n74\nmillion to fund the benefit payments in 2021.\nPostretirement benefits are either: (i) not vested under law; (ii) a non-funded obligation of the subsidiaries; or (iii) both. Current regulations do not require funding for these benefits. The subsidiaries use their general assets, net of participant’s contributions, to pay postretirement medical claims as they come due. As permitted under the terms of the governing trust document, the subsidiaries may be reimbursed from plan assets for postretirement medical claims paid from their general assets. The U.S. subsidiaries expect to make contributions of $\n28\nmillion towards benefit obligations in 2021 to pay postretirement medical claims.\nGross benefit payments for the next 10 years, which reflect expected future service where appropriate, are expected to be as follows:\nDefined Contribution Plans\nCertain subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution plans under which a portion of employee contributions are matched. These subsidiaries contributed $\n95\nmillion, $\n96\nmillion and $\n63\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n19.

This excludes $\n12\nmillion of tax provision at the U.S. statutory rate for a total tax reform charge of $\n66\nmillion.\n(8)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, other includes tax charges of $\n69\nmillion related to the non-deductible loss incurred on the mark-to-market and exchange of FVO Brighthouse Common Stock and $\n18\nmillion related to a non-deductible Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act excise tax, offset by a tax benefit of $\n36\nmillion related to a non-cash transfer of assets from a wholly-owned U.K. subsidiary to its U.S. parent.\nIn December 2017, U.S. Tax Reform was signed into law. U.S. Tax Reform includes numerous changes in tax law, including a permanent reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from\n35\n% to\n21\n%, which took effect for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. U.S. Tax Reform moves the United States from a worldwide tax system to a participation exemption system by providing corporations a 100% dividends received deduction for dividends distributed by a controlled foreign corporation. To transition to that new system, U.S. Tax Reform imposed a one-time deemed repatriation tax on unremitted earnings and profits at a rate of\n8.0\n% for illiquid assets and\n15.5\n% for cash and cash equivalents.\nThe Company recorded estimates of the impacts of U.S. Tax Reform in the period of enactment, the fourth quarter of 2017. In 2018, these estimates were updated in accordance with SAB 118. However, the impact of certain provisions of U.S. Tax Reform remains uncertain. For instance, many regulations under the new law have not been finalized or have only recently been finalized, including certain rules on international taxation. As a result, the Company continued to report additional revisions resulting from U.S. Tax Reform in 2019.\nThe incremental financial statement impact related to U.S. Tax Reform was as follows:\nIn accordance with SAB 118, the Company recorded provisional amounts for certain items for which the income tax accounting was not complete. For these items, the Company recorded a reasonable estimate of the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform. The estimates were reported as provisional amounts during the measurement period, which did not exceed one year from the date of enactment of U.S. Tax Reform. In 2018, the Company reflected adjustments to its provisional amounts upon obtaining, preparing, or analyzing additional information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the enactment date that, if known, would have affected the income tax effects initially reported as provisional amounts. While the SAB 118 provisional measurement period ended December 31, 2018, the Company continued to revise certain U.S. Tax Reform amounts in 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the following items were considered provisional estimates due to complexities and ambiguities in U.S. Tax Reform which resulted in incomplete accounting for the tax effects of these provisions. Further guidance, either legislative or interpretive, and analysis were completed and updates were made to complete the accounting for these items during the measurement period as of December 31, 2018 and subsequent to the measurement period as of December 31, 2019:\n304\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n19. Income Tax (continued)\n•\nDeemed Repatriation Transition Tax - In 2018, the IRS issued proposed regulations related to the transition tax. As a result, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded a $\n468\nmillion charge. In 2019, as a result of executing a binding agreement with the IRS, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $\n317\nmillion to settle this matter. This agreement resolved uncertainty regarding the taxation of certain dividends from certain foreign subsidiaries paid prior to U.S. Tax Reform.\n•\nGILTI - U.S. Tax Reform imposes a minimum tax on GILTI, which is generally the excess income of foreign subsidiaries over a 10% rate of routine return on tangible business assets. In 2018, the Company established an accounting policy in which it treats taxes due on GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred. Accordingly, the Company recorded tax charges of $\n43\nmillion, $\n12\nmillion and $\n45\nmillion related to this income for the periods ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n•\nAlternative Minimum Tax Credits - U.S. Tax Reform eliminates the corporate alternative minimum tax and allows for minimum tax credit carryforwards to be used to offset future regular tax or to be refunded 50% each tax year beginning in 2018, with any remaining balance fully refunded in 2021. However, pursuant to the requirements of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended, refund payments issued for corporations claiming refundable prior year alternative minimum tax credits are subject to a sequestration rate of\n6.2\n%. The application of this fee to refunds in future years is subject to further guidance. Additionally, the sequestration reduction rate in effect at the time is subject to uncertainty. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company determined that\nno\nadditional adjustment was required. In early 2019, the IRS issued guidance indicating that for years beginning after December 31, 2017, refund payments and credit elect and refund offset transactions due to refundable alternative minimum tax credits will not be subject to the sequestration fee. Accordingly, to reflect this guidance the Company recorded a $\n9\nmillion tax benefit in 2019.\n•\nTax Credit Partnerships - The reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate due to U.S. Tax Reform required adjustments for multiple investment portfolios, including tax credit partnerships and tax-advantaged leveraged leases. Certain tax credit partnership investments derive returns in part from income tax credits. The Company recognizes changes in tax attributes at the partnership level when reported by the investee in its financial information. The Company did not receive the necessary investee financial information to determine the impact of U.S. Tax Reform on the tax attributes of its tax credit partnership investments until the third quarter of 2018. Accordingly, prior to the third quarter of 2018, the Company applied prior law to these equity method investments in accordance with SAB 118. For the year ended December 31, 2018, after receiving additional investee information, a reduction in tax credit partnerships’ equity method income of $\n46\nmillion, net of income tax, was included in net investment income. The tax-advantaged leveraged lease portfolio is valued on an after-tax yield basis. In 2018, the Company received third party data that was used to complete a comprehensive review of its portfolio to determine the full and complete impact of U.S. Tax Reform on these investments. As a result of this review, a tax benefit of $\n125\nmillion was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018. No additional adjustment was required for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n305\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n19. Income Tax (continued)\nU.S. Tax Reform required the Company to recognize a transition tax on all previously unremitted non-U.S. earnings. However, the Company has not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on the remaining excess of book bases over tax bases of certain investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. The amount of deferred tax liability related to the Company’s remaining basis difference in these non-U.S. subsidiaries is $\n281\nmillion at December 31, 2020.\nDeferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Net deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following at:\n__________________\n(1)\nThe Company has recorded a deferred tax asset of $\n301\nmillion related to U.S. state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and an offsetting valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2020. Certain net operating loss carryforwards will expire between 2021 and 2040, whereas others have an unlimited carryforward period.\n(2)\nTax credit carryforwards for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflect general business credits expiring between 2037 and 2040 and are reduced by $\n94\nmillion related to unrecognized tax benefits.\n(3)\nOn the consolidated balance sheet for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $\n11,008\nmillion and $\n9,097\nmillion, respectively, is reported in Deferred income tax liability for jurisdictions in a net deferred income tax liability position and $\n94\nmillion and $\n65\nmillion, respectively, of a deferred income tax asset is reported in Other assets for jurisdictions in a net deferred income tax asset position.\nThe Company files income tax returns with the U.S. federal government and various U.S. state and local jurisdictions, as well as non-U.S. jurisdictions. The Company is under continuous examination by the IRS and other tax authorities in jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business operations. The income tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction and subsidiary. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local income tax examinations for years prior to 2010. For tax years 2007 through 2009, the Company has established adequate reserves for payment of tax liabilities resulting from the completed IRS audit of 2007-2009 which is expected to be settled in 2021. In material non-U.S. jurisdictions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations for years prior to 2013.\n306\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n19. Income Tax (continued)\nThe Company filed refund claims in 2017 with the IRS for 2000 through 2002 to recover tax and interest predominantly related to the disallowance of certain foreign tax credits for which the Company received a statutory notice of deficiency in 2015 and paid the tax thereon. The disallowed foreign tax credits relate to certain non-U.S. investments held by MLIC in support of its life insurance business through a United Kingdom investment subsidiary that was structured as a joint venture until early 2009. In 2020, the Company received refunds from these claims filed in 2017, and as a result, the Company recorded a $\n28\nmillion interest benefit ($\n22\nmillion, net of tax) included in other expenses.\nFor tax years 2000 through 2002 and tax years 2007 through 2009, the Company entered into binding agreements with the IRS in 2019 under which all remaining issues regarding the foreign tax credit matter noted above were resolved. Accordingly, in 2019, the Company recorded a non-cash benefit to net income of $\n226\nmillion, net of tax, comprised of a $\n158\nmillion tax benefit recorded in provision for income tax expense (benefit) and a $\n86\nmillion interest benefit ($\n68\nmillion, net of tax) included in other expenses. For tax years 2003 through 2006, the Company entered into binding agreements with the IRS in 2018 under which all remaining issues, including the foreign tax credit matter noted above, were resolved. Accordingly, in 2018, the Company recorded a non-cash benefit to net income of $\n349\nmillion, net of tax, comprised of a $\n168\nmillion tax benefit recorded in provision for income tax expense (benefit) and a $\n229\nmillion interest benefit ($\n181\nmillion, net of tax) included in other expenses.\nThe Company’s overall liability for unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease in the next 12 months. For example, U.S. federal tax legislation and regulation could impact unrecognized tax benefits. A reasonable estimate of the increase or decrease cannot be made at this time. However, the Company continues to believe that the ultimate resolution of the pending issues will not result in a material change to its consolidated financial statements, although the resolution of income tax matters could impact the Company’s effective tax rate for a particular future period.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:\n__________________\n(1)    The increase in 2018 is primarily related to the deemed repatriation transition tax and related IRS regulations.\n(2)    The decreases in 2019 and 2018 are primarily related to non-cash benefits from tax audit settlements.\n(3)    The decreases in 2019 and 2018 are primarily related to the tax audit settlement, of which $\n377\nmillion and $\n284\nmillion, respectively, was reclassified to the current income tax payable account.\nThe Company classifies interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense, included within other expenses.\n307\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n19. Income Tax (continued)\nInterest was as follows:\n__________________\n(1)    The decreases in 2019 and 2018 are primarily related to the tax audit settlement, of which $\n60\nmillion and $\n168\nmillion, respectively, was recorded in other expenses and $\n119\nmillion and $\n273\nmillion, respectively, was reclassified to the current income tax payable account.\n308\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n20. Earnings Per Common Share\nThe following table presents the weighted average shares, basic earnings per common share and diluted earnings per common share:\n309\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n21. Contingencies, Commitments and Guarantees\nContingencies\nLitigation\nThe Company is a defendant in a large number of litigation matters. Putative or certified class action litigation and other litigation and claims and assessments against the Company, in addition to those discussed below and those otherwise provided for in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, have arisen in the course of the Company’s business, including, but not limited to, in connection with its activities as an insurer, mortgage lending bank, employer, investor, investment advisor, broker-dealer, and taxpayer.\nThe Company also receives and responds to subpoenas or other inquiries seeking a broad range of information from state regulators, including state insurance commissioners; state attorneys general or other state governmental authorities; federal regulators, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; federal governmental authorities, including congressional committees; and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, as well as from local and national regulators and government authorities in jurisdictions outside the United States where the Company conducts business. The issues involved in information requests and regulatory matters vary widely, but can include inquiries or investigations concerning the Company’s compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations. The Company cooperates in these inquiries.\nIn some of the matters, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Modern pleading practice in the United States permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary damages or other relief. Jurisdictions may permit claimants not to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit claimants to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the trial court. In addition, jurisdictions may permit plaintiffs to allege monetary damages in amounts well exceeding reasonably possible verdicts in the jurisdiction for similar matters. This variability in pleadings, together with the Company’s actual experience in litigating or resolving through settlement numerous claims over an extended period of time, demonstrates to management that the monetary relief which may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to its merits or disposition value.\nIt is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings. The Company establishes liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities have been established for a number of the matters noted below. In certain circumstances where liabilities have been established there may be coverage under one or more corporate insurance policies, pursuant to which there may be an insurance recovery. Insurance recoveries are recognized as gains when any contingencies relating to the insurance claim have been resolved, which is the earlier of when the gains are realized or realizable. It is possible that some of the matters could require the Company to pay damages or make other expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could not be reasonably estimated at December 31, 2020. While the potential future charges could be material in the particular quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on information currently known to management, management does not believe any such charges are likely to have a material effect on the Company’s financial position. Given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nMatters as to Which an Estimate Can Be Made\nFor some of the matters disclosed below, the Company is able to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss. For matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, the Company has not made an accrual. As of December 31, 2020, the Company estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts accrued for these matters to be $\n0\nto $\n200\nmillion.\n310\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n21. Contingencies, Commitments and Guarantees (continued)\nMatters as to Which an Estimate Cannot Be Made\nFor other matters disclosed below, the Company is not currently able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. The Company is often unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss until developments in such matters have provided sufficient information to support an assessment of the range of possible loss, such as quantification of a damage demand from plaintiffs, discovery from other parties and investigation of factual allegations, rulings by the court on motions or appeals, analysis by experts, and the progress of settlement negotiations. On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant information with respect to litigation contingencies and updates its accruals, disclosures and estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of loss based on such reviews.\nAsbestos-Related Claims\nMLIC is and has been a defendant in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts. These suits principally allege that the plaintiff or plaintiffs suffered personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos and seek both actual and punitive damages. MLIC has never engaged in the business of manufacturing, producing, distributing or selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products nor has MLIC issued liability or workers’ compensation insurance to companies in the business of manufacturing, producing, distributing or selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products. The lawsuits principally have focused on allegations with respect to certain research, publication and other activities of one or more of MLIC’s employees during the period from the 1920s through approximately the 1950s and allege that MLIC learned or should have learned of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among other things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those health risks. MLIC believes that it should not have legal liability in these cases. The outcome of most asbestos litigation matters, however, is uncertain and can be impacted by numerous variables, including differences in legal rulings in various jurisdictions, the nature of the alleged injury and factors unrelated to the ultimate legal merit of the claims asserted against MLIC. MLIC employs a number of resolution strategies to manage its asbestos loss exposure, including seeking resolution of pending litigation by judicial rulings and settling individual or groups of claims or lawsuits under appropriate circumstances.\nClaims asserted against MLIC have included negligence, intentional tort and conspiracy concerning the health risks associated with asbestos. MLIC’s defenses (beyond denial of certain factual allegations) include that: (i) MLIC owed no duty to the plaintiffs — it had no special relationship with the plaintiffs and did not manufacture, produce, distribute or sell the asbestos products that allegedly injured plaintiffs; (ii) plaintiffs did not rely on any actions of MLIC; (iii) MLIC’s conduct was not the cause of the plaintiffs’ injuries; (iv) plaintiffs’ exposure occurred after the dangers of asbestos were known; and (v) the applicable time with respect to filing suit has expired. During the course of the litigation, certain trial courts have granted motions dismissing claims against MLIC, while other trial courts have denied MLIC’s motions. There can be no assurance that MLIC will receive favorable decisions on motions in the future. While most cases brought to date have settled, MLIC intends to continue to defend aggressively against claims based on asbestos exposure, including defending claims at trials.\nThe approximate total number of asbestos personal injury claims pending against MLIC as of the dates indicated, the approximate number of new claims during the years ended on those dates and the approximate total settlement payments made to resolve asbestos personal injury claims at or during those years are set forth in the following table:\n__________________\n(1)\nSettlement payments represent payments made by MLIC during the year in connection with settlements made in that year and in prior years. Amounts do not include MLIC’s attorneys’ fees and expenses.\nThe number of asbestos cases that may be brought, the aggregate amount of any liability that MLIC may incur, and the total amount paid in settlements in any given year are uncertain and may vary significantly from year to year.\n311\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n21. Contingencies, Commitments and Guarantees (continued)\nThe ability of MLIC to estimate its ultimate asbestos exposure is subject to considerable uncertainty, and the conditions impacting its liability can be dynamic and subject to change. The availability of reliable data is limited and it is difficult to predict the numerous variables that can affect liability estimates, including the number of future claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible impact of tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against MLIC when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known, and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts.\nThe ability to make estimates regarding ultimate asbestos exposure declines significantly as the estimates relate to years further in the future. In the Company’s judgment, there is a future point after which losses cease to be probable and reasonably estimable. It is reasonably possible that the Company’s total exposure to asbestos claims may be materially greater than the asbestos liability currently accrued and that future charges to income may be necessary. While the potential future charges could be material in the particular quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on information currently known by management, management does not believe any such charges are likely to have a material effect on the Company’s financial position.\nThe Company believes adequate provision has been made in its consolidated financial statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for asbestos-related claims. MLIC’s recorded asbestos liability is based on its estimation of the following elements, as informed by the facts presently known to it, its understanding of current law and its past experiences: (i) the probable and reasonably estimable liability for asbestos claims already asserted against MLIC, including claims settled but not yet paid; (ii) the probable and reasonably estimable liability for asbestos claims not yet asserted against MLIC, but which MLIC believes are reasonably probable of assertion; and (iii) the legal defense costs associated with the foregoing claims. Significant assumptions underlying MLIC’s analysis of the adequacy of its recorded liability with respect to asbestos litigation include: (i) the number of future claims; (ii) the cost to resolve claims; and (iii) the cost to defend claims.\nMLIC reevaluates on a quarterly and annual basis its exposure from asbestos litigation, including studying its claims experience, reviewing external literature regarding asbestos claims experience in the United States, assessing relevant trends impacting asbestos liability and considering numerous variables that can affect its asbestos liability exposure on an overall or per claim basis. These variables include bankruptcies of other companies involved in asbestos litigation, legislative and judicial developments, the number of pending claims involving serious disease, the number of new claims filed against it and other defendants and the jurisdictions in which claims are pending. Based upon its regular reevaluation of its exposure from asbestos litigation, MLIC has updated its recorded liability for asbestos-related claims to $\n425\nmillion at December 31, 2020.\nCity of Westland Police and Fire Retirement System v. MetLife, Inc., et. al. (S.D.N.Y., filed January 12, 2012)\nPlaintiff filed this class action on behalf of a class of persons who either purchased MetLife, Inc. common shares between February 9, 2011, and October 6, 2011, or purchased or acquired MetLife, Inc. common stock in the Company’s August 3, 2010 offering or the Company’s March 4, 2011 offering. Plaintiff alleges that MetLife, Inc. and several current and former directors and executive officers of MetLife, Inc. violated the Securities Act of 1933, as well as the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by issuing, or causing MetLife, Inc. to issue, materially false and misleading statements concerning MetLife, Inc.’s potential liability for millions of dollars in insurance benefits that should have purportedly been paid to beneficiaries or escheated to the states. The parties reached an agreement on a class settlement of the case, and on June 17, 2020, plaintiff filed with the district court a motion to approve notice of the proposed settlement to the classes. The Company has accrued the full amount of the settlement payment. On November 24, 2020, the district court approved notice of the proposed settlement to the classes.\n312\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n21. Contingencies, Commitments and Guarantees (continued)\nJulian & McKinney v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (S.D.N.Y., filed February 9, 2017)\nPlaintiffs filed this putative class and collective action on behalf of themselves and all current and former long-term disability (“LTD”) claims specialists between February 2011 and the present for alleged wage and hour violations under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the New York Labor Law, and the Connecticut Minimum Wage Act. The suit alleges that MLIC improperly reclassified the plaintiffs and similarly situated LTD claims specialists from non-exempt to exempt from overtime pay in November 2013. As a result, they and members of the putative class were no longer eligible for overtime pay even though they allege they continued to work more than 40 hours per week. Plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, as well as other relief. On March 22, 2018, the court conditionally certified the case as a collective action, requiring that notice be mailed to LTD claims specialists who worked for MLIC from February 8, 2014 to the present. MLIC intends to defend this action vigorously.\nTotal Asset Recovery Services, LLC. v. MetLife, Inc., et al. (Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, filed December 27, 2017)\nTotal Asset Recovery Services (the “Relator”) brought an action under the qui tam provision of the New York False Claims Act (the “Act”) on behalf of itself and the State of New York. The Relator originally filed this action under seal in 2010, and the complaint was unsealed on December 19, 2017. The Relator alleges that MetLife, Inc., MLIC, and several other insurance companies violated the Act by filing false unclaimed property reports with the State of New York from 1986 to 2017, to avoid having to escheat the proceeds of more than 25,000 life insurance policies, including policies for which the defendants escheated funds as part of their demutualizations in the late 1990s. The Relator seeks treble damages and other relief. On April 3, 2019, the court granted MetLife, Inc.’s and MLIC’s motion to dismiss and dismissed the complaint in its entirety. The Relator filed an appeal with the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court, First Department. On December 10, 2020, the Appellate Division reversed the court’s order granting MetLife, Inc. and MLIC’s motion to dismiss and remanded the case to the trial court where the Relator’s counsel will be permitted to file an amended complaint.\nMatters Related to Group Annuity Benefits and Assumed Variable Annuity Guarantee Reserves\nIn 2018, the Company announced that it identified two material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting related to the practices and procedures for estimating reserves for certain group annuity benefits and the calculation of reserves associated with certain variable annuity guarantees assumed from the former operating joint venture in Japan. Several regulators have made inquiries into these issues and it is possible that other jurisdictions may pursue similar investigations or inquiries. The Company is exposed to lawsuits, and could be exposed to additional legal actions relating to these issues. These may result in payments, including damages, fines, penalties, interest and other amounts assessed or awarded by courts or regulatory authorities under applicable escheat, tax, securities, ERISA, or other laws or regulations. The Company could incur significant costs in connection with these actions.\nLitigation Matters\nParchmann v. MetLife, Inc., et. al. (E.D.N.Y., filed February 5, 2018)\nPlaintiff filed this putative class action seeking to represent a class of persons who purchased MetLife, Inc. common stock from February 27, 2013 through January 29, 2018. Plaintiff alleges that MetLife, Inc., its former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, and its former Chief Financial Officer violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by issuing materially false and/or misleading financial statements. Plaintiff alleges that MetLife’s practices and procedures for estimating reserves for certain group annuity benefits were inadequate, and that MetLife had inadequate internal control over financial reporting. Plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. On January 11, 2021, the court granted MetLife’s motion to dismiss and dismissed the complaint in its entirety. Plaintiff filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n313\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n21. Contingencies, Commitments and Guarantees (continued)\nDerivative Actions and Demands\nShareholders, seeking to sue derivatively on behalf of MetLife, Inc., commenced three separate actions against certain current and former members of the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors and/or certain current and former officers of MetLife, Inc., alleging that, among other things, they breached their fiduciary and other duties to the Company. In\nKates v. Kandarian, et al.\n(E.D.N.Y., filed January 18, 2019, transferred to D. Del. July 8, 2019) and\nFelt, et al. v. Grise, et al.\n(D. Del., filed April 29, 2019), plaintiffs allege that the defendants disseminated or approved public statements that failed to disclose that MetLife’s practices and procedures for estimating reserves for certain group annuity benefits were inadequate and that MetLife had inadequate internal control over financial reporting. In\nLifschitz v. Kandarian, et al.\n(Del. Ch., filed June 19, 2019), plaintiff alleges that the MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors knew or should have known that MetLife’s practices and procedures for estimating reserves for certain group annuity benefits were inadequate.\nFelt and Lifschitz\nhave been consolidated in the Court of Chancery in Delaware under the caption\nIn re: MetLife, Inc. Derivative Litigation.\nIn all of these actions, plaintiffs allege that because of the defendants’ breaches of duty, MetLife, Inc. has incurred damage to its reputation and has suffered other unspecified damages. On August 17, 2020, the court dismissed the complaint in\nIn re: MetLife, Inc. Derivative Litigation,\nand on September 8, 2020, the court dismissed the complaint in\nKates\n. Plaintiffs in\nIn re: MetLife, Inc. Derivative Litigation\nhave filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware, and on October 8, 2020, plaintiffs in\nKates\nfiled a third amended complaint with the district court.\nThe MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors received six letters, dated March 28, 2018, May 11, 2018, July 16, 2018, December 20, 2018, February 5, 2019, and April 7, 2020, written on behalf of individual stockholders, demanding that MetLife, Inc. take action against current and former directors and officers for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and/or investigate, remediate, and recover damages allegedly suffered by the Company as a result of (i) the Company’s allegedly inadequate practices and procedures for estimating reserves for certain group annuity benefits, (ii) the Company’s allegedly inadequate internal controls over financial reporting and corporate governance practices and procedures, and (iii) the alleged dissemination of false or misleading information related to these issues. The MetLife, Inc. Board of Directors appointed a special committee to investigate the allegations set forth in these six letters.\nInsolvency Assessments\nMany jurisdictions in which the Company is admitted to transact business require insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers or those that may become impaired, insolvent or fail. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular jurisdiction on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer engaged. In addition, certain jurisdictions have government owned or controlled organizations providing life, health and property and casualty insurance to their citizens, whose activities could place additional stress on the adequacy of guaranty fund assessments. Many of these organizations have the power to levy assessments similar to those of the guaranty associations. Some jurisdictions permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets.\nAssets and liabilities held for insolvency assessments were as follows:\n314\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n21. Contingencies, Commitments and Guarantees (continued)\nCommitments\nMortgage Loan Commitments\nThe Company commits to lend funds under mortgage loan commitments. The amounts of these mortgage loan commitments were $\n3.3\nbillion and $\n4.1\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCommitments to Fund Partnership Investments, Bank Credit Facilities, Bridge Loans and Private Corporate Bond Investments\nThe Company commits to fund partnership investments and to lend funds under bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. The amounts of these unfunded commitments were $\n8.5\nbillion and $\n8.1\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nGuarantees\nIn the normal course of its business, the Company has provided certain indemnities, guarantees and commitments to third parties such that it may be required to make payments now or in the future. In the context of acquisition, disposition, investment and other transactions, the Company has provided indemnities and guarantees, including those related to tax, environmental and other specific liabilities and other indemnities and guarantees that are triggered by, among other things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by the Company. In addition, in the normal course of business, the Company provides indemnifications to counterparties in contracts with triggers similar to the foregoing, as well as for certain other liabilities, such as third-party lawsuits. These obligations are often subject to time limitations that vary in duration, including contractual limitations and those that arise by operation of law, such as applicable statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation under the indemnities and guarantees is subject to a contractual limitation ranging from less than $\n1\nmillion to $\n329\nmillion, with a cumulative maximum of $\n549\nmillion, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations are not subject to limitations, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these guarantees in the future. Management believes that it is unlikely the Company will have to make any material payments under these indemnities, guarantees, or commitments.\nIn addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers as provided in its charters and by-laws. Also, the Company indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of their representation of the Company’s interests. Since these indemnities are generally not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these indemnities in the future.\nThe Company also has minimum fund yield requirements on certain pension funds. Since these guarantees are not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could become due under these guarantees in the future.\nThe Company’s recorded liabilities were $\n20\nmillion and $\n6\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for indemnities, guarantees and commitments.\n315\nMetLife, Inc.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)\n22.

Amortized cost for fixed maturity securities AFS, mortgage loans and short-term investments represents original cost reduced by repayments and adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount; for equity securities, cost represents original cost; for real estate, cost represents original cost reduced by impairments and depreciation; for real estate joint ventures and other limited partnerships interests, cost represents original cost reduced for impairments or original cost adjusted for equity in earnings and distributions.\n317\nMetLife, Inc.\nSchedule II\nCondensed Financial Information\n(Parent Company Only)\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019\n(In millions, except share and per share data)\nSee accompanying notes to the condensed financial information.\n318\nMetLife, Inc.\nSchedule II\nCondensed Financial Information — (continued)\n(Parent Company Only)\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes to the condensed financial information.\n319\nMetLife, Inc.\nSchedule II\nCondensed Financial Information — (continued)\n(Parent Company Only)\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\n(In millions)\n320\nMetLife, Inc.\nSchedule II\nCondensed Financial Information — (continued)\n(Parent Company Only)\nFor the Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\n(In millions)\n321\nMetLife, Inc.\nSchedule II\nNotes to the Condensed Financial Information\n(Parent Company Only)\n1. Basis of Presentation\nThe condensed financial information of MetLife, Inc. (parent company only) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries and the notes thereto (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”). These condensed unconsolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows for MetLife, Inc. Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\nThe preparation of these condensed unconsolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions. The most important of these estimates and assumptions relate to the fair value measurements, the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets and the provision for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits, which may affect the amounts reported in the condensed unconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n2. Investment in Subsidiaries\nIn December 2020, MetLife, Inc. paid $\n1.8\nbillion in cash in connection with the acquisition of Versant Health. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n3\n. Loans to Subsidiaries\nMetLife, Inc. lends funds as necessary, through credit agreements or otherwise to its subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their capital requirements or to provide liquidity. Payments of interest and principal on surplus notes of regulated subsidiaries, which are subordinate to all other obligations of the issuing company, may be made only with the prior approval of the insurance department of the state of domicile.\nInterest income earned on loans to subsidiaries of $\n2\nmillion, $\n3\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, is included in net investment income.\n322\nMetLife, Inc.\nSchedule II\nNotes to the Condensed Financial Information — (continued)\n(Parent Company Only)\n4\n.

Support Agreements (continued)\nMetLife, Inc. guarantees obligations arising from OTC-bilateral derivatives of MrB. MrB is exposed to various risks relating to their ongoing business operations, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, credit and equity market.

    "text": "Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. The Company has designed these controls and procedures to ensure that information the Company is required to disclose in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to Company management, including the CEO and CFO as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement, including the CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020.\nThere were no changes to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. In fulfilling this responsibility, management’s estimates and judgments must assess the expected benefits and related costs of control procedures. The Company’s internal control objectives include providing management with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the Company has safeguarded assets against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the Company has executed transactions in accordance with management’s authorization and recorded them properly to permit the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP.\nManagement evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in the\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In the opinion of management, MetLife, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.\nDeloitte has issued its report on its audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, which is set forth below.\n329\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of MetLife, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the  financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated February 18, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those  financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 18,\n2021\n330"

Deferred Shares are related to awards that have become payable in Shares under any plan, the issuance of which has been deferred.\nThe maximum performance factor for Performance Shares granted in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 was 175%. The number of Performance Shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020 at target (100%) performance factor was 4,101,854.\nMetLife, Inc. may issue Shares pursuant to awards (including Stock Option exercises, if any) under any plan using Shares held in treasury by MetLife, Inc. or by issuing new Shares.\nFor a general description of how the number of Shares paid out on account of Performance Shares and Restricted Stock Units is determined, and the vesting periods applicable to Performance Shares and Restricted Stock Units, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(2)    Column (b) reflects the weighted average exercise price of all Stock Options under any plan that, as of December 31, 2020, had been granted but not forfeited, expired, or exercised. Performance Shares, Restricted Stock Units, and Deferred Shares are not included in determining the weighted average in column (b) because they have no exercise price.\n332\n(3)    Column (c) reflects the following items outstanding as of December 31, 2020:\n______________\n(i)     Consists of Shares that were not covered by awards, including Shares previously covered by awards but recovered due to forfeiture of awards or other reasons and once again available for issuance.\n(ii)     Consists of Shares remaining authorized for issuance under the predecessor plan, the 2005 Director Stock Plan, that were not covered by awards, including Shares previously covered by awards but recovered due to forfeiture of awards or other reasons and once again available.\n(iii)\nIn 2017, MetLife, Inc. completed the separation of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Brighthouse”) through a distribution of shares of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock to the MetLife, Inc. common shareholders (the “Separation”).\nIn light of the Separation, and in order to maintain the Share authorizations under each plan at the levels that shareholders had approved, MetLife, Inc. increased the number of Shares authorized for issuance under the 2015 Stock Plan and 2015 Director Stock Plan as of August 4, 2017, excluding those Shares from the authorizations that had already been issued, by the Adjustment Ratio. MetLife, Inc. also increased the number of Shares covered by outstanding Stock Options, Performance Shares, Restricted Stock Units, and Deferred Shares on that date by the Adjustment Ratio, in order to maintain the intrinsic value of those awards and Deferred Shares, which decreased the number of Shares available for issuance under both plans. The amount in this row is the net increase in the Share authorization under both the 2015 Stock Plan and 2015 Director Stock Plan as a result of these adjustments. For a description of the adjustment to Stock Options, Performance Shares, Restricted Stock Units, and Deferred Shares, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(iv)    Consists of Shares utilized under the 2005 Stock Plan or 2015 Stock Plan that were recovered during each of the indicated calendar years, and therefore once again available for issuance, due to: (i) termination of the award by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, lapse, or otherwise without issuing Shares; (ii) settlement of the award in cash either in lieu of Shares or otherwise; (iii) exchange of the award for awards not involving Shares; (iv) payment of the exercise price of a Stock Option, or the tax withholding requirements with respect to an award, satisfied by tendering Shares to MetLife, Inc. (by either actual delivery or by attestation); (v) satisfaction of tax withholding requirements with respect to an award satisfied by MetLife, Inc. withholding Shares otherwise issuable; and (vi) the payout of Performance Shares at any performance factor less than the maximum performance factor.\n(v)    Consists of Shares covered by awards granted under the 2015 Stock Plan (including Performance Shares assuming future payout at maximum performance factor). Shares covered by awards granted under the 2015 Directors Stock Plan and Shares covered by imputed reinvested dividends credited on Deferred Shares owed to directors, employees or agents, in each case during each of the indicated calendar years.\n333\nEach Share MetLife, Inc. issues in connection with awards granted under the MetLife, Inc. 2005 Stock Plan other than Stock Options or Stock Appreciation Rights (such as Shares payable on account of Performance Shares or Restricted Stock Units under that plan, including any Deferred Shares resulting from such awards) reduces the number of Shares remaining for issuance by 1.179 (“2005 Stock Plan Share Award Ratio”). Each Share MetLife, Inc. issues in connection with a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right granted under the 2005 Stock Plan, or in connection with any award under any other plan for employees and agents (including any Deferred Shares resulting from such awards), reduces the number of Shares remaining for issuance by 1.0. (“Standard Award Ratio”). Shares related to awards that are recovered, and therefore authorized for issuance under the 2015 Stock Plan, are recovered with consideration of the 2005 Stock Plan Share Award Ratio and Standard Award Ratio, as applicable. Each Share MetLife, Inc. issues under the 2005 Director Stock Plan or 2015 Director Stock Plan (including any Deferred Shares resulting from such awards) reduces the number of Shares remaining for issuance under that plan by one. Shares related to awards that are recovered, and therefore authorized for issuance under the 2015 Director Stock Plan are recovered with consideration of this ratio. If MetLife, Inc. was to grant a Share-settled Stock Appreciation Right under the 2015 Stock Plan and the award holder exercised it, only the number of Shares MetLife, Inc. issued, net of the Shares tendered, if any, would be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of Shares MetLife, Inc. may issue under the 2015 Stock Plan.\nAny Shares covered by awards under the 2015 Director Stock Plan that were to be recovered due to (i) termination of the award by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, lapse, or otherwise without issuing Shares; (ii) settlement of the award in cash either in lieu of Shares or otherwise; (iii) exchange of the award for awards not involving Shares; and (iv) payment of the exercise price of a Stock Option, or the tax withholding requirements with respect to an award, satisfied by tendering Shares to MetLife, Inc. (by either actual delivery or by attestation) would be available to be issued under the 2015 Director Stock Plan. In addition, if MetLife, Inc. was to grant a Share-settled Stock Appreciation Right under the 2015 Director Stock Plan, only the number of Shares issued, net of the Shares tendered, if any, would be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of Shares available for issuance under the 2015 Director Stock Plan.\nUnder both the 2015 Stock Plan and the 2015 Director Stock Plan, in the event of a corporate event or transaction (including, but not limited to, a change in the Shares or the capitalization of MetLife) such as a merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, separation, stock dividend, extraordinary dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split up, spin-off, or other distribution of stock or property of MetLife, combination of securities, exchange of securities, dividend in kind, or other like change in capital structure or distribution (other than normal cash dividends) to shareholders of MetLife, or any similar corporate event or transaction, the appropriate committee of the Board of Directors of MetLife, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of participants’ rights under the applicable plan, shall substitute or adjust, as applicable, the number and kind of Shares that may be issued under that plan and shall adjust the number and kind of Shares subject to outstanding awards. Any Shares related to awards under either plan which: (i) terminate by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, or otherwise without the issuance of Shares; (ii) are settled in cash either in lieu of Shares or otherwise; or (iii) are exchanged with the appropriate committee’s permission for awards not involving Shares, are available again for grant under the applicable plan. If the option price of any Stock Option granted under either plan or the tax withholding requirements with respect to any award granted under either plan is satisfied by tendering Shares to MetLife (by either actual delivery or by attestation), or if a Stock Appreciation Right is exercised, only the number of Shares issued, net of the Shares tendered, if any, will be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of Shares available for issuance under that plan. The maximum number of Shares available for issuance under either plan shall not be reduced to reflect any dividends or dividend equivalents that are reinvested into additional Shares or credited as additional Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units.\nFor a description of the kinds of awards that have been or may be made under the 2015 Stock Plan and 2015 Director Stock Plan and awards that remained outstanding under the 2005 Stock Plan, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements."
