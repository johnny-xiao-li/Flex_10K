Our products are sold in approximately 100 countries through a large worldwide network of independent retailers, online retailers, dealers, distributors, installation and repair shops, as well as through original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). We also offer products through our online webshop, www.garmin.com.\nNo single customer’s purchases represented 10% or more of Garmin’s consolidated net sales in the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018. Marketing support is provided geographically from Garmin’s offices around the world.\nCompetition\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, though competitive conditions vary among our diverse target markets and geographies. Garmin believes the principal competitive factors impacting the market for its products are design, functionality, quality and reliability, customer service, brand, price, time-to-market and availability. Garmin believes that it generally competes favorably in each of these areas and as such, is generally a significant competitor in each of our major markets.\nGarmin believes that its principal competitors for fitness products are Apple, Bryton, Elite, Fitbit, Huami, Huawei, Polar, Samsung, Sigma Sports, Suunto, Wahoo Fitness, and Xiaomi. Garmin believes that its principal competitors for outdoor product lines are Casio, Dogtra, Shearwater Research, Globalstar, SportDOG, Suunto, TAG Heuer, Tissot, and Vista Outdoor. For marine products, Garmin believes that its principal competitors are Flir Systems, Furuno, Johnson Outdoors, and Navico. Garmin considers its principal avionics competitors to be Aspen Avionics, Avidyne Corporation, CMC Electronics, Raytheon, Dynon Avionics, ForeFlight, Genesys Aerosystems, Honeywell Aerospace & Defense, Innovative Solutions and Support Inc., L-3 Avionics Systems, Safran SA, Thales, and Universal Avionics Systems Corporation. Garmin believes that its principal competitor for consumer automotive products is TomTom N.V., and Rand McNally. Garmin believes that its principal competitors for auto OEM infotainment solutions are Alpine Electronics, Harman International Industries, Continental, Bosch, the Mitsubishi Group, and Panasonic Corporation.\n9\nResearch and Development\nGarmin’s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between Garmin’s engineering and manufacturing teams. Garmin’s products are created by its engineering and development staff. Garmin’s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with Garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products. Garmin’s development staff includes industrial designers, as well as software engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, and cartographic engineers. Garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in Garmin’s success.\nManufacturing and Operations\nGarmin believes one of its core competencies and strengths is its vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities at its Taiwan facilities in Xizhi, Jhongli and LinKou, its China facility in Yangzhou, its Netherlands facility in Oegstgeest, its Poland facility in Wroclaw, and at its U.S. facilities in Olathe, Kansas and Salem, Oregon. Garmin believes that its ownership and operation of its own manufacturing facilities and distribution networks provides significant capability and flexibility to address the breadth and depth of resources necessary to serve its diverse products and markets.\nSpecifically, Garmin believes that its vertical integration of its manufacturing capabilities provides advantages to product cost, quality, and time to market.\nCost:\nGarmin’s manufacturing resources rapidly and iteratively prototype designs, concepts, products and processes, achieving higher efficiency, resulting in lower cost. Garmin’s vertical integration approach enables leveraging of manufacturing resources across high, mid and low volume products. Sharing of these resources across product lines favorably affects Garmin’s costs to produce its range of products, with lower volume products realizing the economies of scale of higher volume products. The ownership and integration of its resources allows\nGarmin to optimize the design for manufacturing of its products, yielding improved cost.\nQuality:\nGarmin’s automation and advanced production processes provide in-service robustness and consistent reliability standards that enable Garmin to maintain strict process and quality control of the products manufactured, thereby improving the overall quality of our products. Additionally, the immediate feedback throughout the manufacturing processes is provided to the development teams, providing integrated continuous improvement throughout design and supply chain.\nTime to Market:\nGarmin uses multi-disciplinary teams of design engineers, process engineers, and supply chain specialists to develop products, allowing them to quickly move from concept to manufacturing. This integrated ownership provides inherent flexibility to enable faster time to market.\nGarmin’s\ndesign, manufacturing, distribution, and service functions in its U.S., Taiwan, China and U.K. facilities are certified to ISO 9001, an international quality standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization. Garmin’s automotive operations in Taiwan, China, U.K., and Olathe have achieved IATF 16949 certification, a quality standard for automotive suppliers. Garmin’s Olathe and Salem aviation operations have achieved certification to AS9100, the quality standard for the aviation industry.\nGarmin International, Inc., Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and Garmin Corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the ISO 14001 standard, recognizing Garmin’s systems and processes which minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and continually strive to improve its environmental performance.\nMaterials\nAlthough most components essential to Garmin’s\nbusiness are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects Garmin to supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources, including, but not limited to, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM), GPS chipsets and certain LCDs, are subject, at times, to industry-wide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations.\n10\nGarmin and other participants in the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication, automotive, aviation electronics, and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. In addition, Garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication, and consumer electronics industries. New products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source until Garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have\nmatured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements and safety stock for strategically important components.\nSeasonality\nOur net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation. Sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season, and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season. Sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products. Our auto OEM and aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of auto program manufacturing, aircraft certifications, regulatory mandates, and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. In addition, Garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business.\nAs of January 28, 2021, Garmin has been issued over 1,450 patents throughout the world and holds more than 930 trademark registrations. The duration of patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law. We believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate. Garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect Garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies.\nThere is no assurance that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part. It is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity.\nRegulations\nThe telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory environment in which Garmin operates is subject to change. In accordance with the United States’ Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules and regulations, wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the FCC and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold. Garmin’s products sold in Europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the European Commission. A delay in receiving required certifications for new products, or enhancements to Garmin’s products, or losing certification for Garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business. In addition, aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), its European counterpart, the European Aviation Safety Agency, and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft.\n11\nBecause Garmin Corporation, one of the Company’s principal subsidiaries, is located in Taiwan, foreign exchange control laws and regulations of Taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of Taiwan may have an impact on Garmin’s operations. The Taiwan Foreign Exchange Control Statute, and regulations thereunder, provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the Ministry of Finance of Taiwan and by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), also referred to as the CBC. Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions. Consequently, foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters, while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks. Aside from trade-related foreign exchange transactions, Taiwan companies and residents may, without foreign exchange approval, remit outside and into Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $50 million and $5 million respectively, or their equivalent, each calendar year. Currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the CBC. The above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between Taiwan Dollars and U.S. Dollars or other foreign currencies. The CBC typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the CBC for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion. A requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and long-term foreign debt with the CBC.\nEnvironmental Matters\nGarmin’s operations are subject to various environmental laws, including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes. Substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business. Capital expenditures for environmental controls are included in our normal capital budget. Historically, capital expenditures associated with environmental controls have not been material and compliance with environmental laws has not had a material impact on the Company’s competitive position.\nMany of Garmin's products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency. Garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection, recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products. Compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business, but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial.\nGarmin has implemented multiple Environmental Management System (EMS) policies in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 standard for Environmental Health and Safety Management. Garmin’s EMS policies set forth practices, standards, and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at Garmin’s Kansas headquarters facility, Garmin’s European headquarters facility, and Garmin’s Taiwan and China manufacturing facilities.\nGarmin continues to strive to reduce our carbon footprint by increasing our environmental sustainability efforts. Our manufacturing locations have implemented increased recycling processes that keep all obsolete Garmin manufactured material from entering the waste stream. Additionally, our most recently completed facility in Olathe, Kansas has been constructed with energy efficient considerations, including reduced water consumption, LED lighting, and reflective roofing to deflect solar radiation.\nHuman Capital\nSuccessful execution of our strategy is dependent on attracting, developing, and retaining key employees and members of our management team. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to provide opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by generous compensation and benefits, and through programs that build connections between our employees and their communities.\n12\nAs of December 26, 2020, the Company had approximately 16,000 full and part-time employees worldwide, of whom approximately 6,000 were in the Americas region, 7,800 were in APAC, and 2,200 were in EMEA. Garmin’s vertical integration model enables us to provide a variety of opportunities across many different professions including engineering, human resources, information technology, marketing, sales, and operations. The Company’s products are created by its engineering and development staff, which numbered approximately 4,900 people worldwide as of December 26, 2020. Garmin’s manufacturing staff, which numbered approximately 6,100 people worldwide as of December 26, 2020, includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with Garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products.\nGarmin respects the right of all employees to form and join an association to represent their interests as employees, to organize, and to bargain collectively or individually. We also respect any employee’s choice to refrain from joining a union. Except for some of Garmin’s employees in Sweden, none of Garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union and none of Garmin's North American or Taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective, as evidenced by a strong company culture and positive relations between the Company and our employees.\nWe offer a range of robust benefits to our employees that enable us to attract and retain leading talent. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region) include stock awards, retirement plans, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which provides employees an opportunity to acquire company ownership for a discounted price. We also invest significant resources in our talent development programs to provide employees with the training and education they need to help achieve their career goals, build relevant skills, and lead their organizations. Employee Resource Groups provide opportunities for employees to connect, network, and become involved in community engagement initiatives.\nWe support local community engagement initiatives where we have a business presence, and we provide opportunities for employees to give back to those communities. One such initiative is through active engagement in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (“STEM”) community outreach programs. Our strategic aim in these educational programs is to educate and encourage local students to pursue careers in the engineering field, especially those in underrepresented groups, which we believe benefits not only our company but the overall industry."

    "text": "The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Company\nIf we are not successful in the continued development, timely manufacture, and introduction of new products or product categories, demand for our products could decrease to the extent that lost sales and profits, or losses, from declining segments or product categories are not entirely offset.\nWe expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products. This is particularly important to replace sales and profits lost, or losses incurred, in declining segments or product categories. The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. If we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete. We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products. However, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance.\n13\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected. Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense. We may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change. These licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products. We may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge. Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products. The timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success. Any future challenges related to new products, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.\nThe markets for many of our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPublic health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases have had and will likely continue to have significant impacts on our business.\nWidespread public health emergencies or outbreaks of epidemics, pandemics, or contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and will likely continue to have, significant impacts on our business. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve, creating disruption and uncertainty around the world, which has resulted in, and we expect will continue to result in, reduced overall demand for certain of our products and other operational impacts. There are unknown factors, such as the duration and severity of the pandemic, the nature and length of actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals to contain or mitigate its impact, the severity and duration of the economic impact caused by the pandemic, the uncertainty surrounding the efficacy, distribution and uptake of vaccines, along with the effectiveness of our response, that may affect the magnitude of effects to our business operations, results of operations, and its ultimate impact on our financial condition.\nDemand for certain of our products has been, and is expected to continue to be, adversely affected in several ways. Consumers have been and may continue to be less able or less likely to purchase certain of our products due to economic hardships, governmental restrictions affecting them and the retail outlets that sell our products, voluntary behavior changes associated with public health guidance, the prioritization of other goods and services by online retailers that sell our products, restrictions on the ability of online retailers to ship products to certain areas, the cancellation of trade shows and other events that are otherwise important in the marketing and sale of our products, and the potential failure and closure of retail outlets and online retailers that sell our products. Certain of our sales and distribution offices have experienced and may again experience temporary closure due to governmental restrictions. Additional or prolonged closures of certain sales and distribution offices could affect our ability to market and distribute products to meet customer demand. The adverse impacts of the pandemic have created economic stress in the global marketplace, high levels of unemployment, loss of income and/or wealth for some individuals, and general economic uncertainty. These conditions have affected and are expected to continue to affect the willingness or ability of customers to purchase certain of our products or those of original equipment manufacturers in which our products are installed.\nOur supply chain may also be adversely impacted by COVID-19. We may be unable to procure, or experience delays in procuring, certain components from our suppliers, and the cost of procuring components could increase. Reduced demand for certain of our products has resulted in, and may continue to result in, reduced utilization of certain of our manufacturing facilities and higher per-unit costs for certain products. Certain of our manufacturing facilities may also experience inopportune temporary closures or reduced hours, which could adversely affect the costs incurred to produce our products and our ability to meet demand.\n14\nCOVID-19 has had and will continue to have several other operational impacts on our business, which will or may include employees working remotely, temporarily ceasing operations in some offices due to government restrictions, business travel restrictions, and the cancellation of events that are otherwise important in the development\n, marketing and sale\nof our products. These changes in our business operations may result in reduced efficiency and lower productivity. We have incurred and are expected to continue to incur increased costs as we provide additional benefits to assist our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide a safe and healthy workplace for employees who continue to work in our facilities. Similar operational and financial hardships on our business partners may result in aged or uncollectable receivables, and the reduced demand for certain of our products could result in obsolescence of certain inventory. If the economy experiences a sustained downturn of significant proportion that impacts portions of our business, we may also need to incur the costs and organizational impacts of personnel restructuring.\nAdditional risks and impacts associated with COVID-19 including gross margin fluctuation, foreign currency fluctuations, successful continued product development, impacts to our key personnel, and dependencies on third party suppliers, may be heightened as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. There are further unknown risks and impacts due to the uncertainty and rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic including, but not limited to, uncertainty around the evolution of the pandemic, the unprecedented imposition of preventative measures by governments that impact the economy and normal operations of a business and the timing and manner of relaxation of those measures. Potential future health emergencies may present risks and impacts similar to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to manage these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially impacted.\nMaturation or contraction of the market for wearable devices or categories of these devices could adversely affect our revenue and profits.\nWe have experienced growth in sales and profits in our outdoor and fitness segments, which in recent years have benefited from increased sales of wearable devices. If the overall wearable device market declines, or categories of devices within the wearable device market decline significantly, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on third party suppliers and licensors, some of which are sole source, for content, technology, and components used in our products. Our production and business would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise.\nWe are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products. Some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors. The cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products. Some components we use are from sole source suppliers. Certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers. Alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components.\nWe have and may continue to experience shortages of certain components. In addition, a shortage in supply of components may result in an increase of the costs of available components. If suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis or if we are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed.\nWe are committed to make significant investments in auto OEM for the foreseeable future, which could negatively impact total Company profits and shareholder value if we fail to become profitable.\nWe have been awarded several tier-one and tier-two auto OEM supplier contracts. To fulfill the associated program commitments, we are investing significantly in facilities, research and development, and other operating expenses and we will continue to do so in the coming years. Gross margins associated with these auto OEM programs are lower than the gross margins realized by the Company as a whole in recent periods. If we are not successful in winning additional contract awards or substantially leveraging our investments, periods of lower operating income or operating losses in the auto OEM segment could continue to negatively impact total Company profits and may negatively impact shareholder value if we fail to become profitable.\n15\nWe rely on information technology systems for our business operations. Failures or disruptions, including security breaches or cyber attacks, to our information technology systems may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and result of operations.\nOur information technology systems allow for our daily business operations to operate efficiently and effectively. These systems assist in our business processes, including, but not limited to, communications, financial management, supply chain management, manufacturing, order processing, shipping and billing, and providing services and support to our customers. Additionally, we electronically maintain sensitive data, including our intellectual property and confidential and proprietary information and that of our business partners. We also electronically maintain personal information of our users and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations. A disruption to any of these processes can adversely affect our business and results of operations. Furthermore, a breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our intellectual property or confidential and proprietary information or that of our business partners, as well as our users’ or employees' personal information.\nWe have technology and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties have also attempted, and may in the future attempt, to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees. Accordingly, we have been and may in the future be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. It is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information.\nActual or anticipated attacks and risks have caused and are expected to continue to cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to conduct additional employee training, and to engage third party security experts and consultants.\nIf we fail to reasonably maintain the security of our intellectual property or confidential and proprietary information or that of our business partners, or if we fail to reasonably maintain the security of the personal information of our users or employees, we may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected. In addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of internal operations and loss of functionality of critical systems and online services, and may subject us to private litigation, government investigations, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, and cause us to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or remediation costs. Although we maintain cyber insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.\nThe Company was the victim of a cyber attack that encrypted some of our systems on July 23, 2020. As a result, many of our online services were interrupted including website functions, customer support, customer facing applications, and company communications. We immediately began to assess the nature of the attack and started remediation. Based on our due diligence and independent forensic analysis, we have no indication that any customer data was accessed, lost or stolen. Additionally, the functionality of Garmin products was not affected, other than the ability to access online services. The impact of this outage to our operations and financial results was not material, and we do not expect it to have material impacts on future periods. However, we may still suffer negative consequences, including certain of those described in the paragraphs above, beyond our current expectations\n.\nOur annual and quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation.\nThe operation of our subsidiaries in global markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to certain other currencies. The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. We have not historically used financial instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risks.\n16\nThe currencies that typically create a majority of our exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, British Pound Sterling, Australian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, and Japanese Yen.\nThe Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the Euro is the functional currency of several subsidiaries, and the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds. Other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency. Due to the relative size of entities with other functional currencies, fluctuations of other currencies are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nWe translate income and expense activity at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date, and all assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense activity in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar can be impacted by exchange rate variations over time.\nThe majority of our consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by exchange rate impacts on the significant cash, receivables, and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity. Such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share. However, because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on our operating performance before the impact of foreign currency gains and losses.\nChanges in applicable tax laws or resolutions of tax disputes could result in adverse tax consequences to the Company.\nOur tax positions could be adversely impacted by changes to tax laws, tax treaties, or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority in which we file income tax returns, particularly in the US, Switzerland, Taiwan, and UK. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals.\nGlobal taxing standards continue to evolve as a result of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) recommendations aimed at preventing perceived base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) by multinational corporations. While these recommendations do not change tax law, the countries where we operate may implement legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse effects to our income tax provision and financial statements. Partially to respond to recent and continuing changes to global tax standards, we initiated an intercompany transaction which migrates ownership of certain consumer products intellectual property from Switzerland to the United States, which is the primary location of research, development and executive management. Due to the subjectivity inherent in transfer pricing associated with this intercompany transaction, we are pursuing an advanced pricing agreement with relevant jurisdictions to provide certainty regarding the pricing. However, we are unable to predict the outcome of the final advanced pricing agreement and related negotiations, which could materially and/or adversely impact our income tax provision, net income or cash flows for periods during negotiation and upon finalization.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain, most notably in the area of transfer pricing. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nChanges to trade regulations, including trade restrictions, sanctions, or tariffs, could significantly harm our results of operations.\nWe manufacture goods in the People’s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC, and import certain materials from the PRC that are used to manufacture goods in the United States. The imposition of additional governmental controls or regulations that create new or enhanced restrictions on free trade, trade sanctions, or tariffs, particularly those applicable to materials or goods from the PRC, could have a substantial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n17\nEconomic, regulatory, and political conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and profits.\nOur revenue and profits depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. We have operations outside the United States that make up a significant portion of our total revenue, which can present challenges depending on economic and geopolitical conditions on both a global and regional scale. Economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue in the past, and could in the future result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and OEM customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in Taiwan.\nOur principal manufacturing facilities, where we manufacture most of our consumer products, are located in Taiwan. Relations between Taiwan and the PRC and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of Taiwan in the future, could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares.\nThe PRC asserts sovereignty over all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands, and all of mainland China. The PRC government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government. Although significant economic and cultural relations exist between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by Taiwan. The United States' relations with Taiwan are governed by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which signifies when the U.S. switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the PRC, referred to as the \"one-China\" policy. Deviations from the \"one-China\" policy could lead to adverse changes in China-U.S. and China-Taiwan relations and could adversely affect our operations in Taiwan in the future.\nIf we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories.\nWe have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand. However, the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast. We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio, competition in the market for our products intensifies and the markets for some of our products mature. Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations:\n18\nThe effects of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (“Brexit”), including trade agreements, are not yet known and the uncertainty creates challenges and risks which could have a material effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe United Kingdom (UK) formally left the European Union (EU) on January 31, 2020, and a transition period through December 31, 2020 was established to allow the UK and EU to negotiate the terms of the UK’s withdrawal. As a result, the UK is no longer part of the European Single Market and European Union Customs Union effective January 1, 2021. The UK and EU signed the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) in December 2020, which has been applied provisionally since January 1, 2021 until it is ratified by all parties to the agreement. Under the TCA, there is no longer the free movement of goods or people between the UK and the EU, which has resulted and could continue to result in certain delays in the shipment of these goods. The long-term risks of Brexit include economic recessions in the UK or other European markets and currency instability for both the British Pound Sterling and the Euro.\nWe have operations in the UK, including offices and a distribution facility, and several EU member states. Brexit therefore has impacted and will continue to impact our operations. While these impacts have not yet been material to our business operations, results of operations, and financial condition, risks such as slow or inefficient border clearance, prolonged economic recession, and currency fluctuations could have material adverse effects in the future.\nOur intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon others’ rights or are infringed upon by others.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks. However, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks. In addition, effective copyright, patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain countries. Moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons. Thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.\nThe value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many patent filings. Third parties may claim that we or our customers (some of whom are indemnified by us) are infringing their intellectual property rights. For example, individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers. The number of these claims has increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. From time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights and we have been, and currently are, a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement. Litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming. We may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. Such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products.\nWe may become subject to significant product liability costs.\nIf our products malfunction or contain errors or defects, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages. We maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products. However, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, insurance coverage may not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins. If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n19\nWe have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\nWe are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict. Management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability, or we may suffer unforeseen liabilities, which could then impact the results of a financial period. A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable and could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nContinued declines in consumer auto revenue could negatively impact the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the reporting unit.\nWe experienced substantial growth through 2008 in our auto segment as PNDs became mass-market consumer electronics in both Europe and North America. The consumer auto market has been declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred. Navigation technologies have been incorporated into and become more prevalent in competing devices such as mobile handsets, tablets, and new automobiles through factory-installed systems. The acceptance by consumers of these alternative solutions has negatively impacted sales and profits in the consumer auto segment. There is no assurance that the decline in sales will end, and thus no assurance that we can continue to generate profits from the consumer auto segment, which could put some or all of the goodwill associated with the consumer auto reporting unit at further risk of impairment.\nOur products may contain undetected security vulnerabilities, which could result in damage to our reputation, lost revenue, diverted development resources and increased warranty claims, and litigation.\nUndiscovered vulnerabilities in our products could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could attack our products. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases, or use competing products.\nOur business is subject to a variety of United States and international laws, regulations and other legal obligations regarding data protection.\nWe collect, store, process, and use personal information and other user data. Our users’ personal information may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, payment account information, height, weight, age, gender, heart rates, sleeping patterns, GPS-based location, and activity patterns.\nRegulatory authorities and legislative bodies around the world, including in the United States, have enacted or are considering enacting a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties, governmental investigations and regulatory proceedings, litigation, harm to our brand, and a decrease in the use of our products and services. Many of these laws provide for significant penalties. Under the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, for example, potential penalties can be as high as 4% of a company’s total global revenue.\nGross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode.\nGross margins in some of our segments are volatile and could decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions. In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes. In particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life. To offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future. To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n20\nChanges in our United States federal income tax classification, or that of our subsidiaries, could result in adverse tax consequences to our 10% or greater U.S. shareholders.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Act”) signed on December 22, 2017 may have changed the consequences to U.S. shareholders that own, or are considered to own, as a result of the attribution rules, ten percent or more of the voting power or value of the stock of a non-U.S. corporation (a 10% U.S. shareholder) under the U.S. federal income tax law applicable to owners of U.S. controlled foreign corporations (“CFCs”).\nThe 2017 Act repealed Internal Revenue Code Section 958(b)(4), which, unless clarified in future regulations or other guidance, may result in classification of certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries as CFCs with respect to any single 10% U.S. shareholder. This may be the result without regard to whether 10% U.S. shareholders together own, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the Company as was the case under prior rules.\nAdditional tax consequences to 10% U.S. shareholders of a CFC may result from other provisions of the 2017 Act. For example, the 2017 Act added Section 951A which requires a 10% U.S. shareholder of a CFC to include in income its pro-rata share of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of the CFC. The 2017 Act also eliminated the requirement in Section 951(a) necessitating that a foreign corporation be considered a CFC for an uninterrupted period of at least 30 days in order for a 10% U.S. shareholder to have a current income inclusion.\nFrom time to time, the Company may elect to employ antidilutive measures such as a stock buyback program. These measures could inadvertently create additional 10% U.S. shareholders and thus trigger adverse tax consequences for those shareholders as described above. We urge shareholders to consult their individual tax advisers for advice regarding the 2017 Act revisions to the U.S. federal income tax law applicable to owners of CFCs given the current uncertainty regarding their scope of applicability.\nSome of our products are subject to governmental regulation or certification. Failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis, either due to government shutdown or other delays in the certification process, could harm our business.\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type-certificated aircraft. To the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. An inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation OEM products, our customers’ ability to sell airplanes. Delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted and may in the future result in our being required to pay compensation to our customers. Additionally, failure of the United States Congress to appropriate funds for FAA operations that results in a shutdown of FAA operations or furloughing of FAA employees, due to partial or complete government shutdowns or otherwise, could result in delays in the required FAA certification of our avionics products and in the production, sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products. Therefore, such inabilities or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, we cannot assure that our certified products will not be decertified. Any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn addition, in accordance with FCC rules and regulations, wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the FCC in the United States and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold. Garmin’s products sold in Europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the European Commission. A delay in receiving required certifications for new products, or enhancements to Garmin’s products, or losing certification for Garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business.\n21\nOur business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel.\nOur future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel. We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers. Swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers, which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions. We do not have key person life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance. The loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business. Recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult. For example, in recent years there has been a global shortage of qualified engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel. If we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business.\nOur quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality.\nOur operating results are difficult to predict. Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. If such operating results decline, the price of our stock could decline. As we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our research and development costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales in some periods. If revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs, our operating results would be negatively affected.\nHistorically, our revenues have been lower in the first quarter of each fiscal year as many of our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter. Sales of certain of our auto, fitness, marine, and outdoor products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season. Sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season.\nWe rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business.\nBecause we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products. In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories. If dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted.\nMany of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. If our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. In the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors. If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer.\nWe may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, evaluate, complete, and integrate such transactions.\nWe continually evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all.\n22\nAny past or future acquisition could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees, operations, and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities. Integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams. Due diligence performed prior to closing acquisitions may not uncover certain risks or liabilities that could materially impact our business and financial results. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us. We may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the GDPR and other corporate governance and regulatory matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we may make in the future. If we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed.\nMany of our products rely on the Global Positioning System and other Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS).\nThe Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense. The Department of Defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals. These satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage. GPS satellites have a limited lifespan and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate. While many of the original satellites deployed by the U.S. have been in operation for more than 20 years, the U.S. Space Force and Missile Systems Center continue to launch new satellites to replace retired and aged satellites.\nDespite ongoing efforts to repair, maintain and replace non-operational satellites, if a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites. A reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of GPS and the growth of current and additional market opportunities. Furthermore, as GPS satellites and ground control segments are being modernized, software updates can cause problems. We depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of GPS updates.\nGPS is operated by the U.S. Government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of GPS; however, if the policy were to change, and commercial access to GPS was no longer supported by the U.S. Government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nSome of our products also use signals from Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) that augment GPS, such as the U.S. Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), Japanese MTSAT-based Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), and European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS). Any curtailment of SBAS operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets.\nSome of our products also use satellite signals from Russia’s GLONASS, Japan’s MSAS, EGNOS’ aviation SoL service, the European Union Galileo system, and the Chinese BDS. National or European authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets, including our competitors, which could harm our competitive position. Use of non-US GNSS signals may also be subject to FCC waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations. If we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems, or obtain timely and equal access to service signals, it could result in lost revenue.\nOur business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability, war or terrorism.\nActs of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the GPS signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in GPS or interruptions of the system. To the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\n23\nA shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business. The shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors.\nAny reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of Global Positioning System signals. This interference could harm our business.\nOur Global Positioning System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government’s GPS satellites. GPS operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services. International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations. These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference. Each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used. In the United States, the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations.\nAny ITU or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers.\nNatural disasters, catastrophic events, or climate change could affect our financial results.\nNatural disasters and extreme weather events, such as tsunamis, typhoons, floods, wildfires, or earthquakes, could occur in a region where we have a manufacturing or warehousing facility which would cause disruptions in our business operations or loss of inventory. Global climate change could also result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. For descriptions and locations of our principal properties, see Item 2, “Properties”. These events could also have an impact on our suppliers and affect our supply chain. If our backup and recovery plans are not sufficient to minimize business disruption and if our insurance is not sufficient to recover the costs associated with these types of events, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nClimate change can also pose a risk to our business due to evolving regulatory and legislative measures surrounding climate change. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulates greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the Clean Air Act. U.S. Congress, in addition to other regulatory authorities and legislative bodies around the world, could pass further legislation to mandate greenhouse gas emission reduction, implement cap-and-trade programs, or promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. Such measures could influence mobility and transportation trends, which could decrease the demand for certain of our products.\nIf climate change has impacts on natural disasters or the regulatory environment as discussed above, it could result in a change in demand for certain products in markets that we serve, including auto, aviation, and marine. If we fail to adjust our product and service offerings to respond to new opportunities driven by changes in regulation and/or consumer preferences, it could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nBecause it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n24\nRisks Relating to Our Shares\nThe volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares.\nThe market price of our shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. During 2020, the closing price of our shares ranged from a low of $63.63 to a high of $122.85. A variety of factors could cause the price of our shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:\nIn addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nOur officers and directors exert substantial influence over us.\nAs of January 26, 2021, members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers, together with their respective immediate family members and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 22% of our outstanding shares. Accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals. This level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of Garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares.\nThe rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law.\nThe rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law and Garmin Ltd.’s articles of association. The rights of shareholders under Swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. For example, Swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders’ meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders’ meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders’ meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities. Swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions. Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. For example, Swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders. These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.\n25\nWe have limited capital reserves from which to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders to Switzerland withholding tax.\nAs of December 26, 2020, we had CHF 5,214 million of unappropriated capital contribution reserves available from which the Company may make dividend payments or utilize to repurchase shares for which no withholding tax applies. At the time this reserve balance has been returned to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases, a Swiss federal withholding tax of 35% will generally be applicable to any dividends paid to shareholders. The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss federal Tax Administration. A holder that qualifies for benefits under a double tax treaty may be able to recover partial withholding tax. For example, a U.S holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds).\nAfter we have exhausted our remaining capital contribution reserves by appropriating them for dividends or share repurchases, any dividends paid by the Company will generally be subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax at 35%.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a dividend out of capital contribution reserves, or that Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in Swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions. If we are unable to pay a dividend out of capital contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding taxes.\nUnder current Swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price. However, the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the Swiss withholding tax. Therefore, repurchase of our own shares further limits the amount of capital reserves available for distributions to shareholders free of Swiss withholding taxes. No partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares to the extent sufficient capital reserves are available. However, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years and there is not sufficient capital contribution reserves, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six-year period.\nThere is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in Switzerland and Taiwan.\nWe are a Swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan. As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon us. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland or Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in Switzerland or Taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.\nWe have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares.\nUnder Swiss law we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only repurchase and hold our own shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) are available. The aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. We may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation. Any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors."

    "text": "Garmin and its subsidiaries own a majority of their principal properties and lease certain other properties. Depending on location, the properties could be used for manufacturing, warehousing, research and development, office space, or a combination of activities. Garmin’s principal properties are described below:\nGarmin International, Inc. owns and occupies facilities of approximately 1,990,000 square feet on approximately 107 acres at 1200 East 151st Street, Olathe, Kansas, U.S. where the majority of product design and development work is conducted, the majority of aviation panel-mount products are manufactured, and products are warehoused, distributed, and supported for North, Central and South America.

This discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, the other related information including, but not limited to, the audited Consolidated Financial Statements (including the notes thereto), the description of our business, all as set forth in this Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors discussed above in Item 1A.\nThis section provides discussion and a year-to-year comparison for the fiscal years ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019. Discussion regarding our results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 and a year-to-year comparison between the fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 can be found in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019.\nAs previously noted, the discussion set forth below, as well as other portions of this Form 10-K, contain statements concerning potential future events. Readers can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of such verbs as “expects,” “anticipates,” “believes” or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs. If any of our assumptions on which the statements are based prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise, our actual results could materially differ from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements. The differences could be caused by a number of factors or combination of factors including, but not limited to, those discussed above in Item 1A. Readers are strongly encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating any such forward-looking statement. Except as may be required by law, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K.\nGarmin’s fiscal year is a 52-53 week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year. Fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 contained 52 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to the Company’s fiscal year and fiscal periods. Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this document to \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" and similar terms refer to Garmin Ltd. and its subsidiaries.\nUnless otherwise indicated, dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands, except per share data.\nOverview\nWe are a leading worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS, technology. Garmin is organized in the six operating segments of auto OEM, aviation, consumer auto, fitness, marine, and outdoor. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who has been identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), allocates resources and assesses performance of each operating segment individually. The aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor operating segments represent reportable segments. The auto OEM and consumer auto operating segments, which serve the auto market, do not meet the quantitative thresholds to separately qualify as reportable segments, and they are therefore reported together in an “all other” category captioned as auto. Auto, aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor are collectively referred to as our reported segments.\nThe operating segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors, our own webshop, as well as through various auto, aviation, and marine OEMs. Each of the operating segments is managed separately. The consumer auto operating segment was previously referred to as our auto PND operating segment. We have revised the name of this operating segment to reflect the evolution of the product lines and focus of that part of our business. The name change did not impact the composition or operating results of the segment.\nSince our first products were delivered in 1991, we have generated positive income from consolidated operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits.\n34\nImpacts of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created disruption and uncertainty in the global economy and has affected our business, suppliers, and customers. Our operating segments were not all impacted equally, as COVID-19 had an unfavorable impact on net sales and profitability of the auto and aviation segments during fiscal year 2020. However, the diversity of our business and product offerings helped mitigate the impacts to our consolidated net sales and operating income.\nWith pre-existing fundamentals such as trade credit insurance, direct online sales through our webshops, direct fulfillment arrangements with certain retailers, our strong cash and marketable securities position, market and product diversity, a vertically integrated business model, and ample inventory on hand, we were well-positioned to mitigate the initial impacts of COVID-19. While COVID-19 continues to evolve into a complicated and prolonged global pandemic, we have implemented further mitigation measures, such as initiating additional direct fulfillment arrangements with retailers, mitigating single source supplier dependencies, enhancing cleaning and sanitation within our facilities to maintain a healthy and safe environment for essential on-site functions, boosting functionality and security of technology for employees who are working from home, and fostering the safe reintegration of our on-site workforce. These mitigation efforts complement our top priorities of ensuring the health and safety of our employees and continuing to serve our customers. Additional benefits have been provided to many of our employees, including increased flexible work arrangements, remote work access, and flexible paid leave policies. We have also focused on mitigating impacts to operating income and liquidity by monitoring our expense structure and balance sheet, reducing and prioritizing certain discretionary operating expenses and capital expenditures, and slowing the number of new employees hired.\nSustained adverse impacts to us, our suppliers or our customers may affect the future valuation of certain assets and therefore may increase the likelihood of an impairment charge, write-off, write-down, reserve, or accelerated expense associated with such assets, including marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses, property and equipment, tax assets, goodwill, indefinite and finite-lived intangible assets, capitalized preproduction design and development costs, and other assets.\nAlthough we believe we have taken appropriate actions to help mitigate risks associated with COVID-19 as described above, the duration and magnitude of COVID-19 impacts to our business operations and financial results may be affected by a number of factors including uncertainty regarding the evolution of the pandemic, the imposition or relaxation of government restrictions on business and social gathering activities, voluntary behavior changes associated with public health guidance, the efficacy, distribution and uptake of vaccines, and those presented above in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The presentation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n35\nGoodwill\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units in proportion to the expected benefit from each business combination. Each of the Company’s operating segments (auto OEM, aviation, consumer auto, fitness, marine, and outdoor) represents a distinct reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the operating performance indicators, competition, or expectations about future market or economic conditions.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant assumptions, including discount rate, projected future revenues, projected future operating margins, and terminal growth rates. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\nUnrecognized Income Tax Benefits\nWe recognize liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions, including those related to transfer pricing, based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We recognize the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be not required or it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nAssessing uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment, including the evaluation of unique facts and circumstances and the interpretation of laws and regulations, especially the assessment of pricing analyses that may produce various ranges of outcomes. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nOther\nFor further information on the Company’s critical accounting policies, refer to the discussion in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as indicated in the table below:\n36\nAccounting Terms and Characteristics\nNet Sales\nOur net sales are primarily generated through sales to our retail partners, dealer and distributor network, our own webshop, and to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Refer to the Revenue Recognition discussion in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive from our retail, dealer, and distributor customers. Certain arrangements with OEM customers are entered into at the beginning of an aircraft or vehicle life cycle with the intent to fulfill customer purchasing requirements for the entire production life, although there are generally no firm volume commitments, and sales are therefore generated on an order-by-order basis. As a result, we do not believe backlog information is material to the understanding of our business.\nNet sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation. Typically, sales of our consumer products are highest in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season, and in the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season. Our auto OEM and aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation but are more influenced by the timing of auto program manufacturing, aircraft certifications, regulatory mandates, and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.\nCost of Sales/Gross Profit\nRaw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold. Our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products in-house has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components. We believe that our flexible production model allows our factories to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing. In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products. Our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan and China than in Olathe and Salem.\nSales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit. Our gross profit is dependent on segment mix, and to a lesser extent, product mix within each segment.\nAdvertising Expense\nOur advertising expenses consist primarily of costs for media advertising, cooperative advertising with our retail partners, point of sale displays, and sponsorships.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of:\n37\nResearch and Development\nThe majority of our research and development costs represent engineering personnel costs, costs of test equipment and components used in product and prototype development, and outside product development costs.\nWe are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new auto OEM programs and new markets for active lifestyle products.\nIncome Taxes\nWe have experienced a relatively low effective income tax rate due to the proportion of our income generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown (the table may not foot due to rounding):\nThe table below sets forth our results of operations through operating income for each of our five reported segments and supplemental information for the consumer auto and auto OEM operating segments that management believes is useful. The Company’s CODM uses operating income as the measure of profit or loss, combined with other measures, to assess segment performance and allocate resources. Operating income represents net sales less costs of goods sold and operating expenses. Net sales are directly attributed to each segment. Most costs of goods sold and the majority of operating expenses are also directly attributed to each segment, while certain other costs of goods sold and operating expenses are allocated to the segments in a manner appropriate to the specific facts and circumstances of the expenses being allocated. For each line item in the table below, the total of the reported segments’ amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in Item 6.\nAs indicated in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the methodology used to allocate certain selling, general, and administrative expenses was refined at the beginning of the 2019 fiscal year. The amounts presented below for the 52-weeks ended December 29, 2018 are presented here as they were originally reported. For comparative purposes, we estimate operating income for the 52-weeks ended December 29, 2018 would have been approximately $18 million less for aviation, approximately $11 million more for marine, approximately $7 million more for outdoor, and not significantly different for auto and fitness.\n38\nNet Sales\n39\nNet sales increased 11% in 2020 when compared to the year-ago period. All operating segments had an increase in revenue except for aviation and consumer auto. Fitness revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in 2020 at 31% compared to 28% in 2019.\nTotal unit sales decreased 1.3% to 15.4 million units in 2020 from 15.6 million units in 2019.\nFitness, outdoor, marine, and auto OEM revenues increased 26%, 23%, 29%, and 1%, respectively, when compared to the year-ago period. The fitness revenue increase was primarily driven by strong demand for advanced wearables and cycling products. The outdoor revenue increase was driven by sales growth across multiple product categories, primarily led by adventure watches. Marine revenue increases were driven by sales growth across all product categories, led primarily by chartplotters and SONAR products. The auto OEM revenue increase was driven by sales growth in new auto OEM programs. Aviation revenue decreased 15% from the year-ago period, due to fewer shipments to OEM customers and reduced contributions from ADS-B products. Consumer auto revenue decreased 25% from the year-ago period, primarily due to the ongoing personal navigation device market contraction.\nGross Profit\nGross profit dollars in fiscal year 2020 increased 11%, primarily due to the increase in net sales compared to the year-ago period. Consolidated gross margin was relatively flat compared to fiscal year 2019. The fitness and consumer auto gross margin increases of 210 basis points and 365 basis points, respectively, were primarily attributable to product mix. Gross margin remained relatively flat within the outdoor segment. The marine and aviation gross margin decreases of 110 basis points and 115 basis points, respectively, were primarily attributable to product mix. The auto OEM gross margin decrease of 1,010 basis points was primarily attributable to product mix associated with growth in new auto OEM programs. This product mix and associated gross margin trend is generally expected to continue into 2021 and beyond.\nAdvertising Expenses\n40\nAdvertising expense decreased 8% in absolute dollars and decreased slightly as a percent of revenue in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019. The overall decrease in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to decreased media advertising in fitness and outdoor and decreased cooperative advertising in consumer auto. These decreases were partially offset by increased cooperative advertising expense in fitness, outdoor, and marine. Advertising expenses in all operating segments decreased slightly as a percent of revenue compared to the prior year.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased 10% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue when compared to the prior year. The absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to information technology costs and personnel related expenses.\nAs noted above and in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company refined its methodology to allocate certain selling, general and administrative expenses at the beginning of the 2019 fiscal year. The prior year amounts are presented here as originally reported. For comparative purposes, we estimate selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2018 would have been approximately $18 million more for aviation, approximately $11 million less for marine, approximately $7 million less for outdoor, and not significantly different for fitness and auto.\nResearch and Development Expense\n41\nResearch and development expense increased 17% in absolute dollars when compared to the year-ago period and increased slightly as a percent of revenue. The absolute dollar increase was primarily due to engineering personnel costs across all of our operating segments and other expenses related to auto OEM programs. The auto OEM increase in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue was primarily attributable to higher engineering personnel costs and other expenses related to investments in auto OEM programs and a lower proportion of such costs being contractually reimbursable in fiscal year 2020. This trend of increasing auto OEM research and development expense is expected to continue in 2021 as we expect higher total costs and the majority of costs will not be contractually reimbursable.\nOperating Income\nTotal operating income increased 11% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue when compared to fiscal year 2019. The growth in total operating income on an absolute dollar basis was the result of revenue growth as discussed above. Operating income, in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue, decreased in aviation primarily due to a decline in sales compared to the year-ago period. Auto OEM experienced an operating loss in fiscal year 2020, and we expect this trend of an operating loss to continue in 2021, primarily due to a lower gross margin and increased expense associated with certain programs, as described above.\nOther Income (Expense)\nThe average returns on cash and investments, including interest and capital gain/loss returns during the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, were 1.4% and 2.0%, respectively. Interest income decreased primarily due to lower yields on fixed-income securities.\n42\nForeign currency gains and losses for the Company are typically driven by movements of a number of currencies in relation to the U.S. Dollar. The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the Euro is the functional currency of several subsidiaries, and the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds. Other notable currency exposures include the Australian Dollar, and Chinese Yuan. The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity.\nThe $2.8 million currency gain recognized in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Euro, Australian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, and British Pound Sterling, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Taiwan Dollar. During fiscal 2020, the U.S. Dollar weakened 9.2% against the Euro, 9.4% against the Australian Dollar, 7.2% against the Chinese Yuan, and 3.6% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $21.1 million, $6.5 million, $2.9 million, and $2.6 million, respectively, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 7.1% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $32.2 million. The remaining net currency gain of $1.9 million is related to the timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies, each of which was individually immaterial.\nThe $16.8 million currency loss recognized in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Euro and weakening against the Taiwan Dollar, offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the British Pound Sterling. During fiscal 2019, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 2.3% against the Euro and weakened 1.5% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in losses of $9.3 million and $7.1 million, respectively, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.9% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in a gain of $2.8 million. The remaining net currency loss of $3.2 million is related to the timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies, each of which was individually immaterial.\nIncome Tax Provision\nIncome tax expense for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020 was $111.1 million compared to income tax expense of $34.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019, representing a net increase of $76.4 million. Contributing to the year-over-year increase in income tax expense in fiscal year 2020 was an income tax benefit of $118.0 million recognized in fiscal year 2019 associated with the revaluation and step-up of certain Switzerland tax assets as a result of the October 2019 enactment of Switzerland federal and Schaffhausen cantonal tax reform and related transitional measures. A revaluation of these assets performed in the fourth quarter of 2020 resulted in an $11.0 million income tax expense in fiscal year 2020. In connection with these transitional measures included in Switzerland tax reform, a reduced income tax rate will be utilized on certain Switzerland taxable income for up to five years. The Company also recognized a $14.3 million income tax benefit in fiscal 2020 due to the release of uncertain tax position reserves associated with a 2014 intercompany restructuring.\nExcluding the aforementioned $11.0 million income tax expense and $14.3 million income tax benefit in fiscal 2020, and the $118.0 million tax benefit in fiscal 2019, income tax expense for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was $114.4 million and $152.7 million, respectively. In this comparison, income tax expense for fiscal year 2020 was lower primarily due to a transaction initiated by the Company in February 2020 between wholly-owned subsidiaries to migrate ownership of certain intellectual property from Switzerland to the United States, the primary location of research, development, and executive management. The migration, which includes a multi-year intercompany license of intellectual property, has resulted in a favorable shift of income mix by jurisdiction and a reduction in expense related to uncertain tax positions. During the term of the license agreement, this transaction is expected to continue to result in a lower effective income tax rate as compared to the fiscal year 2019 effective income tax rate, excluding the $118.0 million income tax benefit in 2019 described above. The Company is pursuing an Advance Pricing Agreement between relevant jurisdictions related to this transaction. At the end of the license agreement, a higher percentage of income will be recognized in the United States.\nNet Income\nAs a result of the various factors noted above net income increased 4% to $992.3 million from $952.5 million in the prior year.\n43\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 26, 2020, we had approximately $3.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We primarily use cash flow from operations, and expect that future cash requirements may be used, to fund our capital expenditures, support our working capital requirements, pay dividends, and fund strategic acquisitions. We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our short- and long-term projected working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other cash requirements.\nIt is management’s goal to invest the on-hand cash in accordance with the investment policy, which has been approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. The investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk. Garmin’s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were approximately 1.4%, 2.0% and 1.9%, respectively. The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral, and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors. See Note 8 for additional information regarding marketable securities.\nOperating Activities\nThe $436.7 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was due to a decrease in cash used in working capital of $294.3 million (which included an increase of $14.5 million in net receipts of accounts receivable, a decrease of $198.9 million in cash paid for inventory, a decrease of $13.6 million net cash used for income taxes, and a decrease of $92.0 million net cash used in other activities primarily driven by prior year payments associated with an amendment to a license agreement, partially offset by an increase of $24.7 million net cash used in accounts payable). Additional changes were due to the year-over-year increase in net income of $39.8 million and an increase in other non-cash adjustments to net income of $102.6 million primarily driven by a prior year income tax benefit of $118.0 million associated with the revaluation and step-up of certain Switzerland tax assets.\nInvesting Activities\nThe $190.2 million decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in cash payments for acquisitions of $151.6 million, an increase in net redemptions of marketable securities of $104.2 million, and partially offset by increased net purchases of property and equipment of $65.9 million.\nFinancing Activities\nThe $45.7 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to an increase in dividend payments of $33.4 million.\nOur declared dividend has increased from $0.53 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2018 to $0.57 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2019, and to $0.61 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2020.\n44\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nAs of December 26, 2020, operating leases comprise the substance of the Company’s commercial commitments with long-term scheduled payments, as summarized below:\nThe Company is party to certain other commitments, which include purchases of raw materials, capital expenditures, advertising, and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business. The aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of December 26, 2020 was approximately $880.0 million. We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are generally based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled within short periods of time.\nWe may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $85.0 million as of December 26, 2020, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Income Taxes and Note 6 – Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements."

    "text": "Market Sensitivity\nWe have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials. Product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions. Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs.\nInflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nThe operation of Garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar. The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. The Company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks.\n45\nThe currencies that create a majority of the Company’s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, British Pound Sterling, Australian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, and Japanese Yen. Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Xizhi, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year\n‐\nend exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments denominated in U.S. Dollars.\nMost European subsidiaries use the Euro as the functional currency. The functional currency of our largest European subsidiary, Garmin (Europe) Ltd. remains the U.S. Dollar, and as some transactions occur in British Pounds Sterling or Euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar. The Company believes that gains and losses may become more material in the future as our European presence grows.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Company incurred a net foreign currency gain of $2.8 million. The U.S. Dollar weakening against the Euro, Australian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, and British Pound Sterling was partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Taiwan Dollar. During fiscal 2020, the U.S. Dollar weakened 9.2% against the Euro, 9.4% against the Australian Dollar, 7.2% against the Chinese Yuan, and 3.6% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in gains of $21.1 million, $6.5 million, $2.9 million, and $2.6 million, respectively, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 7.1% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a loss of $32.2 million. The remaining net currency gain of $1.9 million was related to the timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies, each of which was individually immaterial. These and other currency moves during fiscal year 2020 also resulted in a currency translation adjustment of $107.7 million within Accumulated other comprehensive income.\nWe assessed the Company’s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations. Based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse changes of 10% for the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $84 million and $90 million at December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe have no outstanding long-term debt as of December 26, 2020. We, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities. As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly.\nThe Company’s investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity. During 2020 and 2019, the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities.\nWe assessed the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the Company’s portfolio of marketable securities. Based on balance sheet positions as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all securities would have resulted in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately $34 million and $35 million at December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\n46"

    "text": "CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nGarmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries\nYears Ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018\nContents\n47\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 17, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of Goodwill\n48\nMeasurement of Reserve for Unrecognized Income Tax Benefits\n49\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1990.\nKansas City, Missouri\nFebruary 17, 2021\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\nSee accompanying notes.\n56\nGarmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except share and per share information)\nDecember 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019\n1. Description of the Business\nGarmin Ltd. and subsidiaries (together, the “Company”) design, develop, manufacture, market, and distribute a diverse family of hand-held, wrist-based, portable, and fixed-mount Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled products and other navigation, communications, information and sensor-based products. Garmin Corporation (GC) is primarily responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the Company’s products to the Company’s subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, new product development and sales and marketing of the Company’s products in Asia and the Far East. Garmin International, Inc. (GII) is primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the Company’s products in the Americas region and for most of the Company’s research and new product development. GII also manufactures most of the Company’s products in the aviation segment. Garmin (Europe) Ltd. (GEL) is responsible for sales and marketing of the Company’s products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Many of GEL’s sales are to other Company-owned distributors in the EMEA region.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of Garmin Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified or presented to conform to current period presentation.\nFiscal Year\nThe Company’s fiscal year is based on a 52-53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year. Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks in a calendar year, and there is slightly more than one additional day per year (not including the effects of leap year) in each calendar year as compared to a 52-week fiscal year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain fiscal years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year occurs.\nIn those resulting fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra week of sales, costs, and related financial activity. Therefore, the financial results of those 53-week fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarters, will not be entirely comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and the associated 13-week quarters. Fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 each included 52 weeks.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n57\nForeign Currency\nMany Garmin Ltd. subsidiaries utilize currencies other than the United States Dollar (USD) as their functional currency. As required by the Foreign Currency Matters topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), the financial statements of these subsidiaries for all periods presented have been translated into USD, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd., and the reporting currency herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing during the year for sales, costs, and expenses and at end-of-year rates for all assets and liabilities. The effect of this translation is recorded in a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Cumulative currency translation adjustments of $\n162,953\nand $\n55,289\nas of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively, have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date. Assets and liabilities resulting from these transactions are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables, and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity. Net foreign currency gains recorded in results of operations were $\n2,825\nfor the year ended December 26, 2020, and net foreign currency losses recorded in results of operations were $\n16,799\n, and $\n7,616\n, for the years ended December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018, respectively. The gain in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Euro, Australian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, and British Pound Sterling, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the Taiwan Dollar. The loss in fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Euro and weakening against the Taiwan Dollar, which was partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the British Pound Sterling. The loss in fiscal 2018 was due primarily to the USD strengthening against the Euro and British Pound Sterling, offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. For purposes of diluted earnings per share, the number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive share-based compensation awards has been reduced by the number of shares which could have been purchased from the proceeds of the exercise or release at the average market price of the Company’s stock during the period the awards were outstanding. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, operating accounts, money market funds, deposits readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value, given the short maturity of those instruments. Restricted cash is reported separately from cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restricted cash.\nThe total of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet reconciles to the total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nTrade Accounts Receivable\nThe Company sells its products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extends credit based on its evaluation of the customer’s financial condition. Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer’s financial condition. The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. Typically, its accounts receivable are collected within 90 days and do not bear interest. The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses or adjustments. The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables and (2) reviewing its high-risk customers. Past due receivable balances are written off when internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due. The Company maintains trade credit insurance to provide some security against certain losses within policy limits.\n58\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company’s pre-established credit requirements. Generally, the Company does not require security when trade credit is granted to customers. Credit losses are provided for in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and typically have been within management’s expectations. Certain customers are allowed extended terms consistent with normal industry practice. Most of these extended terms can be classified as either relating to seasonal sales variations or to the timing of new product releases by the Company.\nThe Company’s top ten customers have contributed between\n20\n% and\n23\n% of net sales annually since 2018.\nNone\nof the Company’s customers accounted for more than or equal to 10% of consolidated net sales in the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018, respectively.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead associated with purchases and production and is determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.\nIf actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Inventories consisted of the following:\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost and typically depreciated using the straight-line method. The components of property and equipment were as follows and are generally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives:\nAs required by the\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\ntopic of the FASB ASC (ASC Topic 360), the Company reviews property and equipment assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. The Company did not recognize any material long-lived asset impairment charges in the fiscal years of 2020, 2019, or 2018.\n59\nIntangible Assets\nAt December 26, 2020, and December 28, 2019, the Company had patents, customer related intangibles and other identifiable finite-lived intangible assets recorded at a cost of $\n523,990\nand $\n432,296\n, respectively. Identifiable, finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis typically over\nthree\nto\nten\nyears\n. Accumulated amortization was $\n279,633\nand $\n239,776\nat December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively. Amortization expense on these intangible assets was $\n34,797\n, $\n26,225\n, and $\n21,796\nfor the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018, respectively. In the next five years, the amortization expense is estimated to be $\n33,371\n, $\n30,255\n, $\n28,309\n, $\n26,357\n, and $\n23,941\n, respectively. The Company also reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 360, as described above, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable.\nThe Company’s excess purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) was $\n584,210\nat December 26, 2020, and $\n467,108\nat December 28, 2019.\nThe\nIntangibles – Goodwill and Other\ntopic of the FASB ASC (ASC Topic 350) requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be assessed for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The Company performs its annual impairment assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, if any, in the fourth quarter of each year, as of the Company’s fiscal year end date. ASC Topic 350 allows management to first perform a qualitative assessment by assessing the qualitative factors of relevant events and circumstances at the reporting unit level to determine if it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then the quantitative test will be performed. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then a goodwill impairment charge will be recognized in the amount by which carrying amount exceeds fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nEach of the Company’s operating segments (auto OEM, aviation, consumer auto, fitness, marine, and outdoor) represents a distinct reporting unit. The consumer auto market has declined in recent years as competing technologies have emerged and market saturation has occurred. This has resulted in periods of lower revenues and profits for the Company’s consumer auto reporting unit. Considering these qualitative factors, management performed a quantitative impairment test of the consumer auto reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2020 and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying amount. However, considering the uncertainty of future operating results and/or market conditions deteriorating faster or more drastically than the forecasts utilized in management’s estimation of fair value, management believes some or all of the approximately $\n80\nmillion of goodwill associated with the Company’s consumer auto reporting unit is at risk of future impairment.\nManagement concluded that no other reporting units are currently at risk of impairment, and the Company did not recognize any material goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal years 2020, 2019, or 2018.\n60\nLeases\nThe Company leases certain real estate properties, vehicles, and equipment in various countries around the world. Leased properties are typically used for office space, distribution, and retail. The Company’s leases are classified as operating leases with remaining terms of\n1\nto\n33\nyears\n, some of which include an option to extend or renew. If the exercise of an option to extend or renew is determined to be reasonably certain, the associated right-of-use asset and lease liability reflects the extended period and payments. For newly signed leases, the right-of-use asset and lease liability is recognized on lease commencement date. Variable lease costs, such as adjustments to payments based on consumer price indices, are excluded in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. For all real estate leases, any non-lease components, including common area maintenance, have been separated from lease components and excluded from the associated right-of-use asset and lease liability calculations. For all equipment and vehicle leases, an accounting policy election has been made to not separate lease and non-lease components.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less (“short-term leases”) are not recognized on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as a right-of-use asset or lease liability.\nDividends\nUnder Swiss corporate law, dividends must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of the Company’s shareholders.\nOn June 5, 2020, the shareholders approved a dividend of $\n2.44\nper share (of which, $\n1.22\nwas paid in the Company’s 2020 fiscal year) payable in four equal installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors. The dates determined by the Board were as follows:\nThe Company paid dividends in 2020 in the amount of $\n450,631\n, which included four dividend distributions in the fiscal year. Both the dividends paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.\nOn June 7, 2019, the shareholders approved a dividend of $\n2.28\nper share (of which, $\n1.14\nwas paid in the Company’s 2019 fiscal year) payable in four equal installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors. The dates determined by the Board were as follows:\nThe Company paid dividends in 2019 in the amount of $\n417,264\n, which included four dividend distributions in the fiscal year. Both the dividends paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.\nOn June 8, 2018, the shareholders approved a dividend of $\n2.12\nper share (of which, $\n1.06\nwas paid in the Company’s 2018 fiscal year) payable in four equal installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors. The dates determined by the Board were as follows:\n61\nThe Company paid dividends in 2018 in the amount of $\n296,148\n, which included three dividend distributions in the fiscal year. Both the dividends paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.\nApproximately $\n61,129\nof retained earnings was indefinitely restricted from distribution to stockholders pursuant to the laws of Taiwan as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019.\nMarketable Securities\nManagement determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.\nAll of the Company’s marketable securities were considered available-for-sale at December 26, 2020. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 26, 2020, cumulative unrealized net gains of $\n20,474\nwere reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related taxes. At December 28, 2019, cumulative unrealized net gains of $\n585\nwere reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related taxes.\nThe Company recognizes impairments relating to credit losses of available-for-sale securities through an allowance for credit losses and Other income (expense) on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Impairment not relating to credit losses is recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nTesting for impairment of investments requires significant management judgment. The identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination of their fair value, and the assessment of whether any decline in value is relating to credit losses are the key judgment elements. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. Revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known, and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time. The economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment.\nIn making this assessment we evaluate the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, any change in credit rating of the security, adverse conditions specifically related to the security, failure of the issuer to make scheduled payments, and other relevant factors affecting the security. If it is determined that a credit loss exists, the amount of the credit loss is determined by comparing the present value of the expected future cash flows for the security to the amortized cost basis of the security, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis.\nThe amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security. Such amortization and realized gains/losses are recorded within Interest income and Other income (expense), respectively, on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.\nInvestments are discussed in detail in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n62\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the FASB ASC 740 topic\nIncome Taxes\n. The liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured based on the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with the FASB ASC 740 topic\nIncome Taxes\n. The Company recognizes liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves not to be required, the reversal of the liabilities results in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.\nIncome taxes are discussed in detail in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to the customer in an amount that depicts the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to for the related products or services. For the large majority of the Company’s sales, transfer of control occurs once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. The Company offers certain tangible products with ongoing services promised over a period of time, typically the useful life of the related tangible product. When such services have been identified as both capable of being distinct and separately identifiable from the related tangible product, the associated revenue allocated to such services is recognized over time. The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.\nThe Company allocates revenue to all performance obligations associated with tangible products containing separately identifiable ongoing services based on the respective performance obligations’ relative standalone selling prices (“SSP”), with the amounts allocated to ongoing services deferred and recognized over a period of time. These ongoing services primarily consist of the Company’s contractual promises to provide personal navigation device (PND) users with map updates and server-based traffic services. In addition, we provide map update services (map care) over a contractual period in certain hardware and software contracts with original automotive equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The Company has determined that directly observable prices do not exist for map updates, map care, or server-based traffic, as stand-alone and unbundled unit sales do not occur on more than a limited basis. Therefore, the Company uses the expected cost plus a margin as the primary indicator to calculate relative SSP of map updates, map care, and traffic performance obligations. The revenue and associated costs allocated to map updates, map care, and/or the server-based traffic service are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated life of the products of approximately\n3\nyears for PNDs, or the estimated map care period in OEM contracts of\n3\n-\n10\nyears\nas we believe our efforts related to providing these services are spread evenly throughout the performance period. In addition to the products listed above, the Company has offered certain other products with ongoing performance obligations including mobile applications, incremental navigation and communication service subscriptions, aviation database subscriptions, and extended warranties that are recognized over the contractual service period (typically\n1\n-\n3\nyears\n).\n63\nThe Company records revenue net of sales tax and variable consideration such as trade discounts and customer returns. Payment is due typically within\n90\ndays or less of shipment of product, or upon the grant of a given software license (as applicable). The Company records estimated reductions to revenue in the form of variable consideration for customer sales programs, returns, and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases), promotions, and other volume-based incentives. Cooperative advertising incentives payable to dealers and distributors are recorded as reductions of revenue unless we obtain proof of a distinct advertising service, in which case we record the incentive as advertising expense. The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions. Changes in these estimates could negatively affect the Company’s operating results. These incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions, typically accrued for on a percentage of sales basis.\nDeferred Revenues and Costs\nAt December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the Company had deferred revenues totaling $\n136,799\nand $\n161,891\n, respectively, and related deferred costs totaling $\n36,655\nand $\n48,598\n, respectively.\nDeferred revenue consists primarily of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are recognized over a period of time basis as discussed in the\nRevenue Recognition\nportion of this footnote. Billings associated with such items are typically completed upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to the customer and recorded to accounts receivable until payment is received. Deferred costs primarily refer to the royalties incurred by the Company associated with the aforementioned unsatisfied performance obligations, which are amortized over the same period as the revenue is recognized. The Company typically pays the associated royalties either monthly or quarterly in arrears, on a per item shipped or installed basis.\nThe Company applies a practical expedient, as permitted within ASC 340, to expense as incurred the incremental costs to obtain a contract when the amortization period of the asset that would have otherwise been recognized is one year or less.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nShipping and handling activities are typically performed before the customer obtains control of the good, and the related costs are therefore expensed as incurred. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n64\nProduct Warranty\nThe Company accrues for estimated future warranty costs at the time products are sold. The Company’s standard warranty obligation to retail partners generally provides for a right of return of any product for a full refund in the event that such product is not merchantable, is damaged, or is defective. The Company’s historical experience is that these types of warranty obligations are generally fulfilled within 5 months from time of sale. The Company’s standard warranty obligation to its end-users provides for a period of\none\nto\ntwo\nyears\nfrom date of shipment while certain aviation, marine, and auto OEM products have a warranty period of\ntwo years\nor more from the date of installation.\nThe Company’s estimates of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience and management’s expectations and judgments of future conditions. To the extent the Company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty accrual will increase, which may result in decreased gross profit.\nThe following reconciliation presents details of the changes in the Company’s accrued warranty costs:\n(1)\nChanges in cost estimates related to pre-existing warranties were not material and aggregated with accruals for new warranty contracts in the ‘accrual for products sold’ line.\nAdvertising Costs\nThe Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense amounted to approximately $\n151,166\n, $\n164,456\n, and $\n155,394\nfor the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018, respectively.\nResearch and Development\nA majority of the Company’s research and development is performed in the United States. Research and development costs, which are typically expensed as incurred, amounted to approximately $\n705,685\n, $\n605,366\n, and $\n567,805\nfor the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018, respectively.\n65\nPreproduction Costs Related to Long-Term Supply Arrangements\nPreproduction design and development costs related to long-term supply arrangements are expensed as incurred, and classified as Research and development, unless the customer has provided a contractual guarantee for reimbursement of such costs. Contractually reimbursable costs are capitalized as incurred in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Prepaid expenses and other current assets if reimbursement is expected to be received within one year, or within Other assets if expected to be received beyond one year. Such capitalized costs were approximately $\n63,610\nand $\n24,267\nas of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively.\nCustomer Service and Technical Support\nCustomer service and technical support costs are included as selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through websites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers. The technical support is typically provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized. The related cost of providing this free support is not material.\nSoftware Development Costs\nThe FASB ASC topic entitled\nSoftware\nrequires companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. The Company’s capitalized software development costs are not significant, as the time elapsed from working model to release is typically short. As required by the Research and Development topic of the FASB ASC, costs incurred to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company currently sponsors three stock-based employee compensation plans. The FASB ASC topic entitled Compensation – Stock Compensation requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options and restricted stock, based on estimated fair values.\nAccounting guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nAs stock-based compensation expenses recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income are based on awards ultimately expected to vest, they have been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience and management’s estimates.\nExcess tax benefits or deficiencies from stock-based compensation are recognized in the income tax provision and are not estimated in the effective tax rate, rather, are recorded as discrete tax items in the period they occur. Excess income tax benefits from stock-based compensation arrangements are classified as a cash flow from operations.\nStock compensation plans are discussed in detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n66\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 changes how entities assess and measure credit losses of certain financial instruments, including available-for-sale securities and accounts receivable. The Company adopted the new standard as of the beginning of the 2020 fiscal year. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nReceivables – Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-08, Receivables – Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Topic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities (“ASU 2017-08”), which shortens the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium, requiring the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. The Company adopted the new standard as of the beginning of the 2020 fiscal year. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. The FASB subsequently issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-10 and Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-11 in July 2018, which provide clarifications and improvements to ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the “new lease standard”). Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-11 also provides the optional transition method which allows companies to apply the new lease standard at the adoption date instead of at the earliest comparative period presented. The new lease standard requires lessees to present a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet.\nThe Company adopted the new lease standard as of the beginning of the 2019 fiscal year using the optional transition method. The Company did not have a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as a result of adopting the new lease standard and does not expect the new lease standard to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in future periods. The Company elected the package of transitional practical expedients upon adoption which, among other provisions, allowed the Company to carry forward historical lease classification. See Note 14 – Leases for additional information regarding leases.\nIntangible – Goodwill and Other\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Intangible – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplify the Test for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU 2017-04”) which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment. ASU 2017-04 removes “step two” of the goodwill impairment test, such that a goodwill impairment charge is now the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. ASU 2017-04 is applied prospectively and was effective for fiscal years, or any goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption was permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. The Company early adopted ASU 2017-04 in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 28, 2019. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nWe do not expect any recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, accounting policies, processes, or systems upon adoption.\n67\n3. Marketable Securities\nThe FASB ASC topic entitled\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\ndefines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The accounting guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:\nThe Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation is based on prices obtained from an independent pricing vendor using both market and income approaches. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, and credit spreads.\nThe method described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nMarketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are summarized below:\n68\nThe Company’s investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors.\nAccrued interest receivable, which totaled $\n10,176\nas of December 26, 2020, is excluded from both the fair value and amortized cost basis of available-for-sale securities and is included within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company writes off impaired accrued interest on a timely basis, generally within 30 days of the due date, by reversing interest income.\nNo\naccrued interest was written off during the 52-week period ended December 26, 2020.\nThe Company recognizes impairments relating to credit losses of available-for-sale securities through an allowance for credit losses and Other income (expense) on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Impairment not relating to credit losses is recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss) on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Approximately\n21\n% of securities in our portfolio were at an unrealized loss position at December 26, 2020.\nThe following tables display additional information regarding gross unrealized losses and fair value by major security type for available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019.\nAs of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the Company had not recognized an allowance for credit losses on any securities in an unrealized loss position.\nThe Company has not recorded an allowance for credit losses and charge to Other income for the unrealized losses on mortgage-backed, corporate, municipal, and other securities presented above because we do not consider the declines in fair value to have resulted from credit losses. We have not observed a significant deterioration in credit quality of these securities, which are highly rated with moderate to low credit risk. Declines in value are largely attributable to current global economic conditions. The securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments, and the fair values are expected to recover as they approach maturity. The Company does not intend to sell the securities, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities, before the respective recoveries of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity.\n69\nThe amortized cost and fair value of marketable securities at December 26, 2020, by maturity, are shown below.\n4. Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nThe Company is party to certain commitments, which include purchases of raw materials, capital expenditures, advertising, and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business. The aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of December 26, 2020 was approximately $\n880,000\n. We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are generally based on our current needs and typically fulfilled by our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers within short periods of time.\nCertain cash balances are held as collateral in relation to bank guarantees. The total amount of restricted cash was $\n306\nand $\n71\non December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively.\nContingencies\nIn the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, investigations and complaints, including matters alleging patent infringement and other intellectual property claims. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly and annual basis, developments in legal proceedings, investigations, claims, and other loss contingencies that could affect any required accrual or disclosure or estimate of reasonably possible loss or range of loss. An estimated loss from a loss contingency is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If a range of loss is estimated, and some amount within that range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within that range, then that amount is accrued. If no amount within the range can be identified as a better estimate than any other amount, the Company accrues the minimum amount in the range.\nIf an outcome unfavorable to the Company is determined to be probable, but the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated or is determined to be reasonably possible, but not probable, we disclose the nature of the contingency and an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company’s aggregate range of reasonably possible losses includes (1) matters where a liability has been accrued and there is a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued for that liability, and (2) matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, and a liability therefore has not been accrued. This aggregate range only represents the Company’s estimate of reasonably possible losses and does not represent the Company’s maximum loss exposure. The assessment regarding whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. In assessing the probability of an outcome in a lawsuit, claim or assessment that could be unfavorable to the Company, we consider the following factors, among others: a) the nature of the litigation, claim, or assessment; b) the progress of the case; c) the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers; d) our experience in similar cases; e) the experience of other entities in similar cases; and f) how we intend to respond to the lawsuit, claim, or assessment. Costs incurred in defending lawsuits, claims or assessments are expensed as incurred.\n70\nManagement of the Company currently does not believe it is reasonably possible that the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of recorded accruals, with respect to loss contingencies in the aggregate, for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020. The results of legal proceedings, investigations and claims, however, cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse resolution of one or more of such matters in excess of management’s expectations could have a material adverse effect in the particular quarter or fiscal year in which a loss is recorded, but based on information currently known, the Company does not believe it is likely that losses from such matters would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company settled or resolved certain legal matters during the fiscal years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n5. Employee Benefit Plans\nCertain subsidiaries of the Company sponsor various defined contribution employee retirement plans. GII and the Company’s other U.S.-based subsidiaries sponsor a plan under which their employees may contribute up to\n50\n% of their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum limitations and to which the subsidiaries contribute a specified percentage of each participant’s annual compensation up to certain limits as defined in the retirement plan. During the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018, expense related to this and other defined contribution plans of $\n63,908\n, $\n55,456\n, and $\n52,232\n, respectively, was recorded within the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.\nCertain of the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor or participate in local defined benefit pension plans for which contributions are calculated by formulas that consider final pensionable salaries. The obligations, contributions, and associated expense of such plans for the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018 were not material.\n6. Income Taxes\nThe Company’s income tax provision (benefit) consists of the following:\n71\nThe income tax provision differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to income before taxes.\nThe sources and tax effects of the differences, including the impact of establishing tax contingency accruals, are as follows:\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $\n111,086\nin the year ended December 26, 2020, which included a $\n14,308\nincome tax benefit recognized by the Company in the second quarter of 2020 due to the release of uncertain tax position reserves associated with a 2014 intercompany restructuring and was partially offset by income tax expense of $\n11,016\nrecognized by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to the revaluation of certain Switzerland tax assets related to the Switzerland tax reform transitional measures. The Company recorded income tax expense of $\n34,736\nin the year ended December 28, 2019, which included an income tax benefit of $\n117,989\nrelated to the revaluation and step-up of certain Switzerland tax assets as a result of the October 2019 enactment of Switzerland federal and Schaffhausen cantonal tax reform and related transitional measures.\nThe Company’s statutory federal and cantonal income tax rate in Switzerland, the Company's place of incorporation, is\n14.03\n%. If the Company reconciled taxes at the Swiss holding company federal statutory tax rate to the reported income tax expense for 2020 as presented above, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $\n77,000\nlower, or $\n155,000\n, and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $\n20,000\n. The Company’s statutory federal income tax rate in Switzerland prior to 2020 was\n7.83\n%. For 2019, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $\n130,000\nlower, or $\n77,000\n, and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $\n73,000\n. For 2018, the amount related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $\n108,000\nlower, or $\n65,000\n, and the foreign tax differential would be reduced by a similar amount to approximately $\n65,000\n. All other amounts would remain substantially unchanged.\nThe Company’s income before income taxes attributable to non-U.S. operations was $\n1,059,074\n, $\n606,711\n, and $\n532,657\n, for the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018, respectively.\nIncome taxes of $\n47,236\n, $\n35,982\n, and $\n36,800\nat December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018, respectively, have not been accrued by the Company for the unremitted earnings of several of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be reinvested in the subsidiaries indefinitely.\n72\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.\nSignificant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\n73\nAt December 26, 2020, the Company had $\n18,523\nof tax credit carryover compared to $\n11,164\nat December 28, 2019. At December 26, 2020, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $\n5,566\nrelated to the future tax benefit of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $\n29,025\n. Included in the NOL carryforwards is $\n16,980\nthat relates to Switzerland and expires in\n2027\n, $\n4,990\nthat relates to Luxembourg and expires in\n2037\n, $\n409\nthat relates to Finland and expires in varying amounts between\n2025\nand\n2028\n, $\n607\nthat relates to the Netherlands and expires in\n2026\n, $\n249\nthat relates to Thailand and expires in\n2025\n, $\n54\nthat relates to Vietnam and expires in\n2025\n, and $\n5,736\nthat relates to various other jurisdictions and has no expiration date. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of its deferred tax asset relating to various tax attributes that it does not believe are more likely than not to be realized. In the future, if the Company determines, based on existence of sufficient evidence, that it should realize more or less of its deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made in the period such a determination is made.\nThe total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, as of December 26, 2020 was $\n84,985\n. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018 is as follows:\nAccounting guidance requires unrecognized tax benefits to be classified as noncurrent liabilities, except for the portion that is expected to be paid within one year of the balance sheet date. The balance of net unrecognized benefits of $\n81,938\n, $\n92,056\n, and $\n114,682\nare required to be classified as noncurrent at December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018, respectively. The net unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate. None of the unrecognized tax benefits are due to uncertainty in the timing of deductibility.\nInterest and penalties, if any, accrued on the unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in income tax expense. At December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018, the Company had accrued approximately $\n5,666\n, $\n7,636\n, and $\n6,613\n, respectively, for interest. The interest component of the reserve decreased income tax expense for the year ending December 26, 2020 by $\n1,970\n, and increased income tax expense for the years ending December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018, by $\n1,023\n, and $\n1,008\n, respectively. The Company did\nno\nt have significant amounts accrued for penalties for the years ending December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018.\nThe Company files income tax returns in Switzerland, U.S. federal jurisdiction, as well as various states, local, and foreign jurisdictions. In its major tax jurisdictions, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and U.S. federal and various states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities, with few exceptions, for years prior to 2016, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively.\nThe Company recognized a reduction of income tax expense of $\n42,185\n, $\n26,158\n, and $\n27,106\nin fiscal years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018, respectively, to reflect the expiration of statutes of limitations and releases due to audit settlement in various jurisdictions.\nThe Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $\n5,000\nto $\n25,000\nof its reserves for certain unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next 12 months as the result of the expiration of statutes of limitations. This potential decrease in unrecognized tax benefits would impact the Company’s effective tax rate within the next 12 months.\n74\n7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nAs required by the\nFinancial Instruments\ntopic of the FASB ASC, the following summarizes required information about the fair value of certain financial instruments for which it is currently practicable to estimate such value. None of the financial instruments are held or issued for trading purposes.\nThe carrying amounts and fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:\nFor certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.\n8. Segment Information\nGarmin is organized in the\nsix\noperating segments of auto OEM, aviation, consumer auto, fitness, marine, and outdoor. The consumer auto operating segment was previously referred to as our auto PND operating segment. We have revised the name of this operating segment to reflect the evolution of the product lines and focus of that part of our business. The name change did not impact the composition or operating results of the segment. Each operating segment is individually reviewed and evaluated by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who allocates resources and assesses performance of each segment individually. The aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor operating segments represent\nreportable segments. The auto OEM and consumer auto operating segments, which serve the auto market, do not meet the quantitative thresholds to separately qualify as reportable segments, and they are therefore reported together in an “all other” category captioned as auto. Auto, aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor are collectively referred to as our reported segments.\nThe products of the Company’s segments are sold through the Company’s network of independent dealers and distributors, our own webshop, as well as through various auto, aviation, and marine OEMs. However, the nature of products and types of customers for the segments vary.\nThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who has been identified as the CODM, uses operating income as the measure of profit or loss, combined with other measures, to assess segment performance and allocate resources. Operating income represents net sales less costs of goods sold and operating expenses. Net sales are directly attributed to each segment. Most costs of goods sold and the majority of operating expenses are also directly attributed to each segment, while certain other costs of goods sold and operating expenses are allocated to the segments in a manner appropriate to the specific facts and circumstances of the expenses being allocated. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. There are no inter-segment sales or transfers.\nThe Company’s segments share many common resources, infrastructures and assets in the normal course of business. Thus, the Company does not report accounts receivable, inventories, property and equipment, intangible assets, or capital expenditures by segment to the CODM.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the methodology used to allocate certain selling, general, and administrative expenses to the segments was refined, endeavoring to provide the Company’s CODM with a more meaningful representation of segment profit or loss in light of the evolution of its segments. The Company’s composition of operating segments and reportable segments did not change. Results for the 52-weeks ended December 29, 2018 are presented here as they were originally reported, as it is not practicable to accurately restate the activity in accordance with the refined allocation methodology. For comparative purposes, we estimate operating income for the 52-weeks ended December 29, 2018 would have been approximately $\n18\nmillion less for aviation, approximately $\n11\nmillion more for marine, approximately $\n7\nmillion more for outdoor, and not significantly different for auto and fitness.\n75\nNet sales (“revenue”), gross profit, and operating income for each of the Company’s\nfive\nreported segments are presented below, along with supplemental financial information for the auto OEM and consumer auto operating segments that management believes is useful.\nNet sales, property and equipment, and net assets by geographic area are as shown below for the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018. Note that APAC includes Asia Pacific and Australian Continent, and EMEA includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n76\n9. Stock Compensation Plans\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nThe various Company stock compensation plans are summarized below. For all stock compensation plans, the Company’s policy is to issue treasury shares for option/stock appreciation right (SAR) exercises, restricted stock unit (RSU) releases and employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) purchases.\n2011 Non-employee Directors’ Equity Incentive Plan\nIn June 2011, the stockholders adopted an equity incentive plan for non-employee directors (the “2011 Directors Plan”) providing for grants of stock options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares, pursuant to which up to\n122,592\nshares were available for issuance. The term of each award cannot exceed\nten years\n. Awards are subject to a minimum\none-year\nvesting period. In 2020, 2019, and 2018,\n6,376\n,\n8,016\n, and\n10,376\nRSUs were granted under this plan.\n2005 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn June 2005, the shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the “2005 Plan”) providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which up to\n10,000,000\ncommon shares were available for issuance. In 2013, the shareholders approved an additional\n3,000,000\nshares to the plan, making the total shares authorized under the plan\n13,000,000\n. Option and SAR grants vest evenly over a period of\nfive years\nor as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire\nten years\nfrom the date of grant, if not exercised.\nRSUs granted prior to December 10, 2012 vested evenly over a period of five years\n, while RSUs granted on and after that date vested or are vesting evenly over a period of\nthree years\n. In addition to time-based vesting requirements, the vesting of certain RSU grants is also contingent upon the Company’s achievement of certain financial performance goals. During 2020, 2019, and 2018,\n753,976\n,\n786,346\n, and\n1,040,001\nRSUs were granted under the 2005 Plan.\nNo\nSARs were granted under the 2005 Plan in 2020, 2019, or 2018.\n2000 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn October 2000, the shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the “2000 Plan”) providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which up to\n7,000,000\ncommon shares were available for issuance. The stock options and SARs vest evenly over a period of\nfive years\nor as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire\nten years\nfrom the date of grant, if not exercised. The Company did\nno\nt grant any stock awards from the 2000 Plan in 2020, 2019, or 2018.\nStock-Based Compensation Activity\nA summary of the Company’s stock-based compensation activity and related information under the 2011 Directors Plan, the 2005 Plan, and the 2000 Plan for the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018 is provided below:\n77\n78\nThe weighted-average remaining contract life for stock options and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 26, 2020 were\n3.97\nyears\n. The weighted-average remaining contract life of restricted stock units at December 26, 2020 was\n1.18\nyears.\nThe total fair value of awards vested during 2020, 2019, and 2018, was $\n58,602\n, $\n52,780\n, and $\n41,092\n, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic values of options and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 26, 2020 were $\n859\n. The aggregate intrinsic values of options and SARs exercised during 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $\n3,701\n, $\n952\n, and $\n4,452\n, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs outstanding at December 26, 2020 was $\n190,203\n. The aggregate intrinsic values of RSUs released during 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $\n109,952\n, $\n103,702\n, and $\n60,361\n, respectively. Aggregate intrinsic value of options and SARs represents the applicable number of awards multiplied by the positive difference between the exercise price and the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the relevant fiscal period. Aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs represents the applicable number of awards multiplied by the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the relevant fiscal period. The Company’s closing stock price was $\n120.21\non December 26, 2020 (based on the closing stock price on December 25, 2020). As of December 26, 2020, there was $\n98,315\nof total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation awards granted to employees under the stock compensation plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe shareholders have adopted an ESPP. Up to\n8,000,000\nshares of common stock have been reserved for the ESPP. Shares are offered to employees at a price equal to the lesser of\n85\n% of the fair market value of the stock on the date of purchase or\n85\n% of the fair market value on the first day of the ESPP period. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. During 2020, 2019, and 2018,\n195,540\n,\n451,625\n, and\n463,066\nshares, respectively, were purchased under the plan for a total purchase price of $\n15,955\n, $\n27,048\n, and $\n23,709\n, respectively. During 2020, 2019, and 2018, the purchases were issued from treasury shares. At December 26, 2020, approximately\n1,860,115\nshares were available for future issuance. On December 30, 2020, subsequent to Garmin’s fiscal 2020 year end,\n215,143\nshares were purchased under the plan for a total purchase price of $\n17,762\n.\n10. Earnings Per Share\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share:\nThere were\n307,724\nand\n297,995\noutstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock units (collectively “equity awards”) excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the 2020 and 2019 fiscal years, respectively, because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.\n79\n11. Share Repurchase Plan\nOn February 13, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to $\n300,000\nof its common shares through December 31, 2016. In December 2016, the Board of Directors authorized an extension through\nDecember 31, 2017\nto purchase remaining common shares. The Company did\nno\nt repurchase any shares in fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018.\n12. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nThe following provides required disclosure of changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) balances by component for the year ended December 26, 2020:\n13. Revenue\nIn order to further depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors, we disaggregate revenue (or “net sales”) by geographic region, major product category, and pattern of recognition.\nDisaggregated revenue by geographic region (Americas, APAC, and EMEA) is presented in Note 8 – Segment Information. Note 8 also contains disaggregated revenue information of the six major product categories identified by the Company – auto OEM, aviation, consumer auto, fitness, marine, and outdoor.\nA large majority of the Company’s sales are recognized on a point in time basis, usually once the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. Sales recognized over a period of time are primarily within the auto segment and relate to performance obligations that are satisfied over the life of the product or contractual service period. Revenue disaggregated by the timing of transfer of the goods or services is presented in the table below:\nTransaction price and costs associated with the Company’s unsatisfied performance obligations are reflected as deferred revenue and deferred costs, respectively, on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such amounts are recognized ratably over the applicable service period or estimated useful life. Changes in deferred revenue and costs during the 52-week periods ending December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, are presented below:\n80\nOf the $\n188,322\nof deferred revenue recognized in the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2020, $\n92,618\nwas deferred as of the beginning of the period. Of the $\n179,790\nof deferred revenue recognized in the 52-weeks ended December 28, 2019, $\n95,009\nwas deferred as of the beginning of the period.\nOf the $\n136,799\nand $\n161,891\nof deferred revenue at the end of the periods, December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively,\napproximately two-thirds is recognized ratably over a period of three years or less.\n81\n14. Leases\nThe following table represents lease costs recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income for the 52-weeks ended December 26, 2020. Lease costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expense and Research and development expense on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.\n(1)\nOperating lease cost includes short-term lease costs and variable lease costs, which were not material in the period presented.\nPrior to the adoption of the new lease standard, lease expense for the year ended December 29, 2018 was $\n21,096\n.\nThe following table represents the components of leases that are recognized on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019.\nThe following table represents the maturity of lease liabilities.\nThe following table presents supplemental cash flow and noncash information related to leases.\n(2)\nIncluded in Net cash provided by operating activities on the Company's Statements of Cash Flows\n82\n15. Selected Quarterly Information (Unaudited)\nThe above quarterly financial data is unaudited, but in the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the selected data for these interim periods presented have been included. These results are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly results, and the table may not foot due to rounding.\n16. Subsequent Events\nOn December 31, 2020, subsequent to Garmin’s fiscal 2020 year end, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of GEOS Worldwide Limited and its subsidiaries, a privately held provider of emergency monitoring and incident response services. This acquisition was not material.\n83"

Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” (2013 framework).\nBased on such assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020.\nErnst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements, issued an attestation report on management’s effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, as stated in their report which is included herein. That attestation report appears below.\n84\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 17, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n85\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nKansas City, Missouri\nFebruary 17, 2021\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 26, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting."
