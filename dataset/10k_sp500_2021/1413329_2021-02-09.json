    "text": "General Development of Business\nGeneral\nPhilip Morris International Inc. is a Virginia holding company incorporated in 1987. We are a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, as well as smoke-free products, associated electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the United States of America.  In addition, we ship versions of our Platform 1 device and consumables to Altria Group, Inc. for sale under license in the United States, where these products have received marketing authorizations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") under the premarket tobacco product application (\"PMTA\") pathway; the FDA has also authorized the marketing of a version of our Platform 1 device and its consumables as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\"), finding that an exposure modification order for these products is appropriate to promote the public health.\nWe are leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future, based on a new category of reduced-risk products that, while not risk free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke. Our goal is to ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company and its shareholders.\nReduced-risk products (\"RRPs\") is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continuing smoking. We have a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Because our RRPs do not burn tobacco, they produce an aerosol that contains far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke.  Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, we aim to ensure that our RRPs meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements.\nOur\nIQOS\nsmoke-free\nproduct brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products.  Our leading smoke-free platform (\"Platform 1\") is a precisely controlled device into which a specially designed heated tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. Heated tobacco units (\"HTU\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which for us include our\nHEETS\n,\nHEETS Creations, HEETS Dimensions, HEETS Marlboro\nand\nHEETS FROM MARLBORO (\ndefined collectively as\nHEETS)\n,\nMarlboro Dimensions\n,\nMarlboro\nHeatSticks\nand\nParliament HeatSticks,\nas well as the KT&G-licensed brands,\nFiit\nand\nMiix\n(outside of Korea).  Platform 1\nwas first introduced in Nagoya, Japan, in 2014. As of December 31, 2020, Platform 1\nis available for sale in 64 markets in key cities or nationwide.\nOur cigarettes are sold in more than 175 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by\nMarlboro\n, the world’s best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 37% of our total 2020 cigarette shipment volume.\nMarlboro\nis complemented in the premium-price category by\nParliament\n. Our other leading international cigarette brands are\nBond Street, Chesterfield, L&M\n,\nLark\nand\nPhilip Morris.\nThese seven international cigarette brands contributed approximately 79% of our cigarette shipment volume in 2020. We also own a number of important local cigarette brands, such as\nDji Sam Soe\n,\nSampoerna A\nand\nSampoerna U\nin Indonesia, and\nFortune\nand\nJackpot\nin the Philippines.\nSource of Funds — Dividends\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized. As a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions that are otherwise compliant with law.\n1\nDescription of Business\nWe manage our business in six operating segments as follows:\n•\nThe European Union Region (“EU”) is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries and also Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and the United Kingdom;\n•\nThe Eastern Europe Region (“EE”) is also headquartered in Lausanne and includes Southeast Europe, Central Asia, Ukraine, Israel and Russia;\n•\nThe Middle East & Africa Region (“ME&A”) is also headquartered in Lausanne and covers the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey and our international duty free business;\n•\nThe South & Southeast Asia Region (“S&SA”) is headquartered in Hong Kong and includes Indonesia, the Philippines and other markets in this region;\n•\nThe East Asia & Australia Region (“EA&A”) is also headquartered in Hong Kong and includes Australia, Japan, South Korea, the People's Republic of China and other markets in this region, as well as Malaysia and Singapore; and\n•\nThe Latin America & Canada Region (“LA&C”) is headquartered in New York and covers the South American continent, Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean and Canada.  LA&C also includes transactions under license with Altria Group, Inc., for the distribution of our Platform 1 product in the United States.\nAs of March 22, 2019, we deconsolidated the financial results of our Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (\"RBH\") from our financial statements.  For further details, see Item 8,\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Item 8”) Note 20.\nDeconsolidation of RBH\n.\nFollowing the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary, we will continue to report the volume of brands sold by RBH for which other PMI subsidiaries are the trademark owners.  These include\nHEETS\n,\nNext\n,\nPhilip Morris\nand\nRooftop\n.\nReferences to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the United States, total industry, total market and market shares in this Form 10-K are our estimates for tax-paid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources and may, in defined instances, exclude the People's Republic of China and/or our duty free business.  Unless otherwise stated, references to total industry, total market, our shipment volume and our market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units.  In addition, to reflect the deconsolidation of RBH, effective March 22, 2019, PMI's total market share has been restated for previous periods.\n2020 estimates for total industry volume and market share in certain geographies reflect limitations on the availability and accuracy of industry data during pandemic-related restrictions.\nOur total shipments, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, decreased by 8.1% in 2020 to 704.6 billion units.  We estimate that international industry volumes, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, were approximately 4.9 trillion units in 2020, a 3.0% decrease from 2019.  Excluding the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), we estimate that international cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume was 2.5 trillion units in 2020, a 5.8% decrease from 2019.  We estimate that our reported share of the international market (which is defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume, excluding the United States of America) was approximately 14.4% in 2020, 15.1% in 2019 and 15.2% in 2018.  Excluding the PRC, we estimate that our reported share of the international market was approximately 27.7%, 28.4%, and 28.3% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nShipments of our principal cigarette brand,\nMarlboro\n, decreased by 11.3% in 2020 and represented approximately 9.5% of the international cigarette market, excluding the PRC, in 2020, 10.0% in 2019 and 9.7% in 2018.\nTotal shipment volume of heated tobacco units reached 76.1 billion units in 2020, up from 59.7 billion units in 2019.\nWe have a market share of at least 15% in approximately 95 markets, including Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Egypt, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Kuwait, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine.\n2\nDistribution & Sales\nOur main types of distribution are tailored to the characteristics of each market and are often used simultaneously:\n•\nDirect sales and distribution, where we have set up our own distribution selling directly to the retailers;\n•\nDistribution through independent distributors that often distribute other fast-moving consumer goods and are responsible for distribution in a particular market;\n•\nExclusive zonified distribution, where the distributors are dedicated to us in tobacco products distribution and assigned to exclusive territories within a market;\n•\nDistribution through national or regional wholesalers that then supply the retail trade; and\n•\nOur own brand retail and e-commerce infrastructures for our RRP products and accessories.\nCompetition\nWe are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. In the combustible product category, we predominantly sell American blend cigarette brands, such as\nMarlboro\n,\nL&M\n,\nParliament, Philip Morris\nand\nChesterfield\n, which are the most popular across many of our markets. In the RRP product category, we predominantly sell Platform 1 devices and heated tobacco units under the\nIQOS\nbrand umbrella. We seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories, although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premium-price category.\nThe competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products, higher tobacco product taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products and restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our RRPs. Competitors include three large international tobacco companies, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, the PRC, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Industry consolidation and privatizations of state-owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. Some competitors have different profit and volume objectives, and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates. Certain new market entrants may alienate consumers from innovative products through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior product satisfaction, while not relying on scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our RRPs.\nProcurement and Raw Materials\nWe purchase tobacco leaf of various types, grades and styles throughout the world, mostly through independent tobacco suppliers. In 2020, we also contracted directly with farmers in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Pakistan and Poland. In 2020, direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 25% of PMI’s global leaf requirements. The largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from Argentina, Brazil, China, Italy, Indonesia (mostly for domestic use in kretek products), Malawi, Mozambique, the Philippines, Turkey and the United States.\nWe believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements.\nIn addition to tobacco leaf, we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 400 suppliers. In 2020, our top ten suppliers of direct materials combined represented approximately 55% of our total direct materials purchases. The three most significant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging, acetate tow used in filter making and fine paper used in the manufacturing of cigarettes and heated tobacco units. In addition, the adequate supply and procurement of cloves are of particular importance to our Indonesian business.\nWe discuss the details of our supply chain for our RRPs in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Item 7”) in\nBusiness Environment—Reduced-Risk Products\n.\n3\nBusiness Environment\nInformation called for by this Item is hereby incorporated by reference to the paragraphs in Item 7,\nBusiness Environment\n.\nOther Matters\nCustomers\nAs described in more detail in “\nDistribution & Sales\n” above, in many of our markets we sell our products to distributors. In 2020, sales to a distributor in the European Union Region and a distributor in the East Asia & Australia Region each amounted to 10 percent or more of our consolidated net revenues. See Item 8, Note 12.\nSegment Reporting\nfor more information.  We believe that none of our business segments is dependent upon a single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.  In some of our markets, particularly in the European Union and in the East Asia & Australia Regions, a loss of a distributor may result in a temporary market disruption.\nEmployees\nOur Workforce\n.\nAt December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 71,000 people worldwide, including full-time, temporary and part-time staff. Our businesses are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees. Generally, these laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business. We engage with legally recognized employee representative bodies and we have collective bargaining agreements in many of the countries in which we operate. In addition, in accordance with European Union requirements, we have established a European Works Council composed of management and elected members of our workforce.  We believe we maintain good relations with our employees and their representative organizations.\nOur Internal Transformation\n. To be successful in our transformation to a smoke-free future, we must continue transforming our culture and ways of working, align our talent with our business needs and innovate to become a truly consumer-centric business.  To achieve our strategic goals, we need to attract, retain and motivate the best global talent with the right degree of diversity, experience and skills.  Therefore, we strive to ensure the development of our existing talent while increasingly recruiting those with the expertise in areas that are new to us such as digital and technical solutions.  We set the levels of our compensation and benefit programs that we believe are necessary to achieve these goals and remain competitive with other consumer product companies.\nOversight and Management\n. Our Board of Directors provides oversight of various matters pertaining to our workforce, and the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Board is responsible for executive compensation matters and oversight of the risks and programs related to talent management. As part of our commitment to workplace diversity in 2020, our Board appointed a Chief Diversity Officer who reports directly to our CEO. Our Code of Conduct highlights our commitment to diversity, inclusion, fairness, safety and equal opportunity in all aspects of employment. We were the first multinational company to receive a global EQUAL-SALARY certification from the EQUAL-SALARY Foundation. This achievement is an important building block on the road to creating a more inclusive gender-balanced workplace and continuing our reputation as a top employer.\nOur Initiatives in Response to COVID-19\n. We focused on business continuity, health and safety of our employees, and rapidly adapting our ways of working to a new environment. We implemented additional safety measures for essential employees in our facilities and offices and continue to pay salaries to those employees who are unable to work due to government restrictions.  We enhanced remote work arrangements and digital collaboration and related risk management, and to date, a large majority of our employees continues to work remotely.\nGovernment Regulation\nAs a company with global operations in a heavily regulated industry, we are subject to multiple laws and regulations of jurisdictions in which we operate.  We discuss our regulatory environment in Item 7,\nBusiness Environment\n.\nWe are subject to international, national and local environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business. We have specific programs across our business units designed to meet applicable environmental compliance requirements and reduce our carbon footprint, wastage, as well as water and energy consumption. We report externally about our climate change mitigation strategy, together with associated targets and results in reducing our carbon footprint, through CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project), the leading international non-governmental organization assessing the work of thousands of companies worldwide in the area of environmental impact, including climate change. Our environmental and occupational health and safety management program includes policies, standard practices and procedures at all our manufacturing centers. Furthermore, we have engaged an external certification body to validate the effectiveness of this management program at our manufacturing centers around the world, in accordance with internationally recognized standards for safety and environmental management. Our subsidiaries expect to continue to\n4\nmake investments in order to drive improved performance and maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations. We assess and report to our management the compliance status of all our legal entities on a regular basis. Based on current regulations, the management and controls we have in place and our review of climate change risks (both physical and regulatory), environmental expenditures have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position, earnings or competitive position.\nBased on current regulations, compliance with government regulations, including environmental regulations, has not had, and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position, earnings, or competitive position.\nAs discussed in more detail in Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\n, our financial results could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives that could result in a significant decrease in demand for our brands. More specifically, any regulatory requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products or impede adult consumers' ability to convert to our RRPs, as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe disclosure regarding executive officers is hereby incorporated by reference to the discussion under the heading “Information about our Executive Officers as of February 8, 2021” in Part III, Item 10.\nDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Item 10”).\nIntellectual Property\nOur trademarks are valuable assets, and their protection and reputation are essential to us. We own the trademark rights to all of our principal brands, including\nMarlboro\n,\nHEETS\nand\nIQOS\n, or have the right to use them in all countries where we use them.\nIn addition, we have a large number of granted patents and pending patent applications worldwide. Our patent portfolio, as a whole, is material to our business. However, no one patent, or group of related patents, is material to us. We also have registered industrial designs, as well as unregistered proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other unregistered intellectual property rights.\nEffective January 1, 2008, PMI entered into an Intellectual Property Agreement with Philip Morris USA Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc. (“PM USA”). The Intellectual Property Agreement allocates ownership of jointly funded intellectual property as follows:\n•\nPMI owns all rights to jointly funded intellectual property outside the United States, its territories and possessions; and\n•\nPM USA owns all rights to jointly funded intellectual property in the United States, its territories and possessions.\nThe parties agreed to submit disputes under the Intellectual Property Agreement first to negotiation between senior executives and then to binding arbitration.\nSeasonality\nOur business segments are not significantly affected by seasonality, although in certain markets cigarette consumption may be lower during the winter months due to the cold weather and may rise during the summer months due to outdoor use, longer daylight, and tourism.\nAvailable Information\nWe are required to file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The SEC maintains an Internet website at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, from which investors can electronically access our SEC filings.\nWe make available free of charge on, or through, our website at www.pmi.com our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of\n5\nthe Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Investors can access our filings with the SEC by visiting www.pmi.com.\nThe information on our website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this report or incorporated into any other filings we make with the SEC."

    "text": "The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operating results, our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\nWe may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC, in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as \"strategy,\" \"expects,\" \"continues,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"will,\" \"estimates,\" \"intends,\" \"projects,\" \"aims,\" \"goals,\" \"targets,\" \"forecasts\" and other words of similar meaning. You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.\nWe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Our RRPs constitute a new product category in its early stages that is less predictable than our mature cigarette business.  Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in Item 7,\nBusiness Environment\n. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time, except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations.\nOverall Business Risks\nConsumption of tax-paid cigarettes continues to decline in many of our markets.\nThis decline is due to multiple factors, including increased taxes and pricing, governmental actions, the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and health concerns, continuing economic and geopolitical uncertainty, and the continuing prevalence of illicit products. These factors and their potential consequences are discussed more fully below and in Item 7,\nBusiness Environment\n.\nCigarettes are subject to substantial taxes. Significant increases in cigarette-related taxes have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted in numerous jurisdictions. These tax increases may disproportionately affect our profitability and make us less competitive versus certain of our competitors.\nTax regimes, including excise taxes, sales taxes and import duties, can disproportionately affect the retail price of cigarettes versus other combustible tobacco products, or disproportionately affect the relative retail price of our cigarette brands versus cigarette brands manufactured by certain of our competitors. Because our portfolio is weighted toward the premium-price cigarette category, tax regimes based on sales price can place us at a competitive disadvantage in certain markets. As a result, our volume and profitability may be adversely affected in these markets.\nIncreases in cigarette taxes are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our sales of cigarettes, due to resulting lower consumption levels, a shift in sales from manufactured cigarettes to other combustible tobacco products and from the premium-price to the mid-price or low-price cigarette categories, where we may be under-represented, from local sales to legal cross-border purchases of lower price products, or to illicit products such as contraband, counterfeit and \"illicit whites.\"\n6\nOur business faces significant governmental action aimed at increasing regulatory requirements with the goal of reducing or preventing the use of tobacco products.\nGovernmental actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private actions to restrict smoking, have resulted in reduced industry volume in many of our markets, and we expect that such factors will continue to reduce consumption levels and will increase down-trading and the risk of counterfeiting, contraband, \"illicit whites\" and legal cross-border purchases. Significant regulatory developments will continue to take place over the next few years in most of our markets, driven principally by the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (\"FCTC\"). Since it came into force in 2005, the FCTC has led to increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and public health organizations to promote increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the marketing and sale of tobacco products to adult smokers. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include:\nOur financial results could be significantly affected by regulatory initiatives resulting in a significant decrease in demand for our brands. More specifically, requirements that lead to a commoditization of tobacco products or impede adult consumers' ability to convert to our RRPs, as well as any significant increase in the cost of complying with new regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nChanges in the earnings mix and changes in tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates. Our ability to receive payments from foreign subsidiaries or to repatriate royalties and dividends could be restricted by local country currency exchange controls and other regulations.\nWe are subject to income tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The results of the 2020 U.S. presidential and congressional elections could lead to changes in the U.S. tax system, including significant increases in the U.S. corporate income tax rate and the minimum tax rate on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries.  If ultimately enacted into law, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate thereby reducing our net earnings.  Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. If implemented, such changes, as well as changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, or positions, could also have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate thereby reducing our net earnings. In future periods, our ability to recover deferred tax assets could be subject to additional uncertainty as a result of such developments. Furthermore, changes in the earnings mix or applicable foreign tax laws may result in significant variability in our effective tax rates.\nBecause we are a U.S. holding company, our most significant source of funds is distributions from our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Certain countries in which we operate have adopted or could institute currency exchange controls and other regulations that limit or prohibit our local subsidiaries' ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars or to make payments outside the country. This could subject us to the risks of local currency devaluation and business disruption.\n7\nRisks Related to our International Operations\nBecause we have operations in numerous countries, our results may be adversely impacted by economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters, pandemics or conflicts.\nSome of the countries in which we operate face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to regime changes. In others, nationalization, terrorism, conflict and the threat of war may have a significant impact on the business environment. Natural disasters, pandemics, economic, political, regulatory or other developments could disrupt our supply chain, manufacturing capabilities or distribution capabilities. In addition, such developments could increase costs of our materials and operations and lead to loss of property or equipment that are critical to our business in certain markets and difficulty in staffing and managing our operations, all of which could reduce our volumes, revenues and net earnings. We discuss risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic below.\nIn certain markets, we are dependent on governmental approvals of various actions such as price changes, and failure to obtain such approvals could impair growth of our profitability.\nIn addition, despite our high ethical standards and rigorous control and compliance procedures aimed at preventing and detecting unlawful conduct, given the breadth and scope of our international operations, we may not be able to detect all potential improper or unlawful conduct by our employees and partners.\nOur reported results could be adversely affected by unfavorable currency exchange rates, and currency devaluations could impair our competitiveness.\nWe conduct our business primarily in local currency and, for purposes of financial reporting, the local currency results are translated into U.S. dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported net revenues, operating income and EPS will be reduced because the local currency translates into fewer U.S. dollars. During periods of economic crises, such as during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, foreign currencies may be devalued significantly against the U.S. dollar, reducing our margins. Actions to recover margins may result in lower volume and a weaker competitive position.\nRisks Related to Legal Challenges and Investigations\nLitigation related to tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could substantially reduce our profitability and could severely impair our liquidity.\nThere is litigation related to tobacco products pending in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Damages claimed in some tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in Brazil, Canada, and Nigeria, range into the billions of U.S. dollars. We anticipate that new cases will continue to be filed. The FCTC encourages litigation against tobacco product manufacturers. It is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. See Item 8, Note 17.\nContingencies\nto our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pending litigation and \"Business Environment—Reduced-Risk Products (RRPs)—Legal Challenges to RRPs.\"\nFrom time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters.\nInvestigations include allegations of contraband shipments of cigarettes, allegations of unlawful pricing activities within certain markets, allegations of underpayment of income taxes, customs duties and/or excise taxes, allegations of false and misleading usage of descriptors, allegations of unlawful advertising, and allegations of unlawful labor practices. We cannot predict the outcome of those investigations or whether additional investigations may be commenced, and it is possible that our business could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of pending or future investigations. See Item 8, Note 17.\nContingencies—Other Litigation\nand “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Operating Results by Business Segment—Business Environment—Governmental Investigations” for a description of certain governmental investigations to which we are subject.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and disputes relating to intellectual property rights could harm our business.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable assets, and their protection is important to our business.  If the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights globally, including through a combination of trademark, design, patent and other intellectual property rights, are inadequate, or if others infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights, notwithstanding legal protection, our business could be adversely impacted. Intellectual property rights of third parties may limit our ability to commercialize our products or improve product quality in one or more markets. Competitors or other third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights. Any such claims, regardless of merit, could divert management’s attention, be costly, disruptive, time-consuming and unpredictable and expose us to litigation costs and damages, and impede our ability to manufacture, commercialize and improve our products. If, as a result, we are unable to manufacture or sell our RRPs or improve their quality in one or more markets, our ability to\n8\nconvert adult smokers to our RRPs in such markets would be adversely affected. See Item 8, Note 17.\nContingencies—Other Litigation\nto our condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of certain intellectual property proceedings.\nRisks Related to our Competitive Environment\nWe face intense competition, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nWe are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products, higher tobacco product taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products and restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our RRPs. Competitors include three large international tobacco companies, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and local tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, the PRC, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Industry consolidation and privatizations of state-owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in competitive pressures. Some competitors have different profit and volume objectives, and some international competitors are susceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates. Certain new market entrants may alienate consumers from innovative products through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior product satisfaction, while not relying on scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our RRPs.\nWe may be unable to anticipate changes in adult consumer preferences.\nOur business is subject to changes in adult consumer preferences, which may be influenced by local economic conditions.\nTo be successful, we must:\nIn periods of economic uncertainty, adult consumers may tend to purchase lower-price brands, and the volume of our premium-price and mid-price brands and our profitability could be materially adversely impacted as a result. Such down-trading trends may be reinforced by regulation that limits branding, communication and product differentiation.\nOur ability to grow profitability may be limited by our inability to introduce new products, enter new markets or improve our margins through higher pricing and improvements in our brand and geographic mix.\nOur profit growth may be adversely impacted if we are unable to introduce new products or enter new markets successfully, to raise prices or to improve the proportion of our sales of higher margin products and in higher margin geographies.\nWe may be unable to expand our brand portfolio through successful acquisitions or the development of strategic business relationships.\nOne element of our growth strategy is to strengthen our brand portfolio and market positions through selective acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships. Acquisition and strategic business development opportunities are limited and present risks of failing to achieve efficient and effective integration, strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire attractive businesses on favorable terms, or that future acquisitions or strategic business developments will be accretive to earnings.\n9\nOur ability to achieve our strategic goals may be impaired if we fail to attract, motivate and retain the best global talent and effectively align our organizational design with the goals of our transformation.\nTo be successful, we must continue transforming our culture and ways of working, align our talent and organizational design with our increasingly complex business needs, and innovate and transform to a consumer-centric business. We compete for talent, including in areas that are new to us, such as digital and technical solutions, with companies in the consumer products, technology and other sectors that enjoy greater societal acceptance. As a result, we may be unable to attract, motivate and retain the best global talent with the right degree of diversity, experience and skills to achieve our strategic goals.\nRisks Related to the Impact of COVID-19 on our Business\nOur business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position will be adversely impacted during the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant societal and economic disruption, and resulted in closures of stores, factories and offices, and restrictions on manufacturing, distribution and travel, all of which have and will continue to adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position while the pandemic continues. Our business continuity plans and other safeguards may not be effective to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.\nCurrently, significant risks include our diminished ability to convert adult smokers to our RRPs, significant volume declines in our duty-free business and certain other key markets, disruptions or delays in our manufacturing and supply chain, increased currency volatility, and delays in certain cost saving, transformation and restructuring initiatives. Our business could also be adversely impacted if key personnel or a significant number of employees or business partners become unavailable due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The significant adverse impact of COVID-19 on the economic or political conditions in markets in which we operate could result in changes to the preferences of our adult consumers and lower demand for our products, particularly for our mid-price or premium-price brands. Continuation of the pandemic could disrupt our access to the credit markets or increase our borrowing costs. Governments may temporarily be unable to focus on the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business. In addition, messaging about the potential negative impacts of the use of our products on COVID-19 risks may lead to increasingly restrictive regulatory measures on the sale and use of our products, negatively impact demand for our products and the willingness of adult consumers to switch to our RRPs, and adversely impact our efforts to advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs.\nThe impact of these risks also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in general and specifically in the jurisdictions in which we operate, its recurrence in our key markets, actions taken to contain its spread and to mitigate its public health effects, and the ultimate economic consequences thereof.\nRisks Related to Sourcing of Materials, Products and Services\nUse of third-party resources may negatively impact quality of our products and services, and we may be required to replace third-party contract manufacturers or service providers with our own resources.\nWe increasingly rely on third-party resources to manufacture some of our products and product parts (particularly, the electronic devices and accessories) and to provide services, including to support our finance and information technology processes. While many of these arrangements improve efficiencies and decrease our operating costs, they also diminish our direct control.  Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality of products or services, our supply chain, and the speed and flexibility in our response to changing market conditions and adult consumer preferences, all of which may place us at a competitive disadvantage.   In addition, we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons, including government regulations, and our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with our own resources.\nGovernment mandated prices, production control programs, shifts in crops driven by economic conditions and the impact of climate change may increase the cost or reduce the quality of the tobacco and other agricultural products used to manufacture our products.\nAs with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf and cloves can be influenced by imbalances in supply and demand and the impacts of natural disasters and pandemics such as COVID-19. Furthermore, crop quality may be influenced by variations in weather patterns, including those caused by climate change. Tobacco production in certain countries is subject to a variety of controls, including government mandated prices and production control programs. Changes in the patterns of demand for agricultural products could cause farmers to produce less tobacco or cloves. Any significant change in tobacco leaf and clove prices, quality and quantity could affect our profitability and our business.\n10\nRisks Related to the Success of our Reduced-Risk Products\nThe financial and business performance of our reduced-risk products is less predictable than our cigarette business.\nOur RRPs are novel products in a new category, and the pace at which adult smokers adopt them may vary, depending on the competitive, regulatory, fiscal and cultural environment, and other factors in a specific market. There may be periods of accelerated growth and periods of slower growth for these products, the timing and drivers of which may be more difficult for us to predict versus our mature cigarette business. The impact of this lower predictability on our projected results for a specific period may be significant, particularly during the early stages of this new product category and during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our attempts to introduce reduced-risk products, and regulators may not permit the commercialization of these products or the communication of scientifically substantiated information and claims.\nOur key strategic priorities are: to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking; and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those RRPs. For our efforts to be successful, we must:\nWe might not succeed in our efforts. If we do not succeed, but others do, or if heat-not-burn products are inequitably regulated compared to other RRP categories without regard to the totality of the scientific evidence available for such products, we may be at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, actions of some market entrants, such as the inappropriate marketing of e-vapor products to youth, as well as alleged health consequences associated with the use of certain e-vapor products, may unfavorably impact public opinion and/or mischaracterize all e-vapor products or other RRPs to consumers, regulators and policy makers without regard to the totality of scientific evidence for specific products. This may impede our efforts to advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs. We cannot predict whether regulators will permit the sale and/or marketing of RRPs with scientifically substantiated information and claims. Such restrictions could limit the success of our RRPs.\nOur RRPs and commercial activities for these products are designed for, and directed toward, current adult smokers and users of nicotine-containing products, and not for non-smokers or youth. If nonetheless there is a significant usage of our products or competitive products among youth or non-smokers, even in situations over which we have no control, our credibility may suffer, and our efforts to advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the commercialization of RRPs may be significantly impacted.\nMoreover, the FDA’s premarket tobacco product and modified risk tobacco product authorizations of a version of our Platform 1 product are subject to strict marketing, reporting and other requirements. Although we have received these product authorizations from the FDA, there is no guarantee that the product will remain authorized, particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth or non-smoker initiation.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our efforts to differentiate reduced-risk products and cigarettes with respect to taxation.\nTo date, we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our RRPs are not cigarettes due to the absence of combustion, and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products, which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes. If we cease to be successful in these efforts, RRP unit margins may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Illicit Trade\nWe lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband, cross-border purchases, \"illicit whites,\" non-tax-paid volume produced by local manufacturers, and counterfeiting of our Platform 1 device and heated tobacco units.\nLarge quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market. We believe that\nMarlboro\nis the most heavily counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity. In addition, our revenues are reduced by contraband, legal cross-border purchases, \"illicit whites\" and non-tax-paid volume produced by local\n11\nmanufacturers. Our revenues and consumer satisfaction with our Platform 1 device and heated tobacco units may be adversely affected by counterfeit products that do not meet our product quality standards and scientific validation procedures.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Governance\nThe failure of our information systems to function as intended or their penetration with the intent to corrupt them or our failure to adhere to strict data governance and cybersecurity protocols and to comply with privacy laws and regulations could result in business disruption, loss of reputation, litigation and regulatory action, and loss of revenue, assets or personal or other confidential data.\nWe use information systems to help manage business processes, collect and interpret data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, consumers, customers and others. Some of these information systems are managed by third-party service providers. We have backup systems and business continuity plans in place, and we work with our internal specialists and these third-party service providers to protect these systems and data from unauthorized access. Nevertheless, failure of these systems to function as intended, or penetration of these systems by parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or otherwise disrupting business processes, could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in a loss of revenue, assets or personal or other sensitive data, litigation and regulatory action, cause damage to our reputation and that of our brands and result in significant remediation and other costs. Failure to protect personal data, respect the rights of data subjects, and adhere to strict data governance and cybersecurity protocols could subject us to substantial fines and other legal challenges under regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation. As we are increasingly relying on digital platforms in our business, and as privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business become more stringent, the magnitude of these risks is likely to increase."

We are a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, as well as smoke-free products, associated electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the United States.  In addition, we ship versions of our Platform 1 device and consumables to Altria Group, Inc. for sale under license in the United States, where these products have received marketing authorizations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") under the premarket tobacco product application (\"PMTA\") pathway; the FDA has also authorized the marketing of a version of our Platform 1 device and its consumables as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\"), finding that an exposure modification order for these products is appropriate to promote the public health.  We are building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while not risk-free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke.  Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, we aim to ensure that our smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements.  Our smoke-free product portfolio includes heat-not-burn and nicotine-containing vapor products.\nWe manage our business in six operating segments:\n•\nEuropean Union (\"EU\");\n•\nEastern Europe (\"EE\");\n•\nMiddle East & Africa (\"ME&A\"), which includes our international duty free business;\n•\nSouth & Southeast Asia (\"S&SA\");\n16\n•\nEast Asia & Australia (\"EA&A\"); and\n•\nLatin America & Canada (\"LA&C\"), which includes transactions under license with Altria Group, Inc. for the distribution of our Platform 1 product in the United States.\nOur cigarettes are sold in more than 175 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position.  We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands.  Our\nportfolio comprises both international and local brands.  In addition to the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, we are engaged in the development and commercialization of reduced-risk products (\"RRPs\").  RRPs is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continuing smoking.\nWe use the term net revenues to refer to our operating revenues from the sale of our products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes.  Our net revenues and operating income are affected by various factors, including the volume of products we sell, the price of our products, changes in currency exchange rates and the mix of products we sell.  Mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium-price brands to mid-price or low-price brands in any given market (product mix).  Mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets versus shipment volume in less profitable markets (geographic mix).\nOur cost of sales consists principally of: tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs; shipping and handling costs; and the cost of devices produced by third-party electronics manufacturing service providers.  Estimated costs associated with device warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.\nOur marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products.  The most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses.\nPhilip Morris International Inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from its direct and indirect subsidiaries.  Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized.  As a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions that are otherwise compliant with law.\n18\nExecutive Summary\nThe following executive summary provides the business update and significant highlights from the\nDiscussion and Analysis\nthat follows.\nConsolidated Operating Results\n•\nNet Revenues –\nNet revenues of $28.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by $1.1 billion, or 3.7%, from the comparable 2019 amount, and were impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the second quarter of 2020 and continuing throughout the second half of the year.  The change in our net revenues from the comparable 2019 amount was driven by the following (variances not to scale):\nNet revenues, excluding unfavorable currency, decreased by 2.2%, reflecting: unfavorable volume/mix, primarily due to lower cigarette volume (mainly in Argentina, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, PMI Duty Free, Poland, Russia and Ukraine, partly offset by Germany), partially offset by higher heated tobacco unit volume (notably in the EU, Japan, Russia and Ukraine, partly offset by PMI Duty Free); and the unfavorable impact of $253 million, shown in \"Cost/Other,\" mainly resulting from the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary, Rothman, Benson & Hedges, Inc. (\"RBH\"), effective March 22, 2019, and lower fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets; partly offset by a favorable pricing variance (notably driven by the Gulf Cooperation Council, Germany, Japan, Mexico, North Africa, the Philippines, PMI Duty Free, Russia and Ukraine, partially offset by Indonesia, Poland and Turkey).  For further details on the deconsolidation of RBH, see Item 8, Note 17.\nContingencies\nand Note 20.\nDeconsolidation of RBH.\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council (\"GCC\") is defined as Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n19\nNet revenues by product category for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, are shown below:\n•\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\n–\nThe changes in our reported diluted earnings per share (“diluted EPS”) for the year ended December 31, 2020, from the comparable 2019 amounts, were as follows:\nAsset impairment and exit costs –\nDuring 2019, as part of the optimization of our global manufacturing infrastructure, we recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $422 million, representing $362 million net of income tax and a diluted EPS charge of $0.23 per share.  This 2019 charge primarily related to a cigarette plant closure in Berlin, Germany (approximately $0.19 per share), as well as the closure of cigarette plants in Argentina, Colombia and Pakistan.  During 2020, we recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of\n$149 million, representing $124 million net of income tax and a diluted EPS charge of\n20\n$0.08 per share, related to the organizational design optimization plan, primarily in Switzerland.  The total pre-tax charges in 2019 and 2020 were included in marketing, administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 19.\nAsset Impairment and Exit Costs\n.\nCanadian tobacco litigation-related expense\n–\nIn the first quarter of 2019, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $194 million, representing $142 million net of tax, relating to the judgment against RBH in two Québec smoking and health class actions.  The charge of $0.09 per share reflects our assessment of the portion of the judgment that represents a probable and estimable loss prior to the deconsolidation of RBH and corresponds to the trust account deposit required by the judgment.  The total pre-tax charge was included in marketing, administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings and was included in the operating income of the Latin America & Canada segment.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 17.\nContingencies\nand Item 8, Note 20.\nDeconsolidation of RBH\n.\nLoss on deconsolidation of RBH\n–\nFollowing the judgment in the two Québec smoking and health class actions, RBH obtained an initial order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting it protection under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (“CCAA”), which is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers, suppliers and employees.  The administration of the CCAA process, principally relating to the powers provided to the court and the court appointed monitor, removes certain elements of control of the business from both PMI and RBH.  As a result, we have determined that we no longer have a controlling financial interest over RBH and that we do not exert \"significant influence\" over RBH under U.S. GAAP.  Therefore, we deconsolidated RBH as of the date of the CCAA filing on March 22, 2019, and have accounted for our continuing investment in RBH as an equity security, without readily determinable fair value.\nA loss on the deconsolidation of RBH of $239 million was included in marketing, administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019, and was included in the operating income of the Latin America & Canada segment.  The $0.12 per share impact also included a tax benefit of $49 million within the provision for income taxes, as discussed below, related to the reversal of a deferred tax liability on the unremitted earnings of RBH.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 17.\nContingencies\nand Item 8, Note 20.\nDeconsolidation of RBH\n.\nRussia excise and VAT audit charge –\nAs a result of the final tax assessment for the 2015-2017 financial years received by our Russian affiliate, in the third quarter of 2019, PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $374 million in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings, representing $315 million net of income tax and a diluted EPS charge of $0.20. The pre-tax charge of $374 million was included in the operating income of the Eastern Europe segment. For further details, see Item 8, Note 17.\nContingencies.\nBrazil indirect tax credit -\nFollowing a final and enforceable decision by the highest court in Brazil in October 2020, PMI recorded a gain of $119 million for tax credits ($79 million net of income tax and $0.05 per share increase in diluted EPS) representing overpayments of indirect taxes for the period from March 2012 through December 2019; these tax credits will be applied to future tax liabilities in Brazil.  This amount was included as a reduction in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020 and was included in the operating income of the Latin America & Canada segment.  A decision regarding an additional amount of overpaid indirect taxes of approximately $90 million is still pending before this court.\nFair Value adjustment for equity security investments –\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, PMI recorded a favorable fair value adjustment for its equity security investments of $35 million after tax (or $0.02 per share increase in diluted EPS).  The fair value adjustment for its equity security investments was included in equity investments and securities (income)/loss, net ($44 million income) and provision for income taxes ($9 million expense) on the consolidated statements of earnings in 2019.  During 2020, we recorded an unfavorable fair value adjustment for our equity security investments of $60 million after tax (or $0.04 per share decrease in diluted EPS).  The fair value adjustment for our equity security investments was included in equity investments and securities (income)/loss, net ($76 million loss) and provision for income taxes ($16 million benefit) on the consolidated statements of earnings.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 4.\nRelated Parties - Equity Investments and Other.\nIncome taxes –\nThe 2019 Tax items that increased our 2019 diluted EPS by $0.04 per share in the table above were primarily due to a reduction in estimated U.S. federal income tax on dividend repatriation for the years 2015 - 2018 ($67 million).  The 2020 Tax items that increased our 2020 diluted EPS by $0.06 per share in the table above were due to final U.S. tax regulations under the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\"GILTI\") provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for years 2018 and 2019 ($93 million).  For further details, see Item 8, Note 11.\nIncome Taxes\n.\nThe change in the tax rate that increased our diluted EPS by $0.05 per share in the table above was primarily due to changes in earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction, a reduction of U.S. state tax expense and the corporate income tax rate reduction in Indonesia,\n21\npartially offset by a decrease in deductions related to foreign-derived intangible income for the years 2018 and 2019 and repatriation cost differences.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 11.\nIncome Taxes\n.\nCurrency\n– The unfavorable currency impact during 2020 results from the fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, especially against the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Indonesian rupiah, Mexican peso, Russian ruble, Swiss franc and Turkish lira, partially offset by the Egyptian pound, Japanese yen and Philippine peso.  This unfavorable currency movement has impacted our profitability across our primary revenue markets and local currency cost bases.\nInterest\n– The unfavorable impact of interest was due primarily to lower interest earned on cash balances.\nOperations\n– The increase in diluted EPS of $0.27 from our operations in the table above was due primarily to the following segments:\n•\nEuropean Union: Favorable volume/mix, favorable pricing and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs;\n•\nEast Asia & Australia: Lower marketing, administration and research costs, lower manufacturing costs and favorable pricing, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix; and\n•\nEastern Europe: Favorable pricing, favorable volume/mix and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs ;\npartially offset by\n•\nMiddle East & Africa: Unfavorable volume/mix and lower fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets, partially offset by favorable pricing,  and lower marketing, administration and research costs;\n•\nSouth & Southeast Asia: Unfavorable volume/mix and unfavorable pricing, partially offset by lower marketing, administration and research costs; and\n•\nLatin America & Canada: Unfavorable volume/mix, as well as the unfavorable impact resulting from the deconsolidation of RBH, partially offset by favorable pricing and lower marketing, administration and research costs.\nFor further details, see the\nConsolidated Operating Results\nand\nOperating Results by Business Segment\nsections of the following\nDiscussion and Analysis\n.\nCOVID-19 Impact on Our Business\nCOVID-19: Business Continuity Update\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, PMI has undertaken a number of business continuity measures to mitigate potential disruption to its operations and route-to-market in order to preserve the availability of products to its customers and adult consumers.\nCurrently:\n•\nPMI has sufficient access to the inputs for its products and is not facing any significant business continuity issues with respect to key suppliers;\n•\nAll of of PMI's cigarette and heated tobacco unit manufacturing facilities globally are operational;\n•\nCOVID-related restrictions do not have a significant impact on the availability of PMI's products to its customers and adult consumers; and\n•\nPMI has sufficient liquidity resources through cash on hand, the ongoing cash generation of its business, and its access to the commercial paper and debt markets.\nNonetheless, significant uncertainty remains as the spread of the disease is increasing in a number of markets, resulting in additional restrictions and increasing risk of disruptions.\n22\nDiscussion and Analysis\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nItem 8, Note 2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nto our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. In most instances, we must use a particular accounting policy or method because it is the only one that is permitted under U.S. GAAP.\nThe preparation of financial statements requires that we use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, net revenues and expenses, as well as our disclosure of contingencies. If actual amounts differ from previous estimates, we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period during which we know the actual amounts. Historically, aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our Audit Committee. The following is a discussion of the more significant assumptions, estimates, accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nRevenue Recognition -\nWe recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied.  Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of cigarettes and other nicotine-containing products, including reduced-risk products.  Our performance obligations are typically satisfied upon shipment or delivery to our customers.  The company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience, and these estimates are immaterial.  Estimated costs associated with warranty programs for\nIQOS\ndevices are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized, based on a number of factors, including historical experience, product failure rates and warranty policies.  The transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration where applicable.  Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers, historical experience of discount or rebate redemption, where relevant, and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs, which may change from time to time as the business and product categories evolve.\nInventories -\nOur inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.  The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory.  We perform regular reviews of our inventory on hand, as well as our future purchase commitments with our suppliers, considering multiple factors, including demand forecasts, product life cycle, current sales levels, pricing strategy and cost trends.  If our review indicates that inventories of raw materials, components or finished products have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or that inventory cost exceeds net realizable value, we may be required to make adjustments that will impact the results of operations.\nGoodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets Valuation -\nWe test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review.  While the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis.  The impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired. To determine the fair value of goodwill, we primarily use the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global companies within the tobacco industry, supported by a discounted cash flow model.  At December 31, 2020, the carrying value of our goodwill was $6.0 billion, which is related to ten reporting units, each of which consists of a group of markets with similar operating and economic characteristics.  The estimated fair value of each of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of December 31, 2020.  To determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets, we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method. We concluded that the fair value of our non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value.\nThese discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows, which are subject to changes in business conditions, such as volumes and prices, costs to produce, discount rates and estimated capital needs. Management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated, and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use.  Since the March 28, 2008, spin-off from Altria Group, Inc., we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets.\nMarketing Costs -\nWe incur certain costs to support our products through programs that include advertising, marketing, consumer engagement and trade promotions.  The costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the\n23\njudgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program.   For volume-based incentives provided to customers, management continually assesses and estimates, by customer, the likelihood of the customer's achieving the specified targets, and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made.  For other trade promotions, management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience.  Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position, results of operations or operating cash flows.\nEmployee Benefit Plans -\nAs discussed in Item 8, Note 13.\nBenefit Plans\nto our consolidated financial statements, we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits (primarily severance). We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by U.S. GAAP. These calculations include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, compensation increases, mortality, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries.\nWeighted-average discount rate assumptions for pension and postretirement plan obligations at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nWe anticipate that assumption changes will increase 2021 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense to approximately $300 million as compared with approximately $264 million in 2020, excluding amounts related to employee severance and early retirement programs. The anticipated increase is primarily due to higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains/losses of $50 million, coupled with higher service cost of $24 million, partially offset by lower interest cost of $18 million and higher expected return on plan assets of $17 million and other movements of $3 million.\nWeighted-average expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans.  A fifty-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2021 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $80 million, and a fifty-basis-point increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2021 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $70 million. Similarly, a fifty-basis-point decrease (increase) in the expected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) our 2021 pension expense by approximately $40 million.\nIncome Taxes -\nIncome tax provisions for jurisdictions outside the United States, as well as state and local income tax provisions, are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe extent of our operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes, we evaluate potential tax exposures and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.  We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.  If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.\nWe are required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income.  If we determine, using all available evidence, that we do not reach the more likely than not threshold for recovery, a valuation allowance is recorded.  Significant judgment is required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets including estimates of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions and the feasibility of on-going tax planning strategies, as applicable.\nThe effective tax rates used for interim reporting are based on our full-year geographic earnings mix projections.  Changes in currency exchange rates, earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction or future regulatory developments may have an impact on the effective tax rates.  Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.\n24\nFor further details, see Item 8, Note 11.\nIncome Taxes\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nHedging -\nAs discussed below in “Market Risk,” we use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures. For derivatives to which we have elected to apply hedge accounting, gains and losses on these derivatives are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive losses on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings into the same line item as the impact of the underlying transaction and in the periods when the related hedged transactions are also recognized in operating results. If we had elected not to use the hedge accounting provisions, gains (losses) deferred in stockholders’ (deficit) equity would have been recorded in our net earnings for these derivatives.\nFair value of non-marketable equity securities -\nFor further details, see Item 8, Note 20.\nDeconsolidation of RBH.\nContingencies -\nAs\ndiscussed in Item 8, Note 17.\nContingencies\nto our consolidated financial statements, legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us, and/or our subsidiaries, and/or our indemnitees in various jurisdictions. We and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. Much of the tobacco-related litigation is in its early stages, and litigation is subject to uncertainty. At the present time, except as stated otherwise in Item 8, Note 17.\nContingencies,\nwhile it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, after assessing the information available to it: (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.\nConsolidated Operating Results\nOur net revenues and operating income by segment were as follows:\n(1)\nAs of March 22, 2019, PMI deconsolidated the financial results of its Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (\"RBH\") from PMI's financial statements.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 20.\nDeconsolidation of RBH\n.\n25\nItems affecting the comparability of results from operations were as follows:\n•\nAsset impairment and exit costs\n- See Item 8, Note 19.\nAsset Impairment and Exit Costs\nfor details of the $149 million and $422 million pre-tax charges for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as well as a breakdown of these costs by segment.\n•\nRussia excise and VAT audit charge\n- See Item 8, Note 17.\nContingencies\nfor details of the $374 million pre-tax charge included in the Eastern Europe segment for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n•\nCanadian tobacco litigation-related expense\n- See Item 8, Note 17.\nContingencies\nand Note 20.\nDeconsolidation of RBH\nfor details of the $194 million pre-tax charge included in the Latin America & Canada segment for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n•\nLoss on deconsolidation of RBH\n- See Item 8, Note 20.\nDeconsolidation of RBH\nfor details of the $239 million loss included in the Latin America & Canada segment for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n•\nBrazil indirect tax credit\n- Following a final and enforceable decision by the highest court in Brazil in October 2020, PMI recorded a gain of $119 million for tax credits representing overpayments of indirect taxes for the period from March 2012 through December 2019; these tax credits will be applied to future tax liabilities in Brazil.  This amount was included as a reduction in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020 and was included in the operating income of the Latin America & Canada segment.  A decision regarding an additional amount of overpaid indirect taxes of approximately $90 million is still pending before this court.\nOur net revenues by product category were as follows:\nNote: Sum of product categories or Regions might not foot to total PMI due to rounding.\nNet revenues related to combustible products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes.  These net revenue amounts consist of the sale of our cigarettes and other tobacco products combined.  Other tobacco products primarily include roll-your-own and make-your-own cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and cigarillos and do not include reduced-risk products.\nNet revenues related to reduced-risk products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes.  These net revenue\n26\namounts consist of the sale of our heated tobacco units, heat-not-burn devices and related accessories, and other nicotine-containing products, which primarily include our e-vapor products.\nPMI's heat-not-burn products include licensed KT&G heat-not-burn products.\nRevenues from shipments of Platform 1 devices, heated tobacco units and accessories to Altria Group, Inc., commencing in the third quarter of 2019, for sale under license in the United States, are included in Net Revenues of the Latin America & Canada segment.\nReferences to \"Cost/Other\" in the Consolidated Financial Summary table of total PMI and the six operating segments throughout this\n\"Discussion and Analysis\"\nreflects the currency-neutral variances of: cost of sales (excluding the volume/mix cost component); marketing, administration and research costs (including asset impairment and exit costs, the Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense, the charge related to the deconsolidation of RBH in Canada, and the Russia excise and VAT audit charge); and amortization of intangibles.  “Cost/Other” also includes the currency-neutral net revenue variance, unrelated to volume/mix and price components, attributable to fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets in the ME&A Region, as well as the impact of the deconsolidation in RBH.\nOur shipment volume by segment for cigarettes and heated tobacco units was as follows:\n(1)\nIncludes shipments to Altria Group, Inc., commencing in the third quarter of 2019, for sale in the United States under license.\nFollowing the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary, we will continue to report the volume of brands sold by RBH for which other PMI subsidiaries are the trademark owners.  These include\nHEETS\n,\nNext\n,\nPhilip Morris\nand\nRooftop.\n27\nHeated tobacco units (\"HTU\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which for us include our\nHEETS\n,\nHEETS Creations, HEETS Dimensions, HEETS Marlboro\nand\nHEETS FROM MARLBORO (\ndefined collectively as\nHEETS)\n,\nMarlboro\nDimensions\n,\nMarlboro\nHeatSticks\nand\nParliament HeatSticks,\nas well as the KT&G-licensed brands,\nFiit\nand\nMiix\n(outside of Korea).\nMarket share for HTUs is defined as the total sales volume for HTUs as a percentage of the total estimated sales volume for cigarettes and HTUs.\nShipment volume of heated tobacco units to the United States is included in the heated tobacco unit shipment volume of the Latin America & Canada segment.\nReferences to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the United States, total industry, total market and market shares throughout this\n\"Discussion and Analysis\"\nare our estimates for tax-paid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources and may, in defined instances, exclude the People's Republic of China and/or our duty free business.  In addition, to reflect the deconsolidation of RBH, effective March 22, 2019, PMI's total market share has been restated for previous periods.\n2020 estimates for total industry volume and market share in certain geographies reflect limitations on the availability and accuracy of industry data during pandemic-related restrictions.\nIn-market sales (\"IMS\") is defined as sales to the retail channel, depending on the market and distribution model.\nNorth Africa is defined as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia.\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council (\"GCC\") is defined as Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\nUnless otherwise stated, references to total industry, total market, our shipment volume and our market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units.\nFrom time to time, PMI’s shipment volumes are subject to the impact of distributor inventory movements, and estimated total industry/market volumes are subject to the impact of inventory movements in various trade channels that include estimated trade inventory movements of PMI’s competitors arising from market-specific factors that significantly distort reported volume disclosures.  Such factors may include changes to the manufacturing supply chain, shipment methods, consumer demand, timing of excise tax increases or other influences that may affect the timing of sales to customers.  In such instances, in addition to reviewing PMI shipment volumes and certain estimated total industry/market volumes on a reported basis, management reviews these measures on an adjusted basis that excludes the impact of distributor and/or estimated trade inventory movements.  Management also believes that disclosing PMI shipment volumes and estimated total industry/market volumes in such circumstances on a basis that excludes the impact of distributor and/or estimated trade inventory movements improves the comparability of performance and trends for these measures over different reporting periods.\n2020 compared with 2019\nThe following discussion compares our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020, with the year ended December 31, 2019.\nEstimated international industry cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume, excluding China and the United States, of 2.5 trillion, decreased by 5.8%, due to all PMI Regions, as described in the Regional sections below.\nOur total shipment volume decreased by 8.1%, due to:\n•\nthe EU, reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume, notably in Italy, Poland and Spain, partly offset by higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume across the Region, particularly in Italy and Poland;\n•\nMiddle East & Africa, reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume, primarily in PMI Duty Free and Turkey, as well as lower heated tobacco unit shipment volume due to PMI Duty Free;\n•\nSouth & Southeast Asia, reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume, primarily in Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines;\n28\n•\nEast Asia & Australia, reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume, predominantly in Japan, partly offset by higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume driven by Japan; and\n•\nLatin America & Canada, reflecting lower cigarette shipment volume, primarily in Argentina and Mexico, partially offset by Brazil. Excluding the volume impact from the RBH deconsolidation, our total shipment volume in the Region decreased by 10.3%;\npartly offset by\n•\nEastern Europe, reflecting higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume across the Region, notably in Russia and Ukraine, partly offset by lower cigarette shipment volume, mainly in Russia and Ukraine.\nExcluding the volume impact from the RBH deconsolidation of approximately 1.0 billion units (reflecting first quarter 2019 volume of RBH-owned brands and including Duty-Free sales of these brands in Canada), PMI's total shipment volume decreased by 7.9%.\nImpact of Inventory Movements\nThe net impact of estimated distributor inventory movements for the full year was immaterial. Excluding the volume impact from the deconsolidation of RBH, our total in-market sales declined by 7.8%.\nOur cigarette shipment volume by brand and heated tobacco unit shipment volume was as follows:\n(1)\nIncludes shipments to Altria Group, Inc., commencing in the third quarter of 2019, for sale in the United States under license.\nNote:\nSampoerna A\nincludes\nSampoerna\n;\nPhilip Morris\nincludes\nPhilip Morris/Dubliss\n;\nLark\nincludes\nLark Harmony; and Next includes Next/Dubliss\nOur cigarette shipment volume of the following brands decreased:\n•\nMarlboro,\nmainly due to Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, PMI Duty Free, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, partly offset by Russia;\n•\nL&M\n, notably due to PMI Duty Free and Poland, partly offset by Mexico and Turkey;\n•\nChesterfield\n, mainly due to Poland, Russia and Turkey, partly offset by Brazil and Saudi Arabia;\n•\nPhilip Morris\n, primarily due to Argentina and Italy, partly offset by Russia;\n•\nParliament\n, mainly due to PMI Duty Free, Russia and Turkey;\n•\nSampoerna A\nin Indonesia, mainly due to premium\nA Mild\n;\n29\n•\nDji Sam Soe\nin Indonesia, mainly due to\nDji Sam Soe Magnum Mild\n;\n•\nBond Street\n, largely due to Russia and Ukraine;\n•\nLark\n, primarily due to Japan and Turkey; and\n•\n\"Others,\" notably due to: the impact of the deconsolidation of RBH in Canada; mid-price\nFortune\nand\nHope\nin the Philippines,\nMuratti\nin Turkey and\nSampoerna U\nin Indonesia; and low-price\nBaronet\n(morphed to\nL&M\n) in Mexico,\nJackpot\nin the Philippines and\nMorven\nin Pakistan; partly offset by mid-price\nSampoerna Hijau\nin Indonesia.\nOur cigarette shipment volume of the following brand increased:\n•\nNext\n, notably driven by Israel and Russia.\nThe increase in our heated tobacco unit shipment volume was mainly driven by the EU (notably Italy and Poland), Eastern Europe (notably Russia and Ukraine) and Japan, partly offset by PMI Duty Free.\n2020 International Share of Market (excluding China and the United States)\nOur total international market share (excluding China and the U.S.), defined as our cigarette and heated tobacco unit sales volume as a percentage of total industry cigarette and heated tobacco unit sales volume, decreased by 0.7 points to 27.7%, reflecting:\n•\nTotal international market share for cigarettes of 24.7%, down by 1.5 points; and\n•\nTotal international market share for heated tobacco units of 3.0%, up by 0.8 points.\nOur total international cigarette sales volume as a percentage of total industry cigarette sales volume was down by 1.2 points to 25.7%, mainly reflecting: out-switching to heated tobacco units, as well as lower cigarette market share and/or an unfavorable geographic mix impact, notably in Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines and PMI Duty Free, partly offset by Brazil and Germany.\nIn 2020, we owned five of the world's top 15 international cigarette brands, with international cigarette market shares as follows:\nMarlboro\n, 9.5%;\nL&M\n, 3.7%;\nChesterfield\n, 2.2%;\nPhilip Morris\n, 1.9%; and\nParliament\n, 1.4%.\n30\nKey Market Data\nKey market data regarding total market size, our shipments and market share were as follows:\n31\n(1)\nCost/Other variance includes the impact of the RBH deconsolidation.\n(2)\nFavorable Cost/Other variance includes the 2019 Russia excise and VAT audit charge of $374 million, the 2019 Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense of $194 million, the 2019 loss on deconsolidation of RBH of $239 million, the 2019 asset impairment and exit costs of $422 million,  the 2020 asset impairment and exit costs of ($149 million) and the 2020 Brazil indirect tax credit of $119 million, as well as the impact of the RBH deconsolidation.\nNote: Net Revenues include revenues from shipments of Platform 1 devices, heated tobacco units and accessories to Altria Group, Inc., commencing in the third quarter of 2019, for sale under license in the United States.\nNet revenues, excluding unfavorable currency, decreased by 2.2%, reflecting: unfavorable volume/mix, primarily due to lower cigarette volume (mainly in Argentina, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, PMI Duty Free, Poland, Russia and Ukraine, partly offset by Germany), partially offset by higher heated tobacco unit volume (notably in the EU, Japan, Russia and Ukraine, partly offset by PMI Duty Free); and the unfavorable impact of $253 million, shown in \"Cost/Other,\" mainly resulting from the deconsolidation of RBH and lower fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets; partly offset by a favorable pricing variance (notably driven by the GCC, Germany, Japan, Mexico, North Africa, the Philippines, PMI Duty Free, Russia and Ukraine, partially offset by Indonesia, Poland and Turkey).\nThe unfavorable currency in net revenues was due primarily to the Brazilian real, Indonesian rupiah, Mexican pesos, Russian ruble and Turkish lira, partially offset by the Euro, Japanese yen and Philippine peso.\nNet revenues include $6.8 billion in 2020 and $5.6 billion in 2019 related to the sale of RRPs.\nIQOS\ndevices accounted for approximately 7% of RRP net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, mainly due to a naturally lower ratio of new users to existing users, longer replacement cycles and geographic mix.\nOperating income, excluding unfavorable currency, increased by 15.3%, notably reflecting a favorable comparison, shown in \"Cost/Other,\" of a net charge of $30 million recorded in 2020 related to asset impairment and exit costs of $149 million (associated with organizational design optimization) and the Brazil indirect tax credit of $119 million, to charges recorded in 2019 of $1.2 billion, related to: asset impairment and exit costs ($422 million), associated with plant closures in Argentina, Colombia, Germany and Pakistan), the loss on the deconsolidation of RBH ($239 million), the Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense ($194 million), and the Russia excise and VAT audit charge ($374 million).\nExcluding these 2020 and 2019 items noted above, and unfavorable currency of $475 million, operating income increased by 3.5%, primarily reflecting: a favorable pricing variance; lower manufacturing costs (driven by productivity gains related to reduced-risk and combustible products) and lower marketing, administration and research costs (partly driven by cost efficiencies); partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix, mainly due to lower cigarette volume (primarily in Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, PMI Duty Free, Poland and Russia), partly offset by higher heated tobacco unit volume (notably in the EU, Japan, Russia and Ukraine, partially offset by PMI Duty Free); and the unfavorable impact of the deconsolidation of RBH, included in \"Cost/Other.\"\nInterest expense, net, of $618 million increased by $48 million (8.4%) due primarily to lower interest earned on cash balances.\nOur effective tax rate decreased by 1.5 percentage points to 21.7%.  The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was favorably impacted by changes in earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction, a reduction of U.S. state tax expense, a reduction of estimated U.S. federal income tax liabilities for years 2018 and 2019 due to final regulations under the GILTI provisions of the Internal Revenue Code ($93 million) and the corporate income tax rate reduction in Indonesia, partially offset by a decrease in deductions related to\n32\nforeign-derived intangible income for the years 2018 and 2019 and repatriation cost differences.  We estimate that our 2021 effective tax rate will be around 22%, excluding discrete tax events.  Changes in currency exchange rates, earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction or future regulatory developments may have an impact on the effective tax rates, which we monitor each quarter.  Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. For further details, see Item 8, Note 11.\nIncome Taxes\n.\nWe are regularly examined by tax authorities around the world, and we are currently under examination in a number of jurisdictions.  It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain tax examinations will close, which could result in a change in unrecognized tax benefits along with related interest and penalties.  An estimate of any possible change cannot be made at this time.\nNet earnings attributable to PMI of $8.1 billion increased by $871 million or 12.1%. This increase was due primarily to higher operating income as discussed above and a lower effective tax rate.  Diluted and basic EPS of $5.16 increased by 11.9%.  Excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.32, diluted EPS increased by 18.9%.\n2019 compared with 2018\nFor a discussion comparing our consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019, with the year ended December 31, 2018, refer to Part II, Item 7.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\n-\nDiscussion and Analysis - Consolidated Operating Results\nin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 7, 2020.\nOperating Results by Business Segment\nBusiness Environment\nTaxes, Legislation, Regulation and Other Matters Regarding the Manufacture, Marketing, Sale and Use of Tobacco Products\nThe tobacco industry and our company face a number of challenges that may adversely affect our business, volume, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.  These challenges, which are discussed below and in “\nCautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results\n,” include:\n•\nregulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other nicotine-containing products that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or even ban certain of our products;\n•\nfiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures;\n•\nillicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called “illicit whites”;\n•\nintense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers;\n•\npending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 17.\nContingencies\n; and\n•\ngovernmental investigations.\nRegulatory Restrictions:\nThe tobacco industry operates in a highly regulated environment.  The well-known risks of smoking have led regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the World Health Organization's (“WHO”) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (“FCTC”), which entered into force in 2005. The FCTC has as its main objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use.  To date, 181 countries and the European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and recommends others. The FCTC governing body, the Conference of the Parties (“CoP”), has also adopted non-binding guidelines and policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty.  In October 2018, the CoP recognized the need for more scientific assessment and improved reporting to define policy on heated tobacco products.  Similar to its previous policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as appropriate under their national laws.\n33\nIn July 2019, the WHO issued the Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic 2019. While citing insufficient independent studies regarding the benefits and the unknown long-term health impacts of electronic nicotine delivery systems and heated tobacco products, the WHO has taken the position that such products are not risk-free and should be regulated in the same manner as cigarettes and in line with the FCTC provisions.  It is not possible to predict whether or to what extent measures recommended by the WHO, including the FCTC guidelines, will be implemented.\nWe believe that when better alternatives to cigarettes exist, the discussion should not be whether these alternatives should be made available to the more than one billion men and women who smoke today, but how fast, and within what regulatory framework to maximize their adoption while minimizing unintended use. Therefore, we advocate for regulatory frameworks that recognize a significant difference on a risk continuum between combustible tobacco on the one hand and non-combustible tobacco and other nicotine-containing products on the other. Regulation should include measures that will accelerate switching to non-combustible products, for example, by allowing adult consumers who would not otherwise quit to receive truthful and non-misleading information about such products to enable them to make informed decisions and by applying uniform product standards to enable manufacturers to demonstrate the safety of these products as well as the absence of combustion. Regulation should also include specific rules for ingredients, labeling and consumer communication, and should ensure that the public is informed about the health risks of all combustible and non-combustible tobacco and nicotine-containing products. Importantly, regulation must include measures designed to prevent initiation by youth and non-smokers. We support mandated health warnings, minimum age laws, restrictions on advertising, and public place smoking restrictions. We also support regulatory measures that help reduce illicit trade.\nCertain measures are discussed in more detail below and in the\nReduced-Risk Products (RRPs)\nsection.\nFiscal Challenges:\nExcessive and disruptive excise, sales and other tax increases and discriminatory tax structures are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our profitability, due to lower consumption and consumer down-trading to non-premium, discount, other low-price or low-taxed combustible tobacco products such as fine cut tobacco and illicit cigarettes. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, some of our combustible products are subject to tax structures that discriminate against premium-price products and manufactured cigarettes.  We believe that such tax policies undermine public health by encouraging consumers to turn to illicit trade, and ultimately undercut government revenue objectives, disrupt the competitive environment, and encourage criminal activity. Other jurisdictions have imposed, or are seeking to impose, levies or other taxes specifically on tobacco companies, such as taxes on revenues and/or profits.\nWorld Customs Organization Developments\n: In 2020, the World Customs Organization (“WCO”) amended the harmonized system nomenclature to introduce dedicated custom codes for novel tobacco and nicotine products, including heated tobacco products, e-cigarettes and other nicotine-containing products. The amendments will be effective as of January 1, 2022. These amendments require WCO member states to transfer products from customs codes in the current nomenclature to the new one. These amendments are not expected to significantly impact current customs duty rates.\nEU Tobacco Products Directive:\nIn April 2014, the EU adopted a significantly revised EU Tobacco Products Directive (TPD), which entered into force in May 2016. All member states have adopted laws transposing the TPD.  The TPD sets forth a comprehensive set of regulatory requirements for tobacco products, including:\n•\nhealth warnings covering 65% of the front and back panels of cigarette packs, with an option for member states to further standardize tobacco packaging, including the introduction of plain packaging;\n•\na ban on characterizing flavors in some tobacco products, with a transition period for menthol that expired in May 2020;\n•\nsecurity features and tracking and tracing measures that became effective on May 20, 2019; and\n•\na framework for the regulation of novel tobacco products and e-cigarettes, including requirements for health warnings and information leaflets, a prohibition on product packaging text related to reduced risk, and the introduction of notification requirements or authorization procedures in advance of commercialization.\nThe EU Commission’s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety is preparing a report on the implementation of the TPD, including the evaluation of whether the TPD has achieved its objectives and is still relevant considering scientific, international and technical developments, including in novel tobacco products and e-cigarettes. The report is expected to include recommendations on potential revisions of the TPD to account for such developments.  The report is due by May 2021.\nEU Tobacco Excise Directive:\nThe EU Commission is preparing a legislative proposal for the revision of the 2011 EU Tobacco Excise Directive that may include definitions and tax treatment for novel tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including heated tobacco products and e-cigarettes. The proposal is expected to be finalized by the end of 2021. The adoption of the proposal will require  unanimous agreement by all EU member states.\n34\nPlain Packaging and Other Packaging Restrictions:\nPlain packaging legislation bans the use of branding, logos and colors on packaging other than the brand name and variant that may be printed only in specified locations and in a uniform font. To date, plain packaging laws have been adopted in certain markets in all of our operating segments, including the key markets of Australia, France, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Some countries, such as Canada, New Zealand, Israel and Denmark adopted plain packaging regulations that apply to all tobacco products, including RRPs. Other countries are also considering plain packaging legislation.\nSome countries have adopted, or are considering adopting, packaging restrictions that could have an impact similar to plain packaging.  Examples of such restrictions include standardizing the shape and size of packages, prohibiting certain colors or the use of certain descriptive phrases on packaging, and requiring very large graphic health warnings that leave little space for branding.\nRestrictions and Bans on the Use of Ingredients:\nThe WHO and others in the public health community have recommended restrictions or total bans on the use of some or all ingredients in tobacco products, including menthol.  Broad restrictions and ingredient bans would require us to reformulate our American blend tobacco products and could reduce our ability to differentiate these products in the market in the long term.  In many countries, menthol bans would eliminate the entire category of mentholated tobacco products.  The European Union banned cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco products with characterizing flavors. Other tobacco products, including heated tobacco products, are exempted from this flavor ban. The EU Commission is required to withdraw this exemption for  a particular product category if it determines that there is a substantial change of circumstances, such as a significant increase of EU-wide sales volumes in such product category. Other countries may follow the EU’s approach. Turkey banned menthol as of May 2020.   Broader ingredient bans have been adopted by Canada and Brazil.\nBans on Display of Tobacco Products at Retail:\nIn a number of our markets, including, but not limited to, Australia and Russia, governments have banned the display of tobacco products at the point of sale.  Other countries are considering similar bans.\nBans and Restrictions on Advertising, Marketing, Promotions and Sponsorships:\nFor many years, the FCTC has called for, and countries have imposed, partial or total bans on tobacco advertising, marketing, promotions and sponsorships, including bans and restrictions on advertising on radio and television, in print and on the Internet.  The FCTC's non-binding guidelines recommend that governments prohibit all forms of communication with adult smokers.\nRestrictions on Product Design:\nSome members of the public health community are calling for the further standardization of tobacco products by requiring, for example, that cigarettes have a certain minimum diameter, which would amount to a ban on slim cigarettes, or requiring the use of standardized filter and cigarette paper designs. In addition, at its meeting in November 2016, the CoP adopted non-binding guidelines recommending that countries regulate product design features that increase the attractiveness of tobacco products, such as the diameter of cigarettes and the use of flavor capsules.\nRestrictions on Public Smoking and Use of Nicotine-Containing Products in Public:\nThe pace and scope of restrictions on the use of our products have increased significantly in most of our markets.  Many countries around the world have adopted, or are likely to adopt, regulations that restrict or ban smoking and use of nicotine-containing products in public and/or work places, restaurants, bars and nightclubs. Some public health groups have called for, and some countries, regional governments and municipalities have adopted or proposed, bans on smoking in outdoor places, as well as bans on smoking in cars (typically, when minors are present) and private homes.\nOther Regulatory Issues:\nSome regulators are considering, or in some cases have adopted, regulatory measures designed to reduce the supply of tobacco products.  These include regulations intended to reduce the number of retailers selling tobacco products by, for example, reducing the overall number of tobacco retail licenses available or banning the sale of tobacco products within specified distances of certain public facilities.  In addition, South Africa banned the sale of tobacco products, e-cigarettes, and electronic devices that heat tobacco for several months during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ban, which was lifted on August 17, 2020, resulted in a significant increase of illicit trade of tobacco products.\nIn a limited number of markets, most notably Japan, we are dependent on governmental approvals that may limit our pricing flexibility.\nThe EU Single-Use Plastics Directive, which will require tobacco manufacturers and importers to cover the costs of public collection systems for tobacco product filters, entered into force on July 2, 2019, after which member states will have two years to transpose it into national law.  While we cannot predict the impact of this initiative on our business at this time, we are monitoring developments in this area.\nIllicit Trade:\nIllicit tobacco trade creates a cheap and unregulated supply of tobacco products, undermines efforts to reduce smoking prevalence, especially among youth, damages legitimate businesses and intellectual property rights, stimulates organized crime,\n35\nincreases corruption and reduces government tax revenue. Without accounting for any potential COVID-19-related impact, we generally estimate that, excluding China and the U.S., illicit trade may account for as much as 10 to 12% of global cigarette consumption; this includes counterfeit, contraband and the persistent problem of “illicit whites,” which are cigarettes legally produced in one jurisdiction for the sole purpose of being exported and illegally sold in another jurisdiction where they have no legitimate market. Currently, we estimate that illicit trade in the European Union accounted for approximately 8% of total cigarette consumption in 2019.\nA number of jurisdictions are considering actions to prevent illicit trade. In November 2012, the FCTC adopted the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products (the “Protocol”), which includes supply chain control measures,  such as licensing of manufacturers and distributors, enforcement  of these control measures in free trade zones, controls on duty free and Internet channels and the implementation of tracking and tracing technologies. To date, 62 Parties, including the European Union, have ratified it.  The Protocol came into force in September 2018. Parties must start implementing its provisions in their national legislation. In October 2018, the first Meeting of the Parties to the Protocol decided to produce a comprehensive report on good practices for the implementation of tracking and tracing systems and to prepare a conceptual framework for global information sharing to combat illicit tobacco trade. We welcome this decision and expect that other Parties will ratify the Protocol.\nWe devote substantial resources to help prevent illicit trade in combustible tobacco products and RRPs. For example, we engage with governments, our business partners and other stakeholders to implement effective measures to combat illicit trade and, in some instances, pursue legal remedies to protect our intellectual property rights.\nThe tracking and tracing regulations for cigarettes and roll-your-own products manufactured or destined for the EU became effective on May 20, 2019. The effective date for other tobacco-containing products, including some of our RRPs such as heated tobacco units, is May 20, 2024. While we expect that this regulation will increase our operating expenses, we do not expect this increase to be significant.\nIn 2009, our Colombian subsidiaries entered into an Investment and Cooperation Agreement with the national and regional governments of Colombia to promote investment in, and cooperation on, anti-contraband and anti-counterfeit efforts. The agreement provides $200 million in funding over a 20-year period to address issues such as combating illegal cigarette trade and increasing the quality and quantity of locally-grown tobacco.\nIn May 2016, PMI launched PMI IMPACT, a global initiative that supports third-party projects dedicated to fighting illegal trade and related crimes such as corruption, organized criminal networks and money laundering. The centerpiece of PMI IMPACT is a council of external independent experts in the fields of law, anti-corruption and law enforcement.  The experts are responsible for evaluating and approving funding proposals for PMI IMPACT grants.  PMI has pledged $100 million to fund projects within PMI IMPACT over three funding rounds.\nReduced-Risk Products (RRPs)\nOur Approach to RRPs:\nWe recognize that smoking cigarettes causes serious diseases and that the best way to avoid the harms of smoking is never to start or to quit.  Nevertheless, it is predicted that over the next decade the number of smokers will remain largely unchanged from the current estimate of 1.1 billion, despite the considerable efforts to discourage smoking.\nCigarettes burn tobacco, which produces smoke.  As a result of the combustion process, the smoker inhales various toxic substances.  In contrast, RRPs do not burn tobacco and produce an aerosol that contains significantly lower levels of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (\"HPHCs\") than found in cigarette smoke.\nFor adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke, we believe that RRPs, while not risk-free, offer a much better consumer choice.  Accordingly, our key strategic priorities are: to develop and commercialize products that present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to those products versus continued smoking; and to convince current adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch to those products.\nWe recognize that this transformation from cigarettes to RRPs will take time and that the speed of transformation will depend in part upon factors beyond our control, such as the willingness of governments, regulators and other policy groups to embrace RRPs as a desired alternative to continued cigarette smoking. We also recognize that our part in this transformation must be funded from our existing cigarette business. For as long as a significant number of adult smokers continues to smoke, it is critical that the industry be led by responsible and ethical manufacturers. Therefore, during the transformation, we intend to remain a leading international cigarette manufacturer.\n36\nWe have a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. We conduct rigorous scientific assessments of our RRP platforms to substantiate that they reduce exposure to HPHCs and, ultimately, that these products present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued smoking. We draw upon a team of expert scientists and engineers from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines and our extensive learnings of adult consumer preferences to develop and assess our RRPs. Our efforts are guided by the following key objectives:\n•\nto develop RRPs that adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke find to be satisfying alternatives to smoking;\n•\nfor those adult smokers, our goal is to offer RRPs with a scientifically substantiated risk-reduction profile that approaches as closely as possible that associated with smoking cessation;\n•\nto substantiate the reduction of risk for the individual adult smoker and the reduction of harm to the population as a whole, based on scientific evidence of the highest standard that is made available for scrutiny and review by external independent scientists and relevant regulatory bodies; and\n•\nto advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs, including the communication of scientifically substantiated information to enable adult smokers to make better consumer choices.\nOur RRP Platforms:\nOur product development is based on the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems for aerosol generation, which we believe is the most promising path to providing a better consumer choice for those who would otherwise continue to smoke. We recognize that no single product will appeal to all adult smokers. Therefore, we are developing a portfolio of products intended to appeal to a variety of distinct adult consumer preferences.\nFour PMI-developed RRP platforms are in various stages of development and commercialization readiness:\nPlatform 1\nuses a precisely controlled heating device incorporating our\nIQOS HeatControl\ntechnology, into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. We have conducted a series of clinical studies for this platform, the results of which were included in our submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) described below. We completed a 6+6-month exposure response study and shared the results with the FDA in April 2020.  The study showed that for the group that switched to our Platform 1 product, the eight clinical risk endpoints that were tested as co-primary endpoints in the first six-month term moved in the same direction as observed for smoking cessation after 12 months of use of this product. In addition, we completed an 18-month combined chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity study in mice, which was on-going at the time of our FDA submission. We shared the results with the FDA in August 2018.\nPlatform 2\nuses a pressed carbon heat source which, when ignited, generates a nicotine-containing aerosol by heating tobacco.  The results of our pharmacokinetic study (that measured the nicotine pharmacokinetic profile as well as subjective effects) and of our five-day reduced exposure study indicate that this platform could be an acceptable substitute for adult smokers who seek an alternative to cigarettes. The reduced exposure study results showed a substantial reduction in relevant biomarkers of exposure to the measured HPHCs in those who switched to Platform 2\ncompared to those who continued to smoke cigarettes over a five-day period.  The sustainability of this reduction as well as changes in clinical risk markers were assessed in a three-month reduced exposure study, which was completed in 2018.\nPlatform 3\nprovides an aerosol of nicotine salt. We have explored two routes for this platform, one with electronics and one without, and conducted nicotine pharmacokinetic studies with both versions.  The results of our pharmacokinetic study related to the version without electronics indicate this product's potential as an acceptable alternative to continued cigarette smoking in terms of product satisfaction.  In February 2020, we completed a product use and adaptation study in adult smokers for the product variant without electronics.\nPlatform 4\ncovers e-vapor products, which are battery-powered devices that produce an aerosol by vaporizing a nicotine-containing liquid solution. In 2020, our e-vapor products comprised devices with the “coil and wick” technology as well as our e-vapor mesh technology designed to ensure the consistency and quality of the generated aerosol compared to the products with the “coil and wick” technology. Recently, we discontinued the commercialization of devices with the “coil and wick” technology. We conducted a nicotine pharmacokinetic study with respect to products with our e-vapor mesh technology in 2017.   The results of this study indicate that these products are an effective means of nicotine delivery while being a satisfying alternative for e-cigarette users. In March 2019, a six-month pre-clinical study in mice evaluating the impact of e-cigarette vapor on the risks of pulmonary and cardiovascular disease compared to cigarette smoke was completed; this study did not pertain to a specific product.  The study demonstrated that e-cigarette vapors induce significantly lower biological responses associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases compared with cigarette smoke.\n37\nAfter we receive the results of our scientific studies mentioned above, in accordance with standard scientific practices, we intend to share the conclusions in scientific forums and to submit them for inclusion in peer-reviewed publications.\nThe research and development expense for our RRP portfolio accounted for 99%, 98% and 92% of our total research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, is set forth in Item 8, Note 14.\nAdditional Information\nto the consolidated financial statements.\nCommercialization of RRPs:\nWe are building a new product category and tailor our commercialization strategy to the characteristics of each specific market. We focus our commercialization efforts on consumer retail experience, guided consumer trials and customer care, and increasingly, digital communication programs and e-commerce.  In order to accelerate switching to our Platform 1 products, our initial market introductions typically entail one-to-one consumer engagement (in person or by digital means) and device discounts.  These initial commercialization efforts require substantial investment, which we believe will moderate over time and further benefit from the increased use of digital engagement capabilities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated our investments in, and pivot to, digital consumer engagement.\nIn 2014, we introduced our Platform 1 product in pilot city launches in Nagoya, Japan, and in Milan, Italy. Since then, we have continuously expanded our commercialization activities, and as of December 31, 2020 the product has been commercialized in 64 markets in key cities or nationwide. While our Platform 1 products are currently available for sale in Mexico, that country banned the importation of e-cigarettes and devices that heat tobacco.\nWe believe that only a very small percentage of adult smokers who convert to our Platform 1 product switch back to cigarettes.\nWe have integrated the production of our heated tobacco units into a number of our existing manufacturing facilities, are progressing with our plans to build manufacturing capacity for our other RRP platforms, and continue to optimize our manufacturing infrastructure.\nAn adequate supply chain for our RRP portfolio, including the supply of electronic devices, is important to our business. We work with two electronics manufacturing service providers for the supply of our Platform 1 and\nIQOS\nVEEV\ndevices and a small number of other providers for other products in our RRP portfolio and related accessories.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the operations of our two electronic manufacturing service providers were temporarily suspended at different times. Even though these suspensions did not materially affect our operations, if both of these service providers were significantly constrained at the same time, the supply of the devices could be disrupted. Although we work closely with these service providers on monitoring their production capability and financial health, we cannot guarantee that they will remain capable of meeting their commitments, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; if they will not, the commercialization of our RRPs could be adversely affected. The production of our RRP portfolio requires various metals, and we believe that there is an adequate supply of such metals in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production requirements. However, some components and materials necessary for the production of our RRPs, including those for the electronic devices, are obtained from single or limited sources, and can be subject to industry-wide shortages and price fluctuations. While we were successful in maintaining adequate supply of such components and materials so far, we may not be able to secure such supply going forward, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; this could negatively impact the commercialization of our RRPs. For details on the impact of COVID-19 on our production and supply chain, see the \"\nExecutive Summary\n\" section within this Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nOur Platform 1 and\nIQOS VEEV\ndevices are subject to standard product warranties generally for a period of 12 months from the date of purchase or such other periods as required by law.  We discuss product warranties in more detail in Item 8, Note 5.\nProduct Warranty\n.  The significance of warranty claims is dependent on a number of factors, including device version mix, product failure rates, logistics and service delivery costs, and warranty policies, and may increase with the number of devices sold.\nProduct quality may affect consumer acceptance of our RRPs.\nOur commercialization efforts for the other RRP platforms are as follows:\n•\nIn 2020, we started commercializing an improved version of our\nIQOS MESH\nproduct in New Zealand and the Czech Republic under the\nIQOS VEEV\nbrand name. We currently plan to launch this product in additional markets under the\nIQOS VEEV\nor\nVEEV\nbrand names.\n38\n•\nWith respect to\nTEEPS\n, our Platform 2 product, we are finalizing our improvements to this product and plan to conduct a consumer test in 2021.\n•\nFollowing the consumer test conducted in 2020 and the results of the product use and adaptation study described above, we are incorporating our learnings into our plans to improve our Platform 3 product.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, these plans may be delayed.\nRRP Regulation and Taxation:\nRRPs contain nicotine and are not risk-free. As we describe in more detail above, we support science-based regulation and taxation of RRPs and believe that regulation and taxation should differentiate between cigarettes and products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking and should recognize a continuum of risk for tobacco and other nicotine-containing products. Regulation, as well as industry practices, should reflect the fact that youth should not consume nicotine in any form.\nSome governments have banned or are seeking to ban or severely restrict emerging tobacco and nicotine-containing products such as our RRPs and communication of truthful and non-misleading information about such products. For example, the commercialization of e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn products is prohibited in Australia, the commercialization of e-cigarettes is prohibited in Argentina, the importation of e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn products is prohibited in Turkey, and the importation of e-cigarettes and devices that heat tobacco is prohibited in Mexico.\nThese regulations might foreclose or unreasonably restrict adult consumer access even to products that might be shown to be a better consumer choice than continuing to smoke. During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments may temporarily be unable to focus on the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of RRPs or on the enforcement or implementation of regulations that are significant to our business.\nWe oppose blanket bans and unreasonable restrictions of products that have the potential to present less risk of harm compared to continued smoking.  By contrast, we support regulation that sets clear standards for all RRP categories and propels innovation to benefit adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke.\nIn the United States, an established regulatory framework for assessing “Modified Risk Tobacco Products” and “New Tobacco Products” exists under the jurisdiction of the FDA. We submitted to the FDA a Modified Risk Tobacco Product Application (“MRTPA”) for our Platform 1 product in December 2016, and a Premarket Tobacco Product Application (“PMTA”) for our Platform 1 product in March 2017.\nOn April 30, 2019, the FDA determined that a version of our Platform 1 product, namely,\nIQOS\n2.4 and three related consumables, is appropriate for the protection of public health and authorized it for sale in the United States. The FDA’s decision followed its comprehensive assessment of our PMTA. On December 7, 2020, the FDA reached the same determination for the\nIQOS\n3\ndevice and authorized that version of our Platform 1 product for sale in the United States.\nOn July 7, 2020, the FDA determined that the available scientific evidence demonstrates that the issuance of an exposure modification order would be appropriate for the promotion of public health and authorized the marketing of a version of our Platform 1 product, namely\nIQOS\n2.4 and three related consumables, as a \"modified risk tobacco product.\"  The FDA authorized the marketing of this product in the U.S. with the following information:\n\"AVAILABLE EVIDENCE TO DATE:\n•\nthe\nIQOS\nsystem heats tobacco but does not burn it.\n•\nthis significantly reduces the production of harmful and potentially harmful chemicals.\n•\nscientific studies have shown that switching completely from conventional cigarettes to the\nIQOS\nsystem significantly reduces your body’s exposure to harmful or potentially harmful chemicals.\"\nWe must request and receive authorization from the FDA in order to continue marketing this product with the same modified exposure information after the present order expires in four years.\nThere are two types of MRTP orders the FDA may issue: a “risk modification” order or an “exposure modification” order. We had requested both types of orders.  After review, the FDA determined that the evidence did not support issuing a \"risk modification\" order at this time but that it did support issuing an \"exposure modification\" order for the product. This determination included a finding that issuance of the exposure modification order is expected to benefit the health of the population as a whole.\n39\nWe look forward to working with the FDA to provide any additional information they may require in order to market this product with reduced risk claims.\nThe FDA’s PMTA and MRTP orders do not mean that the agency “approved” our Platform 1 product. These authorizations are subject to strict marketing, reporting and other requirements and are not a guarantee that the product will remain authorized, particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth or non-smoker initiation.  The FDA will monitor the marketing of the product.\nSome states and municipalities in the U.S. have introduced severe restrictions for the sale of certain e-cigarettes and tobacco products, including those authorized by the FDA. We believe that such restrictions on FDA-authorized products will not advance public health and will unreasonably limit adult consumer access to products that are shown to be a better alternative to continued smoking.\nIn March 2020, we requested a clarification from the FDA regarding the applicability of its new health warning requirements to our heated tobacco units sold in the United States.\nIn the U.S., tobacco and nicotine-containing products that were not commercially marketed as of February 15, 2007 are subject to review and authorization by the FDA. Manufacturers of all non-authorized products currently on the market were required to file a PMTA with the FDA by September 9, 2020. The FDA announced on September 9, 2020 that it will prioritize enforcement against any tobacco and nicotine-containing product sold without a PMTA.\nFDA actions may influence the regulatory approach of other governments.\nUntil recently, there were no countries with specific product standards for heat-not-burn products. Currently, national standards setting minimum quality and safety requirements for such products have been adopted in several countries with technical heat-not-burn specifications and/or methods for demonstrating the absence of combustion. They are mandatory in Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and the UAE, and voluntary in the U.K., Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Vietnam, and Indonesia. In Japan, a voluntary standard sets minimum safety requirements for tobacco heating devices. We expect other governments to consider similar product standards and encourage making them mandatory.\nAll EU member states have transposed the EU Tobacco Products Directive, including the provisions on novel tobacco products, such as heated tobacco units, and e-cigarettes.  Most of the EU member states require a notification submitted six months before the intended placing on the market of a novel tobacco product, while some require pre-market authorizations for the introduction of such products.  To date, we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of our Platform 1 product in over 20 member states.\nIn addition, in Italy, in April 2018, we submitted an application for\nHEETS\n, used with the\nIQOS\ndevice, requesting regulatory recognition of the reduction of toxic substances and potential risk reduction resulting from switching to this product compared to continued cigarette smoking.  In January 2019, our application was not granted primarily on the grounds of insufficient data and questions of methodology.  Due to the constraints of the review process, we had been unable to supplement the application with all the data we subsequently filed with the FDA and to address methodological questions during the review. We plan to submit a new application where we will clarify the concerns raised by the decision and further strengthen our application by submitting additional evidence that became available since we submitted our first application, consistent with our FDA filings. We are confident that our evidence supports our application.\nOn October 31, 2019, our Australian subsidiary, Philip Morris Limited (“PML”), submitted an application to the Scheduling Committee of the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia (“TGA”) seeking to exempt heated tobacco products from being prohibited in Australia. In August 2020, the TGA issued its decision denying the application and stating that it did not present compelling evidence to establish a public health benefit from greater access to nicotine in heated tobacco products.\nTo date, several governmental agencies have published their scientific findings that analyze the harm-reduction potential of certain RRPs versus continuing smoking, including:\nIn December 2017, at the request of the U.K. Department of Health and Public Health England, the U.K. Committee on Toxicity published its assessment of the risk of heat-not-burn products relative to cigarette smoking.  This assessment included analysis of scientific data for two heat-not-burn products, one of which was our Platform 1 product.  The assessment concluded that, while still harmful to health, compared with the known risks from cigarettes, heat-not-burn products are probably less harmful. Subsequently, in February 2018, Public Health England published a report stating that the available evidence suggests that heat-not-burn products may be considerably less harmful than cigarettes and more harmful than e-cigarettes.\n40\nIn May 2018, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (“BfR”) published a study on the Platform 1 aerosol relative to cigarette smoke using the Health Canada Intense Smoking Regimen. BfR found reductions in selected HPHCs in a range of 80-99%.  This publication indicates that significant reductions in the levels of selected toxicants are likely to reduce toxicant exposure, which BfR stated might be regarded as a discrete benefit compared to combustible cigarettes.\nIn May 2018, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment (“RIVM”) published a factsheet on novel tobacco products that heat rather than burn tobacco, focusing on our Platform 1 product.  RIVM analyzed the aerosol generated by our Platform 1 product and concluded that the use of this product, while still harmful to health, is probably less harmful than continued smoking.\nIn June 2018, the Korean Food and Drug Administration (“KFDA”) issued a statement on products that heat rather than burn tobacco.  The KFDA tested three heat-not-burn products, one of which was our Platform 1 product. The  KFDA confirmed that the levels of the nine HPHCs tested in the aerosol of these products were on average approximately 90% lower compared to those measured in the cigarette smoke of the top five cigarette brands in South Korea. However, the KFDA stated that it could not establish that the tested heat-not-burn products are less harmful than cigarettes. In October 2018, our Korean subsidiary filed a request with a local court seeking information underlying KFDA’s analysis, conclusions and public statements.  In May 2020, the court ordered KFDA to produce certain records.\nIn August 2018, the Science & Technology Committee of the U.K. House of Commons published a report of its inquiry into e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn products. The report concluded that e-cigarettes are significantly less harmful to health than smoking tobacco.  The report also observed that for those smokers who do not accept e-cigarettes, heat-not-burn products may offer a public health benefit despite their relative risk.  The report called for a risk-proportionate regulatory environment for both e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn products and noted that e-cigarettes should remain the least taxed, cigarettes the most taxed, with heat-not-burn products falling between the two.  The U.K. Committee on Advertising Practice announced the removal of a prohibition of health claims in the advertising of e-cigarettes in the U.K. effective November 2018.\nIn November 2018, the Eurasian Economic Commission (regulatory body of the Eurasian Union consisting of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia) published the results of its commissioned study on novel nicotine-containing products, including our Platform 1 product. The study confirms significantly lower levels of HPHCs in the aerosol generated by this product compared to cigarette smoke.\nIn January 2019, scientific media published the results of the study of the China National Tobacco Quality Supervision and Test Centre (“CNTQST”) comparing the aerosol generated by our Platform 1 product with cigarette smoke. The CNTQST found that the former contained fewer, and lower levels of, harmful constituents than the latter and concluded that the lower temperature of heating tobacco in our Platform 1 product contributed to the difference. The CNTQST stated that the reduction in emissions of harmful constituents cannot be interpreted as equivalent to a proportionate harm/risk reduction for smokers.\nThe foregoing scientific findings of government agencies may not be indicative of the measures that the relevant government authorities could take in regulating our products.\nWe make our scientific findings publicly available for scrutiny and peer review through several channels, including our websites. From time to time, adult consumers, competitors, members of the scientific community, and others inquire into our scientific methodologies, challenge our scientific conclusions or request further study of certain aspects of our RRPs and their health effects. We are committed to a robust and open scientific debate and believe that such debate should be based on accurate and reliable scientific information. We seek to provide accurate and reliable scientific information about our RRPs; nonetheless, we may not be able to prevent third-party dissemination of false, misleading or unsubstantiated information about these products.  The dissemination of scientifically unsubstantiated information or studies with a strong confirmation bias by third parties may cause confusion among adult smokers and affect their decision to switch to better alternatives to continued smoking, such as our RRPs.\nTo date, we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our heated tobacco units are not cigarettes due to the absence of combustion, and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products, which typically yields more favorable tax rates than cigarettes. Although we believe that this is sensible from the public health perspective, we cannot guarantee that regulators will continue this approach.\nThere can be no assurance that we will succeed in our efforts to replace cigarettes with RRPs or that regulation will allow us to commercialize RRPs in all markets, to communicate about our RRPs, including making scientifically substantiated risk-reduction claims, or to treat RRPs differently from cigarettes.\n41\nLegal Challenges to RRPs:\nWe face various administrative and legal challenges related to certain RRP activities, including allegations concerning product classification, advertising restrictions, corporate communications, product coach activities, scientific substantiation, product liability, and unfair competition.  While we design our programs to comply with relevant regulations, we expect these or similar challenges to continue as we expand our efforts to commercialize RRPs and to communicate publicly.  The outcomes of these matters may affect our RRP commercialization and public communication activities and performance in one or more markets.\nOur RRP Business Development Initiatives:\nIn December 2013, we established a strategic framework with Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”) setting out terms on how the parties would collaborate to develop and commercialize e-vapor products and commercialize two of our RRPs in the U.S. In late 2018, Altria announced that it will participate in the e-vapor category only through another e-vapor company in which Altria acquired a minority interest. In September 2019, Altria's subsidiary, Philip Morris USA Inc. (“PM USA”), began commercialization of a version of our Platform 1 product in the U.S.  PM USA is responsible for the marketing of this product in the U.S. and communication of the reduced exposure information authorized by the FDA in its MRTP marketing order described above.\nIn January 2020, we announced an agreement with KT&G, a leading tobacco and nicotine company in South Korea, for the commercialization of KT&G’s smoke-free products outside of South Korea on an exclusive basis. For more information, see\nAcquisitions and Other Business Arrangements\nbelow.\nOther Developments:\nIn September 2017, we announced our support of the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World. In September 2020, our pledge agreement with the Foundation was amended. We contributed $45 million in 2020 and expect to contribute $40 million in 2021 and $35 million annually from 2022 through 2029, as specified in the amended pledge agreement. To date, we contributed a total of $209.5 million. The Foundation is an independent body and is governed by its independent Board of Directors.  The Foundation’s role, as set out in its corporate charter, includes funding research in the field of tobacco harm reduction, encouraging measures that reduce the harm caused by smoking, and assessing the effect of reduced cigarette consumption on the industry value chain.\nGovernmental Investigations\nFrom time to time, we are subject to governmental investigations on a range of matters, including tax, customs, antitrust, advertising, and labor practices.  We describe certain matters pending in Thailand, Russia and South Korea in Item 8, Note 17.\nContingencies\n.\nIn November 2010, a WTO panel issued its decision in a dispute relating to facts that arose from August 2006 between the Philippines and Thailand concerning a series of Thai customs and tax measures affecting cigarettes imported by PM Thailand into Thailand (see Item 8, Note 17.\nContingencies\nfor additional information). The WTO panel decision, which was upheld by the WTO Appellate Body, concluded that Thailand had no basis to find that PM Thailand's declared customs values and taxes paid were too low, as alleged by the Department of Special Investigations of the government of Thailand (“DSI”) in 2009. The decision also created obligations for Thailand to revise its laws, regulations, or practices affecting the customs valuation and tax treatment of future cigarette imports. Thailand agreed in September 2011 to fully comply with the decision by October 2012. The Philippines asserts that to date Thailand has not fully complied with the WTO panel decision and commenced challenges at the WTO Appellate Body. The WTO Appellate Body is not operational, and the appeals by Thailand are suspended indefinitely. In December 2020, the Philippines and Thailand agreed to pursue facilitator-assisted discussions aimed at progressing and resolving outstanding issues. It is not possible to predict any future developments in these proceedings or the outcome of these discussions.\nThe Public Prosecutor’s office of Rome, Italy, notified our Italian subsidiary, Philip Morris Italia S.r.l. (“PM Italia”), as well as three former or current employees and a former external consultant of PM Italia in July 2020 and March 2020, respectively, that it  concluded a preliminary investigation against them for alleged contravention of anti-corruption laws and related disruption of trade freedom. The Public Prosecutor alleges that the individuals involved promised certain personal favors to government officials from January to July of 2018 in exchange for favorable treatment for PM Italia, and that PM Italia lacked appropriate organizational controls to prevent the alleged actions by the individuals. In September 2020, the Public Prosecutor referred the matter to trial. PM Italia believes the charges brought against it by the Public Prosecutor are without merit and will defend them vigorously.\nAsset Impairment and Exit Costs\nWe discuss asset impairment and exit costs in Item 8, Note 19.\nAsset Impairment and Exit Costs\nto our consolidated financial statements.\n42\nAcquisitions and Other Business Arrangements\nWe discuss our acquisitions in Item 8, Note 6.\nAcquisitions\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nGlobal Collaboration Agreement with KT&G\nIn January 2020, PMI announced a global collaboration agreement with the leading tobacco and nicotine company in South Korea, KT&G, to commercialize KT&G’s smoke-free products outside of the country. The agreement will run for an initial period of three years.  The two companies plan for global collaboration with the intention to actively expand to cover many markets, based on commercial success.  The agreement allows PMI to distribute current KT&G smoke-free products, and their evolutions, on an exclusive basis, and does not restrict PMI from distributing its own or third-party products. KT&G’s smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heat-not-burn tobacco products (e.g.,\nLIL Mini\nand\nLIL Plus\n), hybrid technologies that combine heat-not-burn tobacco and e-vapor technologies (e.g.,\nLIL HYBRID\n), and e-vapor products (e.g.,\nLIL Vapor\n).  PMI will be responsible for the commercialization of smoke-free products supplied under the agreement.\nProducts sold under the agreement are subject to careful assessment to ensure they meet the regulatory requirements in the markets where they are launched, as well as our standards of quality and scientific substantiation to confirm the absence of combustion and significant reductions of emissions of harmful chemicals compared to cigarettes.  PMI and KT&G will seek any necessary regulatory approvals that may be required on a market-by-market basis.  There are no current plans to commercialize KT&G products in the United States.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, we launched commercial initiatives for licensed KT&G products in select markets.\nEquity Investments\nWe discuss our equity investments in Item 8, Note 4.\nRelated Parties - Equity Investments and Other\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nTrade Policy\nWe are subject to various trade restrictions imposed by the United States of America and countries in which we do business (“Trade Sanctions”), including the trade and economic sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control and the U.S. Department of State.  It is our policy to comply fully with these Trade Sanctions.\nTobacco products are agricultural products under U.S. law and are not technological or strategic in nature.  From time to time we make sales in countries subject to Trade Sanctions, either where such sanctions do not apply to our business or pursuant to exemptions or licenses.\nA subsidiary sells products to distributors that, in turn, sell those products to duty free customers that supply U.N. peacekeeping forces around the world, including those in the U.N. peacekeeping mission located in Abyei, a special administrative territory in Sudan.  We do not believe that these sales, which are not subject to Trade Sanctions, and are\nde minimis\nin volume and value, present a material risk to our shareholders, our reputation or the value of our shares. We have no employees, operations or assets in Sudan.\nWe do not sell products in Iran, North Korea and Syria. From time to time, we explore opportunities to sell our products in one or more of these countries, as permitted by law.\nWe sell cigarettes in Cuba under a distribution agreement. These sales are permitted by U.S. law under a License Exception for Agricultural Commodities, issued by the United States Department of Commerce (Bureau of Industry and Security), granted to our distributor.\nCertain states within the U.S. have enacted legislation permitting or requiring state pension funds to divest or abstain from future investment in stocks of companies that do business with certain countries that are sanctioned by the U.S. Because we do business in certain of these countries, these state pension funds may have divested of our stock or may not invest in our stock. We do not believe such legislation has had a material effect on the price of our shares.\n43\n2020 compared with 2019\nThe following discussion compares operating results within each of our operating segments for 2020 with 2019.\nUnless otherwise stated, references to total industry, total market, our shipment volume and our market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units. Estimates for total industry volume and market share in certain geographies reflect limitations on the availability and accuracy of industry data.\nEuropean Union:\nNet revenues, excluding favorable currency, increased by 8.8%, reflecting: favorable volume/mix, mainly driven by higher heated tobacco unit volume across the Region (notably in the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Poland), partly offset by lower cigarette volume (notably in the Czech Republic, Italy, Poland and Spain, partly offset by Germany) and lower cigarette mix (mainly in Germany); and a favorable pricing variance (driven by higher combustible pricing, notably in Germany, partly offset by lower heated tobacco unit and\nIQOS\ndevice pricing).\nOperating income, excluding unfavorable currency, increased by 29.0%, notably reflecting a favorable comparison, shown in \"Cost/Other,\" of asset impairment and exit costs recorded in 2020 associated with organizational design optimization ($57 million), to those recorded in 2019 associated with a plant closure in Germany ($342 million).\nExcluding these asset impairment and exit costs, as well as unfavorable currency of $24 million, operating income increased by 20.1%, primarily reflecting: favorable volume/mix, mainly driven by the same factors as for net revenues noted above;

and lower fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets, shown in \"Cost/Other\"; partially offset by a favorable pricing variance, driven by combustible pricing (mainly in the GCC, particularly Saudi Arabia, as well as North Africa and PMI Duty Free, partly offset by Turkey).\nOperating income, excluding unfavorable currency, decreased by 35.2%, mainly reflecting: unfavorable volume/mix, predominantly due to lower cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume in PMI Duty Free; and lower fees for certain distribution rights as noted above for net revenues; partially offset by a favorable pricing variance; and lower marketing, administration and research costs.\nExcluding asset impairment and exit costs of $19 million in 2020 and unfavorable currency of $65 million, operating income decreased by 34.1%.\nMiddle East & Africa - Total Market, PMI Shipment Volume and Market Share Commentaries\nThe estimated total market in the Middle East & Africa decreased by 8.0% to 546.4 billion units, mainly due to:\n•\nInternational Duty Free, down by 62.0%, reflecting the impact of government travel restrictions and reduced passenger traffic due to the pandemic;\n•\nSouth Africa, down by 35.5%, primarily reflecting the impact of the pandemic-related ban on all tobacco sales from March 27, 2020, through August 17, 2020;\n•\nTurkey, down by 4.2%, mainly reflecting the impact of lockdown measures on adult smoker average daily consumption, as well as a higher prevalence of illicit trade related to cut tobacco, particularly during the first-half of 2020, following significant industry-wide cigarette price increases in 2019; and\n•\nThe UAE, down by 38.1%, primarily reflecting the adverse impact on low-price brands from the implementation of a minimum excise tax and digital tax stamps in the second half of 2019.\nOur Regional market share decreased by 1.4 points to 22.0%.\nOur total shipment volume decreased by 13.3% to 119.0 billion units, notably due to:\n•\nPMI Duty Free, down by 70.8%, or by 58.8% excluding the net unfavorable impact of estimated distributor inventory movements (principally due to cigarettes), mainly reflecting the lower total market; and\n47\n•\nTurkey, down by 8.5%, mainly reflecting the lower total market and a lower market share, notably due to adult smoker down-trading following the 2019 price increases.\nSouth & Southeast Asia:\nNet revenues, excluding unfavorable currency, decreased by 13.3%, reflecting: unfavorable volume/mix, primarily due to lower cigarette volume in Indonesia and the Philippines, partly offset by favorable cigarette mix in Indonesia; and an unfavorable pricing variance, due to combustible pricing in Indonesia, partly offset by the Philippines.\nOperating income, excluding favorable currency, decreased by 21.1%, mainly reflecting: unfavorable volume/mix, due to the same factors as for net revenues noted above; and an unfavorable pricing variance; partly offset by lower marketing, administration and research costs (primarily in Indonesia).\nExcluding asset impairment and exit costs of $23 million in 2020 and $20 million in 2019, as well as favorable currency of $2 million, operating income decreased by 20.8%.\nSouth & Southeast Asia - Total Market, PMI Shipment Volume and Market Share Commentaries\nThe estimated total market in South & Southeast Asia decreased by 8.7% to 672.3 billion units, notably due to:\n•\nIndia, down by 17.9%, mainly reflecting the impact of lockdown restrictions on the movement of certain products, including tobacco;\n•\nIndonesia, down by 9.6%, mainly reflecting the impact of excise tax-driven price increases and pandemic-related measures on adult smoker average daily consumption;\n•\nPakistan, down by 10.3%, mainly reflecting the impact of excise tax-driven price increases in June 2019 and price increases on PMI value brands in February 2020;

Excluding unfavorable currency movements of $0.5 billion, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $0.2 billion, due primarily to higher net earnings (excluding 2019 non-cash charges related to the Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense and the loss on deconsolidation of RBH), partially offset by higher working capital requirements of $0.5 billion and higher cash payments in 2020 for asset impairment and exit costs. For further details, see Item 8, Note 19.\nAsset Impairment and Exit Costs\nfor additional information.\nHigher net earnings in 2020, excluding the impact of the above 2019 non-cash charges, were partly attributable to the Russia excise and VAT audit charge of $374 million which was paid in the third quarter of 2019.  For further details, Item 8, Note 17.\nContingencies\nfor additional information.\nThe higher working capital requirements were primarily due to net cash used in inventories and accrued liabilities and other current assets reflecting COVID-19 pandemic related build-up of inventory in our supply chain, and the timing of excise tax-paid inventory movements and excise tax payments.  This change was partially offset by cash provided by accounts receivable due to the varying levels of usage of our factoring arrangements to sell trade receivables and timing of sales and cash collections.\n•\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased by $0.7 billion from the comparable 2019 period.  This decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the reduction of cash in 2019 resulting from the deconsolidation of RBH and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher cash collateral posted to secure derivatives designated as net investment hedges of Euro assets principally related to changes in exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S. dollar.  For further details on deconsolidation of RBH, see Item 8. Note 20.\nDeconsolidation of RBH\n.  For further details on\n52\nour derivatives designated as net investment hedges, see Item 8. Note 15.\nFinancial Instruments\n.\nOur capital expenditures were $0.6 billion in 2020 and $0.9 billion in 2019.  The 2020 expenditures were primarily related to our ongoing investments in RRPs.  We expect total capital expenditures in 2021 of approximately $0.8 billion (including capital expenditures related to our ongoing investment in RRPs), to be funded by operating cash flows.\n•\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities of $8.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, increased by $0.4 billion from the comparable 2019 period.  The change was due primarily to higher payments to noncontrolling interests and higher dividends paid, partially offset by debt activity.\nDividends paid in 2020 and 2019 were $7.4 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively.\n2019 compared with 2018\nFor a discussion comparing our net cash activities (operating, investing and financing) for the year ended December 31, 2019, with the year ended December 31, 2018, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Financial Review in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 7, 2020.\nDebt and Liquidity\nWe define cash and cash equivalents as short-term, highly liquid investments, readily convertible to known amounts of cash that mature within a maximum of three months and have an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate or credit risk changes. As a policy, we do not hold any investments in structured or equity-linked products. Our cash and cash equivalents are predominantly held in demand deposits with institutions that have investment-grade long-term credit rating.  As part of our cash management strategy and in order to manage counterparty exposure, we also enter into reverse repurchase agreements. Such agreements are collateralized with government or corporate securities held by a custodial bank and, at maturity, cash is paid back to PMI, and the collateral is returned to the bank.  For 2020 and 2019, the activities for such reverse repurchase agreements were not material.\nWe utilize long-term and short-term debt financing, including a commercial paper program that is regularly used to finance ongoing liquidity requirements, as part of our overall cash management strategy.  Our ability to access the capital and credit markets as well as overall dynamics of these markets may impact borrowing costs.  We expect that the combination of our long-term and short-term debt financing, the commercial paper program and the committed credit facilities, coupled with our operating cash flows, will enable us to meet our liquidity requirements.\nCredit Ratings\n–\nThe cost and terms of our financing arrangements as well as our access to commercial paper markets may be affected by applicable credit ratings. At February 8, 2021, our credit ratings and outlook by major credit rating agencies were as follows:\n53\nCredit Facilities\n–\nOn January 29, 2021, we entered into an agreement to amend and extend the term of our 364-day revolving credit facility from February 2, 2021, to February 1, 2022 in the amount of $1.75 billion.\nAt February 8, 2021, our committed credit facilities were as follows:\n(a)\nOn January 29, 2021, we entered into an agreement, effective February 10, 2021, to amend and extend the term of our $2.0 billion multi-year revolving credit facility, for an additional year covering the period February 11, 2025 to February 10, 2026, in the amount of $1.86 billion.\nAt February 8, 2021, there were no borrowings under the committed credit facilities, and the entire committed amounts were available for borrowing.\nAll banks participating in our committed credit facilities have an investment-grade long-term credit rating from the credit rating agencies.  We continuously monitor the credit quality of our banking group, and at this time we are not aware of any potential non-performing credit provider.\nThese facilities do not include any credit rating triggers, material adverse change clauses or any provisions that could require us to post collateral.  The $3.5 billion multi-year revolving credit facility in the table above requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“consolidated EBITDA”) to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.5 to 1.0 on a rolling four-quarter basis.  At December 31, 2020, our ratio calculated in accordance with the agreement was 12.6 to 1.0.  We expect to continue to meet our covenants. The terms “consolidated EBITDA” and “consolidated interest expense,” both of which include certain adjustments, are defined in the facility agreements previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIn addition to the committed credit facilities discussed above, certain of our subsidiaries maintain short-term credit arrangements to meet their respective working capital needs.  These credit arrangements, which amounted to approximately $2.7 billion at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, are for the sole use of our subsidiaries.  Borrowings under these arrangements and other bank loans amounted to $244 million at December 31, 2020, and $338 million at December 31, 2019.\nCommercial Paper Program –\nWe continue to have access to liquidity in the commercial paper market through programs in place in the U.S. and in Europe having an aggregate issuance capacity of $8.0 billion.  At December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, we had no commercial paper outstanding.  The average commercial paper balance outstanding during 2020 and 2019\nwas $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.\nSale of Accounts Receivable\n–\nTo mitigate credit risk and enhance cash and liquidity management, we sell trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions.  These arrangements allow us to sell, on an ongoing basis, certain trade receivables without recourse.  The trade receivables sold are generally short-term in nature and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets. We sell trade receivables under two types of arrangements, servicing and nonservicing.\nOur operating cash flows were positively impacted by the amount of the trade receivables sold and derecognized from the consolidated balance sheets, which remained outstanding with the unaffiliated financial institutions.  The trade receivables sold that remained outstanding under these arrangements as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were $1.2 billion, $0.9 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.  The net proceeds received are included in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nFor further details, see Item 8, Note 18.\nSale of Accounts Receivable\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nDebt\n–\nOur total debt was $31.5 billion at December 31, 2020, and $31.0 billion at December 31, 2019.  Our total debt is primarily fixed rate in nature.  The weighted-average all-in financing cost of our total debt was 2.4% in 2020 and 2.5% in 2019.  For further\n54\ndetails, including the fair value of our debt, see Item 8, Note 7.\nIndebtedness\n.  The amount of debt that we can issue is subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\nOn February 11, 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, under which we may from time to time sell debt securities and/or warrants to purchase debt securities over a three-year period.\nOur debt issuances in 2020 were as follows:\n(a)\nInterest on these notes is payable semi-annually in arrears beginning in November 2020.\n(b)\nInterest on these notes is payable semi-annually in arrears beginning in May 2021.\nThe net proceeds from the sale of the securities listed in the table above have been and will be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and redemption on January 25, 2021, of our outstanding $750 million 1.875% U.S. dollar notes due February 25, 2021.\nThe weighted-average time to maturity of our long-term debt was 9.7 years at the end of 2020 and 10.2 years at the end of 2019.\n•\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including special purpose entities, other than guarantees and contractual obligations discussed below.\nGuarantees\n–\nAt December 31, 2020, we were contingently liable for guarantees of our own performance, of which $0.3 billion were related to our obligations under indemnity agreements to enable appeals of customs assessments against our distributors. In October 2020, we guaranteed an obligation for an equity method investee.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 17.\nContingencies\nto our consolidated financial statements.  Additionally, we have other guarantees of our own performance, which are primarily related to excise taxes on the shipment of our products. There is no liability in the consolidated financial statements associated with these guarantees. These guarantees have not had, and are not expected to have, a significant impact on PMI’s liquidity.\n55\nAggregate Contractual Obligations\n–\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2020:\n(1)\nAmounts represent the expected cash payments at the face value of our long-term debt and finance lease obligations.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 7.\nIndebtedness\nto our consolidated financial statements.\n(2)\nAmounts represent the expected cash payments of our interest expense on our long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt. Interest on our fixed-rate debt is presented using the stated interest rate. Interest on our variable debt is estimated using the rate in effect at December 31, 2020. Amounts exclude the amortization of debt discounts, the amortization of loan fees and fees for lines of credit that would be included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n(3)\nAmounts represent the maturity of PMI's operating lease liabilities, on an undiscounted basis.\n(4)\nPurchase obligations for inventory and production costs (such as raw materials, electonic devices, indirect materials and supplies, packaging, co-manufacturing arrangements, storage and distribution) are commitments for projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business. Other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing, advertising, capital expenditures, information technology and professional services.  Other purchase obligations also include the expected future contributions to the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World.  For further details see\nBusiness Environment\n—\nOther Developments\n.  Arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction. Amounts represent the minimum commitments under non-cancelable contracts. Any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above.\n(5)\nOther long-term liabilities consist primarily of transition tax (as discussed in Item 8, Note 11.\nIncome Taxes\nto our consolidated financial statements), postretirement health care costs, accruals established for employment costs and accruals established for Exit activities (for further details, see Note 19.\nAsset impairment and Exit Costs\n). The following long-term liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the table above: accrued pension and postemployment costs, tax contingencies, insurance accruals and other accruals. We are unable to estimate the timing of payments (or contributions in the case of accrued pension costs) for these items. Currently, we anticipate making pension contributions of approximately $262 million in 2021, based on current tax and benefit laws (as discussed in Item 8, Note 13.\nBenefit Plans\nto our consolidated financial statements).\nEquity and Dividends\nWe discuss our stock awards as of December 31, 2020, in Item 8, Note 9.\nStock Plans\nto our consolidated financial statements.\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, we did not repurchase any shares under a share repurchase program.\nDividends paid in 2020 were $7.4 billion.  During the third quarter of 2020, our Board of Directors approved a 2.6% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.20 per common share.  As a result, the present annualized dividend rate is $4.80 per common share.\nMarket Risk\nCounterparty Risk -\nWe predominantly work with financial institutions with strong short- and long-term credit ratings as assigned by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. These banks are also part of a defined group of relationship banks. Non-investment grade institutions are only used in certain emerging markets to the extent required by local business needs. We have a conservative approach when it comes to choosing financial counterparties and financial instruments. As such we do not invest or hold investments in any structured or equity-linked products. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents is currently invested with maturities of less than 30 days.\nWe continuously monitor and assess the credit worthiness of all our counterparties.\n56\nDerivative Financial Instruments -\nWe operate in markets outside of the United States of America, with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations throughout the world.  Consequently, we use certain financial instruments to manage our foreign currency and interest rate exposure.  We use derivative financial instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures.  We are not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nSee Item 8, Note 15.\nFinancial Instruments\nto our consolidated financial statements for further details on our derivative financial instruments and the related collateral arrangements.\nValue at Risk\n-\nWe use a value at risk computation to estimate the potential one-day loss in the fair value of our interest-rate-sensitive and foreign currency price-sensitive derivative financial instruments. This computation includes our debt and foreign currency forwards, swaps and options. Anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the foregoing instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the computation.\nThe computation estimates were made assuming normal market conditions, using a 95% confidence interval and a one-day holding period using a \"parametric delta-gamma\" approximation technique to determine the observed interrelationships between movements in interest rates and various currencies and in calculating the risk of the underlying positions in the portfolio.  These interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate and forward currency rate movements primarily over the preceding quarter for determining value at risk at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and primarily over each of the four preceding quarters for the calculation of average, high and low value at risk amounts during each year.\nThe significant year-over-year increase in \"average\" and \"high\" impact on the value at risk computation above was primarily due to an increase in interest rate and foreign currency volatility during the first quarter of 2020 resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe value at risk computation is a risk analysis tool designed to statistically estimate the maximum probable daily loss from adverse movements in interest and foreign currency rates under normal market conditions. The computation does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value or earnings to be incurred by us, nor does it consider the effect of favorable changes in market rates. We cannot predict actual future movements in such market rates and do not present these results to be indicative of future movements in market rates or to be representative of any actual impact that future changes in market rates may have on our future results of operations or financial position.\nContingencies\nSee Item 3 and Item 8, Note 17.\nContingencies\nto our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of contingencies.\n57\nCautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\nWe may from time to time make written or oral forward-looking statements, including statements contained in filings with the SEC, in reports to stockholders and in press releases and investor webcasts. You can identify these forward-looking statements by use of words such as \"strategy,\" \"expects,\" \"continues,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"will,\" \"estimates,\" \"intends,\" \"projects,\" \"aims,\" \"goals,\" \"targets\" and other words of similar meaning. You can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.\nWe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Our RRPs constitute a new product category in its early stages that is less predictable than our mature cigarette business.  Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. Investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward-looking statements and whether to invest in or remain invested in our securities. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us; any such statement is qualified by reference to the following cautionary statements. We elaborate on these and other risks we face throughout this document, particularly in Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nand\nBusiness Environment\nof this section. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider this discussion of potential risks or uncertainties to be complete. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time, except in the normal course of our public disclosure obligations."

In additio\nn, PMI ships versions o\nf its Platform 1\ndevice and its consumables authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") to Altria Group, Inc., for sale in the United States under license.  Throughout these financial statements, the term \"PMI\" refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nReduced-risk products (\"RRPs\") is the term PMI uses to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continuing smoking.  PMI has a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization.\n\"Platform 1\" is the term PMI uses to refer to PMI’s reduced-risk product that uses a precisely controlled heating device incorporating our\nIQOS HeatControl\ntechnology, into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol.\nBasis of presentation\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions include, among other things: pension and benefit plan assumptions; useful lives and valuation assumptions of goodwill and other intangible assets; valuation assumptions for non-marketable equity securities; marketing programs, and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe consolidated financial statements include PMI, as well as its wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in which PMI exercises significant influence (generally 20%-50% ownership interest) are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  Investments not accounted for under the equity method of accounting are measured at fair value, if it is readily determinable, with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  Investments without readily determinable fair values, non-marketable equity securities, are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that values the security at cost minus any impairment.  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nPMI has analyzed the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic (\"COVID-19\") on its financial statements as of December 31, 2020.  PMI has determined that the changes to its significant judgments and estimates did not have a material impact with respect to goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets or its hedge accounting activities.\nAs of March 22, 2019, PMI deconsolidated the financial results of its Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (\"RBH\") from PMI's financial statements.  For further details, see Note 20.\nDeconsolidation of RBH\n.\nCertain prior years' amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year's presentation.  The changes did not have a material impact on PMI's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any of the periods presented.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies:\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\n66\nDepreciation\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  Machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from\n3\nto\n15\nyears, and buildings and building improvements over periods up to\n40\nyears.\nEmployee benefit plans\nPMI provides a range of benefits to its employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits (primarily severance).  PMI records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified under U.S. GAAP.  PMI recognizes the funded status of its defined pension and postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets.  The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the benefit obligation.  PMI measures the plan assets and liabilities at the end of the fiscal year.  For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation.  For the postretirement health care plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.  Any plan with an overfunded status is recognized as an asset, and any plan with an underfunded status is recognized as a liability.  Any gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as a component of net periodic benefit costs are recorded as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred taxes.  PMI elects to recognize actuarial gains/(losses) using the corridor approach.\nFair value measurements\nPMI follows ASC 820,\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\nwith respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value.  The guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The guidance describes three levels of input that may be used to measure fair value.  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nForeign currency translation\nPMI translates the results of operations of its subsidiaries and affiliates using average exchange rates during each period, whereas balance sheet accounts are translated using exchange rates at the end of each period.  Currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of stockholders’ (deficit) equity.  In addition, some of PMI’s subsidiaries have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies, and to the extent those are not designated as net investment hedges, these assets and liabilities generate transaction gains and losses when translated into their respective functional currencies.\nGoodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets valuation\nPMI tests goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review.  PMI performs its annual impairment analysis in the second quarter of each year.  The impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value.  If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired.\nHedging instruments\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period either in accumulated other comprehensive losses on the consolidated balance sheet or in earnings, depending on whether a derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.  Gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive losses are reclassified to the consolidated statements of earnings, into the same line item as the impact of the underlying transaction, in the periods in which operating results are affected by the hedged item.  Cash flows from hedging instruments are classified in the same manner as the affected hedged item in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n67\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nPMI reviews long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.  PMI performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists.  For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use, PMI groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable.  If an impairment is determined to exist, any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value.  Impairment losses on assets to be disposed of, if any, are based on the estimated proceeds to be received, less costs of disposal.\nImpairment of investment in non-marketable equity securities\nNon-marketable equity securities are subject to periodic impairment reviews during which PMI considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investees' fair value.  Upon determining that an impairment may exist, the security’s fair value is calculated and compared to its carrying value, and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.  For further details see Note 20.\nDeconsolidation of RBH\n.\nImpairment of equity method investments\nEquity method investments are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss would be recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary.  PMI determines whether a loss is other than temporary by considering the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the equity investment has been less than the carrying amount, the financial condition of the equity investment, and the intent to retain the investment for a period of time is sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are provided on all earnings for jurisdictions outside the United States.  These provisions, as well as state and local income tax provisions, are determined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in PMI’s consolidated balance sheets.  Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.  PMI recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of earnings.  PMI recognizes income taxes associated with Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\"GILTI\") taxes as current period expense rather than including these amounts in the measurement of deferred taxes.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The first-in, first-out and average cost methods are used to cost substantially all inventories.  It is a generally recognized industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset, although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the aging process, ordinarily would not be utilized within one year.\nLeases\nPMI determines that a contract contains a lease if the contract conveys a right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease ter\nm with the expense recorded in cost of sales or marketing, administration and research costs depending on the nature of the leased item.  At l\nease commencement, PMI recognizes lease liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets (at the present value of future payments) for predominately all of its operating leases.  The recognition of the right-of-use asset and lease liability includes renewal options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.  Certain of PMI’s leases include payments that are based on changes to an index or on actual usage.  These lease payments are adjusted periodically and are included within variable lease costs.  PMI accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single-lease component with the exception of its vehicle leases, of which PMI accounts for the lease components separately from the nonlease components. Additionally, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not included in the right-of-use asset or lease liability on the consolidated statement of financial position.\n68\nMarketing costs\nPMI supports its products with advertising, adult consumer engagement and trade promotions.  Such programs include, but are not limited to, discounts, rebates, in-store display incentives, e-commerce, mobile and other digital platforms, adult consumer activation and promotion activities, as well as costs associated with adult consumer experience outlets and other adult consumer touchpoints and volume-based incentives.  Advertising, as well as certain consumer engagement and trade activities costs, are expensed as incurred.  Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction of revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers at the end of a period, based principally on historical utilization.  For interim reporting purposes, advertising and certain consumer engagement expenses are charged to earnings based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\nRevenue recognition\nPMI recognizes revenue primarily through the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other nicotine-containing products, including reduced-risk products. The majority of PMI revenues are generated by sales through direct and indirect distribution networks with short-term payment conditions and where control is typically transferred to the customer either upon shipment or delivery of goods.  PMI evaluates the transfer of control through evidence of the customer’s receipt and acceptance, transfer of title, PMI’s right to payment for those products and the customer’s ability to direct the use of those products upon receipt.  Typically, PMI’s performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized either upon shipment or delivery of goods.\nIn certain instances, PMI facilitates shipping and handling activities after control has transferred to the customer.  PMI has elected to record all shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill a contract.  The shipping and handling costs that have not been incurred at the time revenue is recognized are accrued.  The transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration, where applicable.  Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and is estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers, historical experience of discount or rebate redemption, where relevant, and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs, which may change from time to time as the business and product categories evolve.  PMI has elected to exclude excise taxes collected from customers from the measurement of the transaction price, thereby presenting revenues net of excise taxes.  Estimated costs associated with warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized.\nStock-based compensation\nPMI measures compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognizes the compensation costs over the service periods for awards expected to vest.  PMI’s accounting policy is to estimate the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjust the expense when it is no longer probable that the employee will fulfill the service condition.  For further details, see Note 9.\nStock Plans\n.\n69\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net:\nThe movements in goodwill were as follows:\nAt December 31, 2020, goodwill primarily reflects PMI’s acquisitions in Colombia, Greece, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan and Serbia, as well as the business combination in the Philippines.\nFor details on the deconsolidation of RBH, see Note 20.\nDeconsolidation of RBH\n.\nDetails of other intangible assets were as follows:\n* Primarily includes intellectual property rights\nNon-amortizable intangible assets substantially consist of trademarks from PMI’s acquisitions in Indonesia and Mexico.  The decrease since December 31, 2019, was due to currency movements of $(\n30\n) million.\nThe increase in the gross carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets from December 31, 2019, was mainly due to currency movements of $\n15\nmillion.\nThe change in the accumulated amortization from December 31, 2019 was mainly due to the 2020 amortization of $\n73\nmillion, combined with currency movements of $\n7\nmillion.\nAmortization expense for each of the next five years is estimated to be $\n72\nmillion or less, assuming no additional transactions occur that require the amortization of intangible assets.\n70\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, PMI completed its annual review of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment, and\nno\nimpairment charges were required as a result of this review.\nRelated Parties - Equity Investments and Other:\nEquity Method Investments:\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, PMI had total equity method investments of $\n966\nmillion and $\n1,053\nmillion, respectively.  Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost.  Under the equity method of accounting, the investment is adjusted for PMI's proportionate share of earnings or losses, dividends, capital contributions, changes in ownership interests and movements in currency translation adjustments.  The carrying value of our equity method investments at December 31, 2020 and 2019, exceeded our share of the investees' book value by $\n773\nmillion and $\n901\nmillion, respectively.  The difference between the investment carrying value and the amount of underlying equity in net assets, excluding $\n745\nmillion and $\n863\nmillion attributable to goodwill as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the underlying assets' estimated useful lives of\n10\nto\n20\nyears.  At December 31, 2020 and 2019, PMI received year-to-date dividends from equity method investees of $\n79\nmillion and $\n100\nmillion, respectively.\nPMI holds a\n23\n% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution BV, the holding company of CJSC TK Megapolis, PMI's distributor in Russia (Eastern Europe segment).\nPMI holds a\n49\n% equity interest in United Arab Emirates-based Emirati Investors-TA (FZC) (“EITA”).  PMI holds an approximate\n25\n% economic interest in Société des Tabacs Algéro-Emiratie (“STAEM”), an Algerian joint venture that is\n51\n% owned by EITA and\n49\n% by the Algerian state-owned enterprise Management et Développement des Actifs et des Ressources Holding (\"MADAR Holding\"), which is part of the Middle East & Africa segment, manufactures and distributes under license some of PMI’s brands.\nThe initial investments in Megapolis Distribution BV and EITA were recorded at cost and are included in equity investments on the consolidated balance sheets.\nEquity securities:\nFollowing the deconsolidation of RBH on March 22, 2019, PMI recorded the continuing investment in RBH, PMI's wholly owned subsidiary in Canada, at fair value of $\n3,280\nmillion at the date of deconsolidation, within equity investments.  For further details, see Note 20.\nDeconsolidation of RBH\n.  Transactions between PMI and RBH are considered to be related-party transactions from the date of deconsolidation and are included in the tables below.\nThe fair value of PMI’s other equity securities, which have been classified within Level 1, was $\n256\nmillion and $\n332\nmillion for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Unrealized pre-tax gain (loss) of $(\n76\n) million and $\n44\nmillion ($(\n60\n) million and $\n35\nmillion net of tax) on these equity securities was recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  For a description of the fair value hierarchy and the three levels of inputs used to measure fair values, see Note 2\n. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n.\nOther related parties:\nUnited Arab Emirates-based Trans-Emirates Trading and Investments (FZC) (\"TTI\") holds a\n33\n% non-controlling interest in Philip Morris Misr LLC (\"PMM\"), an entity incorporated in Egypt which is consolidated in PMI’s financial statements in the Middle East & Africa segment. PMM sells, under license, PMI brands in Egypt through an exclusive distribution agreement with a local entity that is also controlled by TTI.\nGodfrey Phillips India Ltd (\"GPI\") is one of the non-controlling interest holders in IPM India, which is a\n56.3\n% owned PMI consolidated subsidiary in the South & Southeast Asia segment.  GPI also acts as contract manufacturer and distributor for IPM India.  Amounts in the tables below include transactions between these related parties.\n71\nFinancial activity with the above related parties:\nPMI’s net revenues and expenses with the above related parties were as follows:\n(a)\nNet revenues exclude excise taxes and VAT billed to customers.\nPMI’s balance sheet activity with the above related parties was as follows:\nThe activities with the above related parties are in the ordinary course of business, and are primarily for distribution, service fees, contract manufacturing and license agreements.  PMI eliminated its respective share of all significant intercompany transactions with the equity method investees.\nProduct Warranty:\nPMI's\nIQOS\ndevices are subject to standard product warranties generally for a period of\n12\nmonths from the date of purchase or such other periods as required by law.  PMI generally provides in cost of sales for the estimated cost of warranty in the period the related revenue is recognized.  PMI assesses the adequacy of its accrued product warranties and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.  Factors that affect product warranties may vary across markets but typically include device version mix, product failure rates, logistics and service delivery costs, and warranty policies.  PMI accounts for its product warranties within other accrued liabilities.\nAt December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, these amounts were as follows:\n72\nAcquisitions:\nOn March 21, 2018, PMI acquired the remaining\n49\n% interest in Tabacalera Costarricense, S.A. and Mendiola y Compañía, S.A. for a net purchase price of $\n95\nmillion, which included $\n2\nmillion of contingent consideration.  As a result, PMI now owns\n100\n% of these Costa Rican affiliates.  The purchase of the remaining\n49\n% interest resulted in a decrease to PMI’s additional paid-in capital of $\n86\nmillion.\nIndebtedness:\nShort-Term Borrowings\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, PMI’s short-term borrowings and related average interest rates consisted of the following:\nGiven the mix of subsidiaries and their respective local economic environments, the average interest rate for bank loans above can vary significantly from day to day and country to country.\nThe fair values of PMI’s short-term borrowings at December 31, 2020 and 2019, based upon current market interest rates, approximate the amounts disclosed above.\n73\nLong-Term Debt\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, PMI’s long-term debt consisted of the following:\n(a)\nIncludes mortgage debt in Switzerland as well as $\n37\nmillion and $\n56\nmillion in finance leases at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe fair value of PMI’s outstanding long-term debt, which is utilized solely for disclosure purposes, is determined using quotes and market interest rates currently available to PMI for issuances of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019 the fair value of PMI's outstanding long-term debt, excluding the aforementioned finance leases, was as follows:\nFor a description of the fair value hierarchy and the three levels of inputs used to measure fair values, see Note 2\n. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n.\nDebt Issuances Outstanding:\nPMI’s debt issuances outstanding at December 31, 2020, were as follows:\n74\n75\n(a)\nThese notes are a further issuance of the\n4.250\n% notes issued by PMI in November 2014.\n(b)\nUSD equivalents for foreign currency notes were calculated based on exchange rates on the date of issuance.\nThe net proceeds from the sale of the securities listed in the table above were used for general corporate purposes, including working capital requirements and repurchase of PMI's common stock until 2015.\nOn January 25, 2021, PMI redeemed all of its outstanding\n1.875\n% U.S. dollar notes due February 25, 2021.  As of December 31, 2020, $\n750\nmillion aggregate principal amount of the U.S. dollar notes were outstanding.  The pre-tax loss related to this debt extinguishment, which was not material, will be included in Interest expense, net on PMI’s condensed consolidated statements of earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2021.\nAggregate maturities:\nAggregate maturities of long-term debt are as follows:\nCredit Facilities\nAt December 31, 2020, PMI’s total committed credit facilities were as follows:\nAt December 31, 2020, there were\nno\nborrowings under these committed credit facilities, and the entire committed amounts were available for borrowing.\nThese facilities do not include any credit rating triggers, material adverse change clauses or any provisions that could require PMI to post collateral.  The $\n3.5\nbillion multi-year revolving credit facility in the table above requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“consolidated EBITDA”) to consolidated interest expense of not less than\n3.5\nto 1.0 on a rolling four-quarter basis.  At December 31, 2020, PMI’s ratio calculated in accordance with the agreement was\n12.6\nto 1.0.  PMI expects to continue to meet PMI's covenants.  The terms “consolidated EBITDA” and “consolidated interest expense,” both of which include certain adjustments, are defined in the facility agreements previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n76\nOn January 29, 2021, PMI entered into an agreement to amend and extend the term of its\n364\n-day revolving credit facility from February 2, 2021, to February 1, 2022 in the amount o\nf $\n1.75\nbillion.\nOn January 29, 2021, PMI also entered into an agreement, effective February 10, 2021, to amend and extend the term of its $\n2.0\nbillion multi-year revolving credit facility, for an additional year covering the period February 11, 2025 to February 10, 2026, in the amount of $\n1.86\nbillion.\nIn addition to the committed credit facilities discussed above, certain subsidiaries maintain short-term credit arrangements to meet their respective working capital needs.  These credit arrangements, which amounted to approximately $\n2.7\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, are for the sole use of the subsidiaries.  Borrowings under these arrangements and other bank loans amounted to $\n244\nmillion at December 31, 2020, and $\n338\nmillion at December 31, 2019.\nCapital Stock:\nShares of authorized common stock are\n6.0\nbillion; issued, repurchased and outstanding shares were as follows:\nAt December 31, 2020,\n25,148,458\nshares of common stock were reserved for stock awards under PMI’s stock plans, and\n250\nmillion shares of preferred stock, without par value, were authorized but unissued.  PMI currently has no plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.\nStock Plans:\nIn May 2017, PMI’s shareholders approved the Philip Morris International Inc. 2017 Performance Incentive Plan (the “2017 Plan”).  Under the 2017 Plan, PMI may grant to eligible employees restricted shares and restricted share units, performance-based cash incentive awards and performance-based equity awards.  Up to\n25\nmillion shares of PMI’s common stock may be issued under the 2017 Plan.  At December 31, 2020, shares available for grant under the 2017 Plan were\n17,293,960\n.\nIn May 2017, PMI’s shareholders also approved the Philip Morris International Inc. 2017 Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the “2017 Non-Employee Directors Plan”).  A non-employee director is defined as a member of the PMI Board of Directors who is not a full-time employee of PMI or of any corporation in which PMI owns, directly or indirectly, stock possessing at least\n50\n% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote in the election of directors in such corporation.  Up to\n1\nmillion shares of PMI common stock may be awarded under the 2017 Non-Employee Directors Plan.  At December 31, 2020, shares available for grant under the plan were\n933,338\n.\n77\nRestricted share unit (RSU) awards\nPMI may grant RSU awards to eligible employees; recipients may not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber such awards.  Such awards are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met.  RSU awards generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date.  RSU awards do not carry voting rights, although they do earn dividend equivalents.\nDuring 2020, the activity for RSU awards was as follows:\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the grant date fair value of the RSU awards granted to PMI employees and the recorded compensation expense related to RSU awards were as follows:\nThe fair value of the RSU awards at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the restriction period, typically\nthree years\nafter the date of the award, or upon death, disability or reaching the age of\n58\n.  As of December 31, 2020, PMI had $\n133\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested RSU awards. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of  approximately\ntwo years\n, or upon death, disability or reaching the age of\n58\n.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, share and fair value information for PMI RSU awards that vested were as follows:\n78\nPerformance share unit (PSU) awards\nPMI may grant PSU awards to certain executives; recipients may not sell, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber such awards.  The PSU awards require the achievement of certain performance factors, which are predetermined at the time of grant, typically over a\nthree-year\nperformance cycle.  The performance metrics for such PSU's granted during the 2020 consisted of PMI's Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") relative to a predetermined peer group and on an absolute basis (\n40\n% weight), PMI’s currency-neutral compound annual adjusted diluted earnings per share growth rate (\n30\n% weight), and PMI’s performance against specific measures of PMI’s transformation, defined as net revenues from PMI's RRPs and any other non-combustible products as a percentage of PMI's total net revenues in the last year of the performance cycle (\n30\n% weight).  The performance metrics for such PSUs granted during the years ended 2019 and 2018 consisted of PMI’s TSR relative to a predetermined peer group and on an absolute basis (\n50\n% weight), PMI’s currency-neutral compound annual adjusted operating income growth rate, excluding acquisitions (\n30\n% weight), and PMI’s performance against specific measures of PMI’s transformation (\n20\n% weight).\nThe aggregate of the weighted performance factors for the\nthree\nmetrics in each such PSU award determines the percentage of PSUs that will vest at the end of the\nthree-year\nperformance cycle.  The minimum percentage of such PSUs that can vest is\nzero\n, with a target percentage of\n100\nand a maximum percentage of\n200\n.  Each such vested PSU entitles the participant to\none\nshare of common stock.  An aggregate weighted PSU performance factor of\n100\nwill result in the targeted number of PSUs being vested.  At the end of the performance cycle, participants are entitled to an amount equivalent to the accumulated dividends paid on common stock during the performance cycle for the number of shares earned.  PSU awards do not carry voting rights.\nDuring 2020, the activity for PSU awards was as follows:\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the grant date fair value of the PSU awards granted to PMI employees and the recorded compensation expense related to PSU awards were as follows:\nThe grant date fair value of the PSU awards subject to the other performance factors was determined by using the average of the high and low market price of PMI’s stock at the date of the grant.  The grant date fair value of the PSU market-based awards subject to the TSR performance factor was determined by using the Monte Carlo simulation model.\nThe following assumptions were used to determine the grant date fair value of the PSU awards subject to the TSR performance factor for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n79\n(a)\nBased on the U.S. Treasury yield curve.\n(b)\nDetermined using the observed historical volatility.\n(c)\nDetermined using a weighted-average of historical and implied volatility.\nThe fair value of the PSU award at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the performance period, which is typically\nthree years\nafter the date of the award, or upon death, disability or reaching the age of\n58\n.   As of December 31, 2020, PMI had $\n39\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested PSU awards.  This cost is recognized over a weighted-average performance cycle period of approximately\ntwo years\n, or upon death, disability or reaching the age of\n58\n.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, share and fair value information for PMI PSU awards that vested were as follows:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, there were\nno\nPSU awards that vested.\nEarnings per Share:\nUnvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and therefore are included in PMI’s earnings per share calculation pursuant to the two-class method.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) were calculated using the following:\nFor the 2020, 2019 and 2018 computations, there were\nno\nantidilutive stock options.\n80\nIncome Taxes:\nEarnings before income taxes and provision for income taxes consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and, on December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (“U.S. COVID-19 Acts”) were signed into law in the U.S. to provide certain relief as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, governments around the world have enacted or implemented various forms of tax relief measures in response to the economic conditions in the wake of COVID-19.  As of December 31, 2020, PMI has determined that neither the U.S. COVID-19 Acts nor changes to income tax laws or regulations in other jurisdictions had a significant impact on PMI’s effective tax rate, with the exception of the corporate income tax rate reduction in Indonesia.\nOn July 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service released final and proposed regulations under the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) and other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.  PMI has analyzed these elective regulations and recorded the impact in its consolidated financial statements, as described below.\nAt December 31, 2017, PMI recorded a one-time transition tax liability on its accumulated foreign earnings, which is payable over an eight-year period beginning in 2018.  At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, $\n1.1\nbillion and $\n1.2\nbillion of PMI's remaining transition tax liability, respectively, was recorded in \"income taxes and other liabilities\" on PMI's consolidated balance sheets.\nAt December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, U.S. federal and foreign deferred income taxes have been provided on all accumulated earnings of PMI's foreign subsidiaries.\nPMI is regularly examined by tax authorities around the world and is currently under examination in a number of jurisdictions.  The U.S. federal statute of limitations remains open for the years\n2017 and onward\n.  Foreign and U.S. state jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from\nthree\nto\nfive years\n.  Years still open to examination by foreign tax authorities in major jurisdictions include Germany (2015 onward), Indonesia (2014 onward), Russia (2018 onward), Switzerland (2017 onward), and Turkey (2015 onward).\nIt is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months certain tax examinations will close, which could result in a change in unrecognized tax benefits, along with related interest and penalties.  An estimate of any possible change cannot be made at this time.\n81\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits was as follows:\nUnrecognized tax benefits and PMI’s liability for contingent income taxes, interest and penalties were as follows:\nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate was $\n62\nmillion at December 31, 2020. The remainder, if recognized, would principally affect deferred taxes.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, PMI recognized income (expense) in its consolidated statements of earnings of $(\n1\n) million, $(\n4\n) million and $\n4\nmillion, respectively, related to interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions.\nThe effective income tax rate on pre-tax earnings differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate for the following reasons for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nThe 2020 effective tax rate decreased\n1.5\npercentage points to\n21.7\n%.  The change in the effective tax rate for 2020, as compared to 2019, was favorably impacted by changes in earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction, a reduction of U.S. state tax expense, a reduction of estimated U.S. income tax liabilities for years 2018 and 2019 due to the GILTI regulations mentioned above ($\n93\nmillion) and the corporate income tax rate reduction in Indonesia, partially offset by a decrease in deductions related to foreign-derived intangible income for the years 2018 and 2019 and repatriation cost differences.\nThe 2019 effective tax rate increased\n0.3\npercentage points to\n23.2\n%.  The change in the effective tax rate for 2019, as compared to 2018, was unfavorably impacted by changes in earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction and U.S. state deferred income tax expense, partially offset by the reversal of a deferred tax liability on the unremitted earnings of PMI's Canadian subsidiary, RBH ($\n49\nmillion), a reduction in estimated U.S. federal income tax on dividend repatriation for the years 2015-2018 ($\n67\nmillion), and other repatriation cost differences.\n82\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:\nAt December 31, 2020, PMI recorded deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits of $\n351\nmillion, with varying dates of expiration, primarily after 2025, including $\n79\nmillion with an unlimited carryforward period.  At December 31, 2020, PMI has recorded a valuation allowance of $\n250\nmillion against deferred tax assets that do not meet the more-likely-than not recognition threshold.\nAt December 31, 2019, PMI recorded deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards of $\n486\nmillion, with varying dates of expiration, primarily after 2024, including $\n98\nmillion with an unlimited carryforward period.  At December 31, 2019, PMI has recorded a valuation allowance of $\n304\nmillion against deferred tax assets that do not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold.\nSegment Reporting:\nPMI’s subsidiaries and affiliates are engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and other nicotine-containing products, including RRPs, in markets outside of the United States of America.  In addition, PMI ships versions of its Platform 1\ndevice and its consumables authorized by the FDA to Altria Group, Inc. for sale in the United States under license.  Operating segments for PMI are organized by geographic region and managed by segment managers who are responsible for the operating and financial results of the regions inclusive of all product categories sold in the region.  PMI’s operating segments are the European Union; Eastern Europe; Middle East & Africa; South & Southeast Asia; East Asia & Australia; and Latin America & Canada.  PMI records net revenues and operating income to its segments based upon the geographic area in which the customer resides.  Revenues from shipments of Platform 1 devices, heated tobacco units and accessories to Altria Group, Inc. for sale under license in the United States are included in Net Revenues of the Latin America & Canada segment.\nPMI’s chief operating decision maker evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based on regional operating income, which includes results from all product categories sold in each region.  Interest expense, net, and provision for income taxes are centrally managed and, accordingly, such items are not presented by segment since they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by management.  Information about total assets by segment is not disclosed because such information is not reported to or used by PMI’s chief operating decision maker.  Segment goodwill and other intangible assets, net, are disclosed in Note\n83\n3.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net.\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nPMI disaggregates its net revenue from contracts with customers by both geographic location and product category for each of PMI's\nsix\noperating segments, as PMI believes this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nNet revenues by segment were as follows:\nTotal net revenues attributable to customers located in Japan, PMI's largest market in terms of net revenues, were $\n4.1\nbillion, $\n3.9\nbillion and $\n3.8\nbillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  PMI had one customer in the East Asia & Australia segment that accounted for\n14\n%,\n13\n% and\n13\n% of PMI’s consolidated net revenues, and one customer in the European Union segment that accounted for\n11\n%,\n10\n% and\n10\n% of PMI’s consolidated net revenues in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nPMI's net revenues by product category were as follows:\nNote: Sum of product categories or Regions might not foot to total PMI due to roundings.\nNet revenues related to combustible products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes.  These net revenue amounts consist of the sale of PMI's cigarettes and other tobacco products combined.  Other tobacco products primarily include roll-your-own and make-your-own cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and cigarillos and do not include reduced-risk products.\n84\nNet revenues related to reduced-risk products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes. These net revenue amounts consist of the sale of PMI's heated tobacco units, heat-not-burn devices and related accessories, and other nicotine-containing products, which primarily include PMI's e-vapor products.\nOperating income by segment were as follows:\nItems affecting the comparability of results from operations were as follows:\n•\nAsset impairment and exit costs\n- See Note 19.\nAsset Impairment and Exit Costs\nfor details of the $\n149\nmillion and $\n422\nmillion pre-tax charges for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as well as a breakdown of these costs by segment.\n•\nRussia excise and VAT audit charge\n- See Note 17.\nContingencies\nfor details of the $\n374\nmillion pre-tax charge included in the Eastern Europe segment for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n•\nCanadian tobacco litigation-related expense\n- See Note 17.\nContingencies\nand Note 20.\nDeconsolidation of RBH\nfor details of the $\n194\nmillion pre-tax charge included in the Latin America & Canada segment for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n•\nLoss on deconsolidation of RBH\n- See Note 20.\nDeconsolidation of RBH\nfor details of the $\n239\nmillion loss included in the Latin America & Canada segment for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n•\nBrazil indirect tax credit\n- Following a final and enforceable decision by the highest court in Brazil in October 2020, PMI recorded a gain of $\n119\nmillion for tax credits representing overpayments of indirect taxes for the period from March 2012 through December 2019; these tax credits will be applied to future tax liabilities in Brazil.  This amount was included as a reduction in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2020 and was included in the operating income of the Latin America & Canada segment.  A decision regarding an additional amount of overpaid indirect taxes of approximately $\n90\nmillion is still pending before this court.\nOther segment data were as follows:\n85\nLong-lived assets consist of non-current assets other than goodwill; other intangible assets, net; deferred tax assets, equity investments, and financial instruments.  PMI's largest markets in terms of long-lived assets are Switzerland, Italy and Indonesia.  Total long-lived assets located in Switzerland, which is reflected in the European Union segment above, were $\n1.3\nbillion, $\n1.1\nbillion and $\n1.0\nbillion at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Total long-lived assets located in Italy, which is reflected in the European Union segment above, were $\n1.1\nbillion, $\n1.1\nbillion and $\n1.1\nbillion at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Total long-lived assets located in Indonesia, which is reflected in the South & Southeast Asia segment above, were $\n0.7\nbillion, $\n0.8\nbillion and $\n0.7\nbillion at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nBenefit Plans:\nPension coverage for employees of PMI’s subsidiaries is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans, many of which are governed by local statutory requirements.  In addition, PMI provides health care and other benefits to substantially all U.S. retired employees and certain non-U.S. retired employees.  In general, health care benefits for non-U.S. retired employees are covered through local government plans.\nPension and other employee benefit costs per the consolidated statements of earnings consisted of the following for December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n86\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nObligations and Funded Status\nThe postretirement health care plans are not funded.\nThe projected benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of PMI’s pension plans, and the accumulated benefit obligation and net amount accrued for PMI's postretirement health care plans, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, were as follows:\n(1)  Primarily non-U.S. based defined benefit retirement plans.\n(2) Certain prior years' amounts pertaining to PMI’s pension plans have been reclassified in the table above to conform with the current year's presentation.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, actuarial losses (gains) consisted primarily of losses for assumption changes related to lower discount rates year-over-year for Swiss, German and Dutch plans.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Swiss pension plan represented\n63\n% and\n62\n% of the benefit obligation, respectively, and approximately\n59\n% and\n59\n% of the fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the U.S. pension plan represented\n4\n% and\n4\n% of the benefit obligation, respectively, and approximately\n4\n% and\n4\n% of the fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n87\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amounts recognized on PMI's consolidated balance sheets for the pension and postretirement plans were as follows:\nThe accumulated benefit obligation, which represents benefits earned to date, for the pension plans was $\n11.5\nbillion and $\n10.0\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFor pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $\n10.5\nbillion and $\n7.7\nbillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.  The accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $\n9.0\nbillion and $\n6.8\nbillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.\nFor pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, the projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $\n12.1\nbillion and $\n8.6\nbillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.  The projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $\n10.4\nbillion and $\n7.7\nbillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2019.\nThe following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine PMI’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations at December 31:\nThe discount rate for the largest pension plans is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that produces a cash flow pattern equivalent to each plan’s expected benefit payments.  The discount rate for the remaining plans is developed from local bond indices that match local benefit obligations as closely as possible.\n88\nComponents of Net Periodic Benefit Cost\nNet periodic pension and postretirement health care costs consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nSettlement and curtailment charges were due primarily to employee severance and early retirement programs.\nThe following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine PMI’s net pension and postretirement health care costs:\nPMI’s expected rate of return on pension plan assets is determined by the plan assets’ historical long-term investment performance, current asset allocation and estimates of future long-term returns by asset class.\nPMI and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution plans.  Amounts charged to expense for defined contribution plans totaled $\n66\nmillion, $\n63\nmillion and $\n66\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nPlan Assets\nPMI’s investment strategy for pension plans is based on an expectation that equity securities will outperform debt securities over the long term.  Accordingly, the target allocation of PMI’s plan assets is broadly characterized as approximately\n60\n% in equity securities and approximately\n40\n% in debt securities and other assets. The strategy primarily utilizes indexed U.S. equity securities, international equity securities and investment-grade debt securities.  PMI’s plans have no investments in hedge funds, private equity or derivatives.  PMI attempts to mitigate investment risk by rebalancing between equity and debt asset classes once a year or as PMI’s contributions and benefit payments are made.\n89\nThe fair value of PMI’s pension plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, by asset category was as follows:\n(a)\nInvestment funds whose objective seeks to replicate the returns and characteristics of specified market indices (primarily MSCI — Europe, Switzerland, North America, Asia Pacific, Japan; Russell 3000; S&P 500 for equities, and Citigroup EMU and JP Morgan EMBI for bonds), primarily consist of mutual funds, common trust funds and commingled funds.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n.\nPMI makes, and plans to make, contributions to the extent that they are tax deductible and to meet specific funding requirements of its funded pension plans.  Currently, PMI anticipates making contributions of approximately $\n262\nmillion in 2021 to its pension plans, based on current tax and benefit laws. However, this estimate is subject to change as a result of changes in tax and other benefit laws, as well as asset performance significantly above or below the assumed long-term rate of return on pension assets, or changes in interest and currency rates.\nThe estimated future benefit payments from PMI pension plans at December 31, 2020, are as follows:\nPMI's expected future annual benefit payments for its postretirement health care plans are estimated to be not material through 2030.\nPostemployment Benefit Plans\nPMI and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor postemployment benefit plans covering substantially all salaried and certain hourly employees. The cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working life of the covered employees.  Net postemployment costs were $\n208\nmillion, $\n171\nmillion and $\n158\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe amounts recognized in accrued postemployment costs net of plan assets on PMI's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, were $\n923\nmillion and $\n751\nmillion, respectively. The change in the liability is primarily due to actuarial losses of $\n142\nmillion in 2020 resulting from increased employee severance payout primarily in countries in the European Union and Latin America & Canada segments, coupled with the periodic expense, partially offset by cash payments.\nThe accrued postemployment costs were determined using a weighted-average discount rate of\n3.0\n% and\n3.0\n% in 2020 and 2019, respectively; an assumed ultimate annual weighted-average turnover rate of\n3.0\n% and\n3.0\n% in 2020 and 2019, respectively; assumed compensation cost increases of\n2.1\n% in 2020 and\n2.6\n% in 2019, and assumed benefits as defined in the respective plans.  In accordance with local regulations, certain postemployment plans are funded.  As a result, the accrued postemployment costs disclosed above are presented net of the related assets of $\n46\nmillion and $\n40\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Postemployment costs arising from actions that offer employees benefits in excess of those specified in the respective plans are charged to expense when incurred.\nComprehensive Earnings (Losses)\nThe amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses at December 31, 2020, consisted of the following:\n91\nThe amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses at December 31, 2019, consisted of the following:\nThe amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive losses at December 31, 2018, consisted of the following:\nThe movements in other comprehensive earnings (losses) during the year ended December 31, 2020, were as follows:\n92\nThe movements in other comprehensive earnings (losses) during the year ended December 31, 2019, were as follows:\nThe movements in other comprehensive earnings (losses) during the year ended December 31, 2018, were as follows:\n93\nAdditional Information:\n(1)\nFor additional information on total lease costs, see Note 21.\nLeases.\nFinancial Instruments:\nOverview\nPMI operates in markets outside of the United States of America, with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations around the world.  PMI utilizes certain financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate exposure.  Derivative financial instruments are used by PMI principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures.  PMI is not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  Substantially all of PMI's derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting arrangements, whereby the right to offset occurs in the event of default by a participating party.  While these contracts contain the enforceable right to offset through close-out netting rights, PMI elects to present them on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheets.  Collateral associated with these arrangements is in the form of cash and is unrestricted.  Financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at inception and throughout the hedged period.  PMI formally documents the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of assessing hedge effectiveness.  Additionally, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur.  If it were deemed probable that the forecasted transaction would not occur, the gain or loss would be recognized in earnings.\nPMI uses deliverable and non-deliverable forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and foreign currency options, collectively referred to as foreign exchange contracts (\"foreign exchange contracts\"), and interest rate contracts to mitigate its exposure to changes in exchange and interest rates from third-party and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions.  Both foreign exchange contracts and interest rate contracts are collectively referred to as derivative contracts (\"derivative contracts\").  The primary currencies to which PMI is exposed include the Euro, Indonesian rupiah, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Philippine peso, Russian ruble and Swiss franc.  At December 31, 2020 and 2019, PMI had contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $\n26.5\nbillion and $\n24.1\nbillion, respectively.  Of the $\n26.5\nbillion aggregate notional amount at December 31, 2020, $\n5.0\nbillion related to cash flow hedges, $\n8.9\nbillion related to hedges of net investments in foreign operations and $\n12.6\nbillion related to other derivatives that primarily offset currency exposures on intercompany financing.  Of the $\n24.1\nbillion aggregate notional amount at December 31, 2019, $\n2.8\nbillion related to cash flow hedges, $\n9.9\nbillion related to hedges of net investments in foreign operations and $\n11.4\nbillion related to other derivatives that primarily offset currency exposures on intercompany financing.\n94\nThe fair value of PMI’s derivative contracts included in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, were as follows:\nPMI assesses the fair value of its foreign exchange contracts and interest rate contracts using standard valuation models that use, as their basis, readily observable market inputs.  The fair value of PMI’s foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency swaps and interest rate contracts is determined by using the prevailing foreign exchange spot rates and interest rate differentials, and the respective maturity dates of the instruments.  The fair value of PMI’s currency options is determined by using a Black-Scholes methodology based on foreign exchange spot rates and interest rate differentials, currency volatilities and maturity dates.  PMI’s derivative contracts have been classified within Level 2 at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n95\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, PMI's derivative contracts impacted the consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive earnings as follows:\n(a)\nAmount of gains (losses) on hedges of net investments principally related to changes in exchange and interest rates between the Euro and U.S. dollar\n(b)\nRepresent the gains for amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing\n(c)\nThe gains (losses) from these contracts attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates substantially offset the (losses) and gains generated by the underlying intercompany and third-party loans being hedged\n96\nCash Flow Hedges\nPMI has entered into derivative contracts to hedge the foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks related to certain forecasted transactions.  Gains and losses associated with qualifying cash flow hedge contracts are deferred as components of accumulated other comprehensive losses until the underlying hedged transactions are reported in PMI’s consolidated statements of earnings.  As of December 31, 2020, PMI has hedged forecasted transactions for periods not exceeding the next\neighteen months\n, with the exception of one derivative contract that expires in May 2024.  The impact of these hedges is primarily included in operating cash flows on PMI’s consolidated statements of cash flows.\nHedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations\nPMI designates derivative contracts and certain foreign currency denominated debt instruments as net investment hedges, primarily of its Euro net assets.  The amount of pre-tax gain/(loss) related to these debt instruments, that was reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive losses within currency translation adjustment, was $(\n465\n) million\n, $\n234\nmillion and $\n349\nmillion, for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The premiums paid for, and settlements of, net investment hedges are included in investing cash flows on PMI’s consolidated statements of cash flows.\nOther Derivatives\nPMI has entered into derivative contracts to hedge the foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks related to intercompany loans between certain subsidiaries, and third-party loans.  While effective as economic hedges, no hedge accounting is applied for these contracts; therefore, the gains (losses) relating to these contracts are reported in PMI’s consolidated statements of earnings.\nQualifying Hedging Activities Reported in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses\nDerivative gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive losses are a result of qualifying hedging activity.  Transfers of these gains or losses to earnings are offset by the corresponding gains or losses on the underlying hedged item.\nHedging activity affected accumulated other comprehensive losses, net of income taxes, as follows:\nAt December 31, 2020, PMI expects $(\n49\n) million of derivative losses that are included in accumulated other comprehensive losses to be reclassified to the consolidated statement of earnings within the next 12 months.  These losses are expected to be substantially offset by the statement of earnings impact of the respective hedged transactions.\nContingent Features\nPMI’s derivative instruments do not contain contingent features.\nCredit Exposure and Credit Risk\nPMI is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties.  While PMI does not anticipate non-performance, its risk is limited to the fair value of the financial instruments less any cash collateral received or pledged.  PMI actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits and by selecting and continuously monitoring a diverse group of major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties.\n97\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Losses:\nPMI's accumulated other comprehensive losses, net of taxes, consisted of the following:\nReclassifications from Other Comprehensive Earnings\nThe movements in accumulated other comprehensive losses and the related tax impact, for each of the components above, that are due to current period activity and reclassifications to the income statement, including those related to the deconsolidation of RBH, are shown on the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. For additional information, see Note 13.\nBenefit Plans\nfor disclosures related to PMI's pension and other benefits, Note 15.\nFinancial Instruments\nfor disclosures related to derivative financial instruments and Note 20.\nDeconsolidation of RBH\nfor disclosures related to the deconsolidation of RBH.\nContingencies:\nTobacco-Related Litigation\nLegal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened against us, and/or our subsidiaries, and/or our indemnitees in various jurisdictions. Our indemnitees include distributors, licensees, and others that have been named as parties in certain cases and that we have agreed to defend, as well as to pay costs and some or all of judgments, if any, that may be entered against them. Pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement between Altria Group, Inc. (\"Altria\") and PMI, PMI will indemnify Altria and Philip Morris USA Inc. (\"PM USA\"), a U.S. tobacco subsidiary of Altria, for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by PMI or contract manufactured for PMI by PM USA, and PM USA will indemnify PMI for tobacco product claims based in substantial part on products manufactured by PM USA, excluding tobacco products contract manufactured for PMI.\nIt is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases against us and our subsidiaries. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation.\nDamages claimed in some of the tobacco-related litigation are significant and, in certain cases in Brazil, Canada and Nigeria, range into the billions of U.S. dollars. The variability in pleadings in multiple jurisdictions, together with the actual experience of management in litigating claims, demonstrate that the monetary relief that may be specified in a lawsuit bears little relevance to the ultimate outcome. Much of the tobacco-related litigation is in its early stages, and litigation is subject to uncertainty. However, as discussed below, we have to date been largely successful in defending tobacco-related litigation.\nWe and our subsidiaries record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, except as stated otherwise in this Note 17.\nContingencies,\nwhile it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, after assessing the information available to it (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending tobacco-related cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending tobacco-related cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any. Legal defense costs are expensed as incurred.\n98\nIt is possible that our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation. Nevertheless, although litigation is subject to uncertainty, we and each of our subsidiaries named as a defendant believe, and each has been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases, that we have valid defenses to the litigation pending against us, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts. All such cases are, and will continue to be, vigorously defended. However, we and our subsidiaries may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests to do so.\nCCAA Proceedings and Stay of Tobacco-Related Cases Pending in Canada\nAs a result of the Court of Appeal of Quebec’s decision in both the\nLétourneau\nand\nBlais\ncases described below, our subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (“RBH”), and the other defendants, JTI Macdonald Corp., and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited, sought protection in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (“CCAA”) on March 22, March 8, and March 12, 2019 respectively.  CCAA is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course.  The initial CCAA order made by the Ontario Superior Court on March 22, 2019 authorizes RBH to pay all expenses incurred in carrying on its business in the ordinary course after the CCAA filing, including obligations to employees, vendors, and suppliers.  As further described in Note 20.\nDeconsolidation of RBH\n, RBH is now deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements. As part of the CCAA proceedings, there is currently a comprehensive stay up to and including March 31, 2021 of all tobacco-related litigation pending in Canada against RBH and the other defendants, including PMI and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), namely, the smoking and health class actions filed in various Canadian provinces and health care cost recovery actions.  These proceedings are presented below under the caption “\nStayed Litigation — Canada\n.” Ernst & Young Inc. has been appointed as monitor of RBH in the CCAA proceedings.  In accordance with the CCAA process, as the parties work towards a plan of arrangement or compromise in a confidential mediation, it is anticipated that the court will set additional hearings and further extend the stay of proceedings. On April 17, 2019, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that RBH and the other defendants will not be allowed to file an application to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the Court of Appeal’s decision in the\nLétourneau\nand the\nBlais\ncases so long as the comprehensive stay of all tobacco-related litigation in Canada remains in effect and that the time period to file the application would be extended by the stay period. While RBH believes that the findings of liability and damages in both\nLétourneau\nand the\nBlais\ncases were incorrect, the CCAA proceedings will provide a forum for RBH to seek resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all tobacco-related litigation pending in Canada.  It is not possible to predict the resolution of the underlying legal proceedings or the length of the CCAA process.\n99\nStayed Litigation — Canada\nSmoking and Health Litigation — Canada\nIn the first class action pending in Canada,\nConseil Québécois Sur Le Tabac Et La Santé and Jean-Yves Blais v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd.,\nRothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. and JTI-Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada\n, filed in November 1998, RBH and other Canadian manufacturers (Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. and JTI-Macdonald Corp.) are defendants. The plaintiffs, an anti-smoking organization and an individual smoker, sought compensatory and punitive damages for each member of the class who allegedly suffers from certain smoking-related diseases. The class was certified in 2005. The trial court issued its judgment on May 27, 2015.  The trial court found RBH and\ntwo\nother Canadian manufacturers liable and found that the class members’ compensatory damages totaled approximately CAD\n15.5\nbillion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $\n12.1\nbillion). The trial court awarded compensatory damages on a joint and several liability basis, allocating\n20\n% to our subsidiary (approximately CAD\n3.1\nbillion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $\n2.4\nbillion)). In addition, the trial court awarded CAD\n90,000\n(approximately $\n70,250\n) in punitive damages, allocating CAD\n30,000\n(approximately $\n23,400\n) to RBH. The trial court estimated the disease class at\n99,957\nmembers.  RBH appealed to the Court of Appeal of Quebec. In October 2015, the Court of Appeal ordered RBH to furnish security totaling CAD\n226\nmillion (approximately $\n176.4\nmillion) to cover both the\nLétourneau\nand\nBlais\ncases, which RBH has paid in installments through March 2017.  The Court of Appeal ordered Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. to furnish security totaling CAD\n758\nmillion (approximately $\n592\nmillion) in installments through June 2017.  JTI Macdonald Corp. was not required to furnish security in accordance with plaintiffs’ motion.  The Court of Appeal ordered that the security is payable upon a final judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the trial court’s judgment or upon further order of the Court of Appeal. On March 1, 2019, the Court of Appeal issued a decision largely affirming the trial court’s findings of liability and the compensatory and punitive damages award while reducing the total amount of compensatory damages to approximately CAD\n13.5\nbillion including interest (approximately $\n10.5\nbillion) due to the trial court’s error in the calculation of interest. The compensatory damages award is on a joint and several basis with an allocation of\n20\n% to RBH (approximately CAD\n2.7\nbillion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $\n2.11\nbillion)). The Court of Appeal upheld the trial court’s findings that defendants violated the Civil Code of Quebec, the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, and the Quebec Consumer Protection Act by failing to warn adequately of the dangers of smoking and by conspiring to prevent consumers from learning of the dangers of smoking. The Court of Appeal further held that the plaintiffs either need not prove, or had adequately proven, that these faults were a cause of the class members’ injuries.  In accordance with the judgment, defendants are required to deposit their respective portions of the damages awarded in both the\nLétourneau\ncase described below and the\nBlais\ncase, approximately CAD\n1.1\nbillion (approximately $\n859\nmillion), into trust accounts within\n60\ndays.  RBH’s share of the deposit is approximately CAD\n257\nmillion (approximately $\n194\nmillion).  PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $\n194\nmillion in its consolidated results, representing $\n142\nmillion net of tax, as tobacco litigation-related expense, in the first quarter of 2019.  The charge reflects PMI’s assessment of the portion of the judgment that represents probable and estimable loss prior to the deconsolidation of RBH and corresponds to the trust account deposit required by the judgment.\nIn the second class action pending in Canada,\nCecilia Létourneau v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. and JTI-Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada,\nfiled in September 1998, RBH and other Canadian manufacturers (Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. and JTI-Macdonald Corp.) are defendants.  The plaintiff, an individual smoker, sought compensatory and punitive damages for each member of the class who is deemed addicted to smoking. The class was certified in 2005. The trial court issued its judgment on May 27, 2015.  The trial court found RBH and\ntwo\nother Canadian manufacturers liable and awarded a total of CAD\n131\nmillion (approximately $\n102.3\nmillion) in punitive damages, allocating CAD\n46\nmillion (approximately $\n36\nmillion) to RBH. The trial court estimated the size of the addiction class at\n918,000\nmembers but declined to award compensatory damages to the addiction class because the evidence did not establish the claims with sufficient accuracy.  The trial court found that a claims process to allocate the awarded punitive damages to individual class members would be too expensive and difficult to administer.  On March 1, 2019, the Court of Appeal issued a decision largely affirming the trial court’s findings of liability and the total amount of punitive damages awarded allocating CAD\n57\nmillion including interest (approximately $\n44.5\nmillion) to RBH.  See the\nBlais\ndescription above and Note 20.\nDeconsolidation of RBH\nbelow for further detail concerning the security order pertaining to both\nLétourneau\nand\nBlais\ncases and the impact of the decision on PMI’s financial statements.\nRBH and PMI believe the findings of liability and damages in both\nLétourneau\nand the\nBlais\ncases were incorrect and in contravention of applicable law on several grounds including the following: (i) defendants had no obligation to warn class members who knew, or should have known, of the risks of smoking; (ii) defendants cannot be liable to class members who would have smoked regardless of what warnings were given; and (iii) defendants cannot be liable to all class members given the individual differences between class members.\nIn the third class action pending in Canada,\nKunta v. Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council, et al., The Queen's Bench, Winnipeg, Canada\n, filed June 12, 2009, we, RBH, and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, an individual smoker, alleges her own addiction to tobacco products and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”), severe asthma, and mild reversible lung disease resulting from the use of tobacco products. She is seeking compensatory\n100\nand punitive damages on behalf of a proposed class comprised of all smokers, their estates, dependents and family members, as well as restitution of profits, and reimbursement of government health care costs allegedly caused by tobacco products.\nIn the fourth class action pending in Canada,\nAdams v. Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council, et al.,\nThe Queen's Bench, Saskatchewan, Canada\n, filed July 10, 2009, we, RBH, and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, an individual smoker, alleges her own addiction to tobacco products and COPD resulting from the use of tobacco products. She is seeking compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of a proposed class comprised of all smokers who have smoked a minimum of\n25,000\ncigarettes and have allegedly suffered, or suffer, from COPD, emphysema, heart disease, or cancer, as well as restitution of profits.\nIn the fifth class action pending in Canada,\nSemple v. Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council, et al.,\nThe Supreme Court (trial court), Nova Scotia, Canada\n, filed June 18, 2009, we, RBH, and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, an individual smoker, alleges his own addiction to tobacco products and COPD resulting from the use of tobacco products. He is seeking compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of a proposed class comprised of all smokers, their estates, dependents and family members, as well as restitution of profits, and reimbursement of government health care costs allegedly caused by tobacco products.\nIn the sixth class action pending in Canada,\nDorion v. Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council, et al., The Queen's Bench, Alberta, Canada,\nfiled June 15, 2009, we, RBH, and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, an individual smoker, alleges her own addiction to tobacco products and chronic bronchitis and severe sinus infections resulting from the use of tobacco products. She is seeking compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of a proposed class comprised of all smokers, their estates, dependents and family members, restitution of profits, and reimbursement of government health care costs allegedly caused by tobacco products. To date, we, our subsidiaries, and our indemnitees have not been properly served with the complaint.\nIn the seventh class action pending in Canada,\nMcDermid v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited, et al.,\nSupreme Court, British Columbia, Canada\n, filed June 25, 2010, we, RBH, and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, an individual smoker, alleges his own addiction to tobacco products and heart disease resulting from the use of tobacco products. He is seeking compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of a proposed class comprised of all smokers who were alive on June 12, 2007, and who suffered from heart disease allegedly caused by smoking, their estates, dependents and family members, plus disgorgement of revenues earned by the defendants from January 1, 1954, to the date the claim was filed.\nIn the eighth class action pending in Canada,\nBourassa v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited, et al.,\nSupreme Court, British Columbia, Canada\n, filed June 25, 2010, we, RBH, and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, the heir to a deceased smoker, alleges that the decedent was addicted to tobacco products and suffered from emphysema resulting from the use of tobacco products. She is seeking compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of a proposed class comprised of all smokers who were alive on June 12, 2007, and who suffered from chronic respiratory diseases allegedly caused by smoking, their estates, dependents and family members, plus disgorgement of revenues earned by the defendants from January 1, 1954, to the date the claim was filed. In December 2014, plaintiff filed an amended statement of claim.\nIn the ninth class action pending in Canada,\nSuzanne Jacklin v. Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council, et al., Ontario Superior Court of Justice,\nfiled June 20, 2012, we, RBH, and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), and other members of the industry are defendants.  The plaintiff, an individual smoker, alleges her own addiction to tobacco products and COPD resulting from the use of tobacco products. She is seeking compensatory and punitive damages on behalf of a proposed class comprised of all smokers who have smoked a minimum of\n25,000\ncigarettes and have allegedly suffered, or suffer, from COPD, heart disease, or cancer, as well as restitution of profits.\nHealth Care Cost Recovery Litigation — Canada\nIn the first health care cost recovery case pending in Canada,\nHer Majesty the Queen in Right of British Columbia v. Imperial Tobacco Limited, et al., Supreme Court, British Columbia, Vancouver Registry, Canada,\nfiled January 24, 2001, we, RBH, our indemnitee (PM USA), and other members of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, the government of the province of British Columbia, brought a claim based upon legislation enacted by the province authorizing the government to file a direct action against cigarette manufacturers to recover the health care costs it has incurred, and will incur, resulting from a “tobacco related wrong.”\nIn the second health care cost recovery case filed in Canada,\nHer Majesty the Queen in Right of New Brunswick v. Rothmans Inc., et al., Court of Queen's Bench of New Brunswick, Trial Court, New Brunswick, Fredericton, Canada,\nfiled March 13, 2008, we, RBH, our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), and other members of the industry are defendants. The claim was filed by the government of the province of New Brunswick based on legislation enacted in the province. This legislation is similar to the law introduced in British Columbia that authorizes the government to file a direct action against cigarette manufacturers to recover the health care costs it has incurred, and will incur, as a result of a “tobacco related wrong.”\n101\nIn the third health care cost recovery case filed in Canada,\nHer Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario v. Rothmans Inc., et al., Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Toronto, Canada\n, filed September 29, 2009, we, RBH, our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), and other members of the industry are defendants. The claim was filed by the government of the province of Ontario based on legislation enacted in the province. This legislation is similar to the laws introduced in British Columbia and New Brunswick that authorize the government to file a direct action against cigarette manufacturers to recover the health care costs it has incurred, and will incur, as a result of a “tobacco related wrong.”\nIn the fourth health care cost recovery case filed in Canada,\nAttorney General of Newfoundland and Labrador v. Rothmans Inc., et al., Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador, St. Johns, Canada\n, filed February 8, 2011, we, RBH, our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), and other members of the industry are defendants. The claim was filed by the government of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador based on legislation enacted in the province that is similar to the laws introduced in British Columbia, New Brunswick and Ontario. The legislation authorizes the government to file a direct action against cigarette manufacturers to recover the health care costs it has incurred, and will incur, as a result of a “tobacco related wrong.”\nIn the fifth health care cost recovery case filed in Canada,\nAttorney General of Quebec v.

Plaintiffs' allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery, including negligence, gross negligence, strict liability, fraud, misrepresentation, design defect, failure to warn, breach of express and implied warranties, violations of deceptive trade practice laws and consumer protection statutes. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief, including compensatory and other damages, and injunctive and equitable relief. Defenses raised in these cases include licit activity, failure to state a claim, lack of defect, lack of proximate cause, assumption of the risk, contributory negligence, and statute of limitations.\nAs of February 5, 2021, there were a number of smoking and health cases pending against us, our subsidiaries or indemnitees, as follows:\n•\n43\ncases brought by individual plaintiffs in Argentina (\n31\n), Brazil (\n3\n), Canada (\n2\n), Chile (\n2\n), China (\n1\n), It\naly (\n1\n), the Philippines (\n1\n), Turkey (\n1\n) and Scotland (\n1\n), compared with\n50\nsuch cases on February 3, 2020, and\n55\ncases on February 4, 2019; and\n•\n9\ncases brought on behalf of classes of individual plaintiffs in Canada, compared with\n10\nsuch cases on February 3, 2020 and\n10\nsuch cases on February 4, 2019.\nThe class actions pending in Canada are described above under the caption “\nSmoking and Health Litigation — Canada.\n”\nIn a class action in Brazil,\nThe Smoker Health Defense Association (ADESF) v. Souza Cruz, S.A. and Philip Morris Marketing, S.A., Nineteenth Lower Civil Court of the Central Courts of the Judiciary District of São Paulo, Brazil\n, filed July 25, 1995, our subsidiary and another member of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, a consumer organization, sought damages for all addicted smokers and former smokers, and injunctive relief. In 2004, the trial court found defendants liable without hearing evidence and awarded “moral damages” of R$\n1,000\n(approximately $\n186\n) per smoker per full year of smoking plus interest at the rate of\n1\n% per month, as of the date of the ruling. The court did not award actual damages, which were to be assessed in the second phase of the case. The size of the class was not estimated. Defendants appealed to the São Paulo Court of Appeals, which annulled the ruling in November 2008, finding that the trial court had inappropriately ruled without hearing evidence and returned the case to the trial court for further proceedings. In May 2011, the trial court dismissed the claim. In February 2015, the appellate court unanimously dismissed plaintiff's appeal.  In September 2015, plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court of Justice. In February 2017, the Chief Justice of the Superior Court of Justice denied plaintiff's appeal. Plaintiff filed a further appeal. In August 2020, the Superior Court of Justice confirmed the denial of plaintiff's appeal finally dismissing the plaintiff's claim.\nHealth Care Cost Recovery Litigation:\nThese cases, brought by governmental and non-governmental plaintiffs, seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products. Plaintiffs' allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery including unjust enrichment, negligence, negligent design, strict liability, breach of express and implied warranties, violation of a voluntary undertaking or special duty, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, conspiracy, public nuisance, defective product, failure to warn, sale of cigarettes to minors, and claims under statutes governing competition and deceptive trade practices. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief including compensatory and other damages, and injunctive and equitable relief. Defenses raised in these cases include lack of proximate cause, remoteness of injury, failure to state a claim, adequate\n105\nremedy at law, “unclean hands” (namely, that plaintiffs cannot obtain equitable relief because they participated in, and benefited from, the sale of cigarettes), and statute of limitations.\nAs of February 5, 2021, there were\n17\nhealth care cost recovery cases pending against us, our subsidiaries or indemnitees in Brazil (\n1\n), Canada (\n10\n), Korea (\n1\n) and Nigeria (\n5\n), compared with\n17\nsuch cases on February 3, 2020 and\n16\nsuch cases on February 4, 2019.\nThe health care cost recovery actions pending in Canada are described above under the caption “\nHealth Care Cost Recovery Litigation — Canada.\n”\nIn the health care cost recovery case in Brazil,\nThe Attorney General of Brazil v.

We have not yet been re-served.\nIn the fifth health care cost recovery case in Nigeria,\nThe Attorney General of Ogun State v. British American Tobacco (Nigeria) Limited, et al., High Court of Ogun State, Abeokuta, Nigeria\n, filed February 26, 2008, we and other members of the industry are defendants.

Plaintiff alleges that defendants concealed the health hazards of smoking, marketed to youth, added ingredients to make their products more harmful and addictive, and misled consumers into believing that\nLights\ncigarettes are safer than regular cigarettes.  The National Health Insurance Service seeks to recover damages allegedly incurred in treating\n3,484\npatients with small cell lung cancer, squamous cell lung cancer, and squamous cell laryngeal cancer from 2003 to 2012.  The trial court dismissed the case in its entirety on November 20, 2020. Plaintiff appealed.\nLabel-Related Cases:\nThese cases, now brought only by individual plaintiffs, allege that the use of the descriptor “Lights” or other alleged misrepresentations or omissions of labeling information constitute fraudulent and misleading conduct.

Plaintiffs' allegations of liability in these cases are based on various theories of recovery including product defect, concealment, and misrepresentation. Plaintiffs in these cases seek various forms of relief including injunctive relief such as banning cigarettes, descriptors, smoking in certain places and advertising, as well as implementing communication campaigns and reimbursement of medical expenses incurred by public or private institutions.\nAs of February 5, 2021, there were\n2\npublic civil actions pending against our subsidiaries in Argentina (\n1\n) and Venezuela (\n1\n), compared with\n2\nsuch cases on February 3, 2020, and\n2\nsuch cases on February 4, 2019.\nIn the public civil action in Argentina,\nAsociación Argentina de Derecho de Danos v. Massalin Particulares S.A., et al., Civil Court of Buenos Aires, Argentina,\nfiled February 26, 2007, our subsidiary and another member of the industry are defendants. The plaintiff, a consumer association, seeks the establishment of a relief fund for reimbursement of medical costs associated with diseases allegedly caused by smoking. Our subsidiary filed its answer in September 2007. In March 2010, the case file was transferred to the Federal Court on Administrative Matters after the Civil Court granted plaintiff's request to add the national government as a co-plaintiff in the case. The case is currently awaiting a court decision on the merits.\nIn the public civil action in Venezuela,\nFederation of Consumers and Users Associations (“FEVACU”), et al. v. National Assembly of Venezuela and the Venezuelan Ministry of Health, Constitutional Chamber of the Venezuelan Supreme Court\n, filed April 29, 2008, we were not named as a defendant, but the plaintiffs published a notice pursuant to court order, notifying all interested parties to appear in the case. In January 2009, our subsidiary appeared in the case in response to this notice. The plaintiffs purport to represent the right to health of the citizens of Venezuela and claim that the government failed to protect adequately its citizens' right to health. The claim asks the court to order the government to enact stricter regulations on the manufacture and sale of tobacco products. In addition, the plaintiffs ask the court to order companies involved in the tobacco industry to allocate a percentage of their “sales or benefits” to establish a fund to pay for the health care costs of treating smoking-related diseases. In October 2008, the court ruled that plaintiffs have standing to file the claim and that the claim meets the threshold admissibility requirements. In December 2012, the court admitted our subsidiary and BAT's subsidiary as interested third parties. In February 2013, our subsidiary answered the complaint.\nReduced-Risk Products\nIn Colombia, an individual filed a purported class action,\nAna Ferrero Rebolledo v. Philip Morris Colombia S.A., et al.\n, in April 2019 against our subsidiaries with the Civil Court of Bogota related to the marketing of our Platform 1 product. Plaintiff alleged  that our subsidiaries advertise the product in contravention of law and in a manner that misleads consumers by portraying the product in a positive light, and further asserts that the Platform 1 vapor contains many toxic compounds, creates a high level of dependence, and has damaging second-hand effects.   Plaintiff sought injunctive relief and damages on her behalf and on a behalf of two classes (class 1 - all Platform 1 consumers in Colombia who seek damages for the purchase price of the product and personal injuries related to the alleged addiction, and class 2 - all residents of the neighborhood where the advertising allegedly took place who seek damages for exposure to the alleged illegal advertising).  Our subsidiaries answered the complaint in January 2020, and in February 2020, plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint modifies the relief sought on behalf of the named plaintiff and on behalf of a single class (all consumers of Platform 1 products in Colombia who seek damages for the product purchase price and personal injuries related to the use of an allegedly harmful product).\nOther Litigation\nThe Department of Special Investigations of the government of Thailand (\"DSI\") conducted an investigation into alleged underpayment by our subsidiary, Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\"), of customs duties and excise taxes relating to imports from the Philippines covering the period 2003-2007.  On January 18, 2016, the Public Prosecutor filed charges against our subsidiary and seven former and current employees\nin the\nBangkok Criminal Court alleging that PM Thailand and the individual defendants jointly and with the intention to defraud the Thai government, under-declared import prices of cigarettes to avoid full payment of taxes and duties in connection with import entries of cigarettes from the Philippines during the period of July 2003 to June 2006. The government is seeking a fine of approximately THB\n80.8\nbillion (approximately $\n2.7\nbillion).  In May 2017, Thailand enacted a new customs act. The new act, which took effect in November 2017, substantially limits the amount of fines that Thailand could seek in these proceedings.  PM Thailand believes that its declared import prices are in compliance with the Customs Valuation Agreement of the World Trade Organization and Thai law and that the allegations of the Public Prosecutor are inconsistent with several decisions already taken by Thai Customs and other Thai governmental agencies.  Trial in the case began in November 2017 and concluded in September 2019.  In November 2019, the trial court found our subsidiary guilty of under-declaration of the prices\n107\nand imposed a fine of approximately THB\n1.2\nbillion (approximately $\n39.9\nmillion).  The trial court dismissed all charges against the individual defendants. In December 2019, as required by the Thai law, our subsidiary paid the fine.  This payment is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and negatively impacted net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the period of payment.  Our subsidiary filed an appeal of the trial court's decision. In addition, the Public Prosecutor filed an appeal of the trial court's decision challenging the dismissal of charges against the individual defendants and the amount of the fine imposed. If our subsidiary ultimately prevails on appeal, then Thailand will be required to return this payment to our subsidiary.\nThe DSI also conducted an investigation into alleged underpayment by PM Thailand of customs duties and excise taxes relating to imports from Indonesia covering the period 2000-2003. On January 26, 2017, the Public Prosecutor filed charges against PM Thailand and its former Thai employee in the Bangkok Criminal Court alleging that PM Thailand and its former employee jointly and with the intention to defraud the Thai government under-declared import prices of cigarettes to avoid full payment of taxes and duties in connection with import entries during the period from January 2002 to July 2003. The government is seeking a fine of approximately THB\n19.8\nbillion (approximately $\n658\nmillion). In May 2017, Thailand enacted  a new customs act. The new act, which took effect in November 2017, substantially limits the amount of fines that Thailand could seek in these proceedings.  PM Thailand believes that its declared import prices are in compliance with the Customs Valuation Agreement of the World Trade Organization and Thai law, and that the allegations of the Public Prosecutor are inconsistent with several decisions already taken by Thai Customs and a Thai court. Trial in the case began in November 2018 and concluded in December 2019.  In March 2020, the trial court found our subsidiary guilty of under-declaration of the prices and imposed a fine of approximately THB\n130\nmillion (approximately $\n4.3\nmillion).  The trial court dismissed all charges against the individual defendant. In April 2020, as required by Thai law, our subsidiary paid the fine. Our subsidiary will appeal the trial court's decision. In addition, the Public Prosecutor filed an appeal of the trial court's decision challenging the dismissal of charges against the individual defendant and the amount of the fine imposed. If our subsidiary ultimately prevails on appeal, then Thailand will be required to return this payment to our subsidiary.\nThe South Korean Board of Audit and Inspection (“BAI”) conducted an audit of certain Korean government agencies and the tobacco industry into whether inventory movements ahead of the January 1, 2015 increase of cigarette-related taxes by tobacco companies, including Philip Morris Korea Inc. (\"PM Korea\"), our South Korean subsidiary, were in compliance with South Korean tax laws.  In November 2016, the tax authorities completed their audit and assessed allegedly underpaid taxes and penalties.  In order to avoid nonpayment financial costs, PM Korea paid approximately KRW\n272\nbillion (approximately $\n243\nmillion), of which KRW\n100\nbillion (approximately $\n89.3\nmillion) was paid in 2016 and KRW\n172\nbillion (approximately $\n153.7\nmillion) was paid in the first quarter of 2017.  These paid amounts are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and negatively impacted  net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the period of payment.  PM Korea appealed the assessments.  In January 2020, a trial court ruled that PM Korea did not underpay taxes in the amount of approximately KRW\n218\nbillion (approximately $\n195\nmillion).  The tax authorities appealed this decision to the appellate court. In September 2020, the appellate court upheld the trial court's decision. The tax authorities have appealed to the Supreme Court of South Korea. In June 2020, another trial court ruled that PM Korea did not underpay approximately KRW\n54\nbillion (approximately $\n48\nmillion) of alleged underpayments. The government agencies appealed this decision. In January 2021, the appellate court upheld the trial court's decision. The government agencies may appeal. If the tax authorities and government agencies ultimately lose, then they would be required to return the paid amounts to PM Korea.\nThe Moscow Tax Inspectorate for Major Taxpayers (“MTI”) conducted an audit of AO Philip Morris Izhora (“PM Izhora”), our Russian subsidiary, for the 2015-2017 financial years. On July 26, 2019, MTI issued its initial assessment, claiming that intercompany sales of cigarettes between PM Izhora and another Russian subsidiary prior to excise tax increases and submission by PM Izhora of the maximum retail sales price notifications for cigarettes to the tax authorities were improper under Russian tax laws and resulted in underpayment of excise taxes and VAT. In August 2019, PM Izhora submitted its objections disagreeing with MTI’s allegations set forth in the initial assessment and MTI’s methodology for calculating the alleged underpayments. MTI accepted some of PM Izhora’s arguments and in September 2019, issued the final tax assessment claiming an underpayment of RUB\n24.3\nbillion (approximately $\n374\nmillion), including penalties and interest. In accordance with Russian tax laws, PM Izhora paid the entire amount of MTI’s final assessment.   This amount was neither imposed on, nor concurrent with, the specific revenue-producing transaction, nor was it collected from customers of our Russian subsidiaries.    In the third quarter of 2019, PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $\n374\nmillion, in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings, representing $\n315\nmillion net of an associated income tax benefit of $\n59\nmillion.\nThe Saudi Arabia Customs General Authority issued its assessments requiring our distributors (one former and one current) to pay additional customs duties in an amount of approximately\n1.5\nbillion Saudi Riyal, or approximately $\n396\nmillion, in relation to the fees paid by these distributors under their agreements with our subsidiary for exclusive rights to distribute our products in Saudi Arabia during the period of 2014 through 2018.  In order to challenge these assessments, the distributors posted bank guarantees equaling the amount of the above assessments. To enable the distributors' challenge, our subsidiary agreed with the banks to bear\n80\npercent of the amount the authority may draw on the bank guarantees. In September and October 2020, respectively, the distributors lost their\n108\nchallenges of the assessments; both distributors appealed. Our subsidiary and our distributors believe that customs duties paid in Saudi Arabia were in compliance with the applicable law and the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement.\nA putative shareholder class action lawsuit,\nIn re Philip Morris International Inc. Securities Litigation\n, is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, purportedly on behalf of purchasers of Philip Morris International Inc. stock between July 26, 2016 and April 18, 2018.  The lawsuit names Philip Morris International Inc. and certain officers and employees as defendants and includes allegations that the defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose information about PMI’s business, operations, financial condition, and prospects, related to product sales of, and alleged irregularities in clinical studies of, PMI’s Platform 1 product.   The lawsuit seeks various forms of relief, including damages.   In November 2018, the court consolidated three putative shareholder class action lawsuits with similar allegations previously filed in the Southern District of New York (namely,\nCity of Westland Police and Fire Retirement System v. Philip Morris International Inc., et al., Greater Pennsylvania Carpenters’ Pension Fund v. Philip Morris International Inc., et al., and Gilchrist v. Philip Morris International Inc., et al.\n) into these proceedings. A putative shareholder class action lawsuit,\nRubenstahl v. Philip Morris International Inc., et al.\n, that had been previously filed in December 2017 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff due to similar allegations in these proceedings. On February 4, 2020, the court granted defendants’ motion in its entirety, dismissing all but one of the plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice.  The court noted that one of plaintiffs’ claims (allegations relating to four non-clinical studies of PMI’s Platform 1 product) did not state a viable claim but allowed plaintiffs to replead that claim by March 3, 2020.  On February 18, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's February 4th decision; this motion was denied on September 21, 2020. On September 28, 2020, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking to replead allegations relating to four non-clinical studies of PMI's Platform 1 product. We believe that this lawsuit is without merit and will continue to defend it vigorously.\nIn April 2020, affiliates of British American Tobacco plc (“BAT”) commenced patent infringement proceedings,\nRAI Strategic Holdings, Inc., et al. v. Altria Client Services LLC, et al.\n,  in the federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia, where PMI's subsidiary, Philip Morris Products S.A., as well as Altria Group, Inc.'s subsidiaries, are defendants. Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief against the commercialization of the Platform 1 products in the United States.  In April 2020, BAT affiliates filed a complaint against PMI, Philip Morris Products S.A., Altria Group, Inc., and its subsidiaries before the International Trade Commission (“ITC”). Plaintiffs seek an order to prevent the importation of Platform 1 products into the United States. The ITC evidentiary hearing closed on February 1, 2021. The administrative law judge has scheduled an initial determination date of May 14, 2021 and the target date for the final determination of the ITC is September 15, 2021. In June 2020, defendants filed their responses in both proceedings. In the Eastern District of Virginia case, the defendants also counterclaimed that BAT infringed their patents relating to certain e-vapor products, seeking damages for the commercialization of these products by BAT.\nIn April 2020, BAT’s affiliate commenced patent infringement proceedings,\nNicoventures Trading Limited v. PM GmbH, et al.,\nagainst PMI’s German subsidiary, Philip Morris GmbH, and Philip Morris Products S.A., in the Regional Court in Munich, Germany.

Plaintiffs seek damages, as well as injunctive relief against the manufacture in Italy of the Platform 1 heated tobacco units allegedly infringing the asserted patents and the commercialization of the Platform 1 products in Italy. As part of this proceeding, in October 2020, BAT’s affiliates filed a request based on one of the two asserted patents seeking preliminary injunctive relief against the manufacture and commercialization of the Platform 1 products in Italy.\nIn October 2020, BAT’s affiliate commenced patent infringement proceedings,\nNicoventures Trading Limited v.

In October  2020, the court dismissed plaintiff’s request for preliminary injunction in its entirety. In October 2020, plaintiff appealed.  In February 2021, the appellate court denied plaintiffs’ appeal, confirming the dismissal of plaintiffs’ request.\nIn October 2020, BAT’s affiliate commenced patent infringement proceedings,\nRAI Strategic Holdings, Inc. v.

Philip Morris Japan, Limited\n,\net al\n., against PMI’s Japanese subsidiary, Philip Morris Japan Limited, and a third-party distributor in the Tokyo District Court. Plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief against the commercialization of the Platform 1 products in Japan.\nIn November 2020, BAT’s affiliate commenced patent infringement proceedings,\nRAI Strategic Holdings, Inc., et al. v. Philip Morris Bulgaria EOOD\n, against PMI’s Bulgarian subsidiary, Philip Morris Bulgaria EOOD, in the Sofia City Court, Bulgaria, seeking preliminary injunctive relief against the commercialization of the Platform 1 products in Bulgaria. In November 2020, the court dismissed plaintiffs’ request for preliminary injunction in its entirety. Plaintiffs have appealed. In January 2021, the appellate court denied plaintiffs’ appeal, confirming the dismissal of plaintiffs’ request.\nIn November 2020, BAT’s affiliates commenced patent infringement proceedings,\nRAI Strategic Holdings, Inc., et al. v. Philip Morris Romania SRL\n, et al., against PMI’s Romanian subsidiaries, Philip Morris Romania S.R.L. and Philip Morris Trading S.R.L., and a third-party distributor in the Court of Law of Bucharest, Civil Registry. Plaintiffs seek damages and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against the manufacture and commercialization of the Platform 1 products in Romania.\nIn December 2020, BAT’s affiliate commenced proceedings,\nNicoventures Trading Limited v. Philip Morris Products S.A., et al.\n, against PMI’s German subsidiaries, Philip Morris GmbH and f6 Cigarettenfabrik GmbH & Co.KG, and Philip Morris Products S.A., in the Hamburg Regional Court, for the alleged infringement of a patent utility model, seeking preliminary injunctive relief against the manufacture and commercialization of the Platform 1 products in Germany.\nOther patent challenges by both parties are pending in various jurisdictions.\nWe believe that the foregoing proceedings by the affiliates of BAT are without merit and will defend them vigorously.\nWe are also involved in additional litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business.  While the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain, management does not expect that the ultimate outcomes of other litigation, including any reasonably possible losses in excess of current accruals, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nThird-Party Guarantees\nOn October 17, 2020, Medicago Inc., an equity method investee of Philip Morris Investments B.V. (“PMIBV”), a PMI subsidiary, entered into a contribution agreement with the Canadian government (the “Contribution Agreement”) whereby the Canadian government agreed to contribute up to CAD\n173\nmillion (approximately $\n131\nmillion on the date of signing) to Medicago Inc., to support its on-going COVID-19 vaccine development and clinical trials, and for the construction of its Quebec City manufacturing facility (the “Project”). PMIBV and the majority shareholder of Medicago Inc. are also parties to the Contribution Agreement as guarantors of Medicago Inc.’s obligations thereunder on a joint and several basis (“Co-Guarantors”). The Co-Guarantors agreed to repay amounts contributed by the Canadian government plus interest, if Medicago Inc. fails to do so, and could be responsible for the costs of other Medicago’s obligations (such as the achievement of specific milestones of the Project).  The maximum amount of these obligations is currently non-estimable.  As of December 31, 2020, PMI has determined that these guarantees did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn connection with the Contribution Agreement, PMIBV and the majority shareholder of Medicago Inc. entered into a guarantors’ agreement that apportions Co-Guarantors’ obligations and limits those of PMIBV to its then share of holdings in Medicago Inc., which as of December 31, 2020 was approximately\n32\n%.  The guarantees are in effect through March 31, 2026.\nSale of Accounts Receivable:\nTo mitigate risk and enhance cash and liquidity management PMI sells trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions. These arrangements allow PMI to sell, on an ongoing basis, certain trade receivables without recourse.  The trade receivables sold are generally short-term in nature and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets. PMI sells trade receivables under two types of arrangements, servicing and non-servicing.  For servicing arrangements, PMI continues to service the sold trade receivables on an administrative basis and does not act on behalf of the unaffiliated financial institutions.  When applicable, a servicing liability is recorded for the estimated fair value of the servicing.  The amounts associated with the servicing liability were not material for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.  Under the non-servicing arrangements, PMI does not provide any administrative support or servicing after the trade receivables have been sold to the unaffiliated financial institutions.\n110\nCumulative trade receivables sold, including excise taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, were $\n11.5\nbillion and $\n10.7\nbillion, respectively.  PMI’s operating cash flows were positively impacted by the amount of the trade receivables sold and derecognized from the consolidated balance sheets, which remained outstanding with the unaffiliated financial institutions.  The trade receivables sold that remained outstanding under these arrangements as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were $\n1.2\nbillion, $\n0.9\nbillion and $\n1.0\nbillion, respectively.  The net proceeds received are included in cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.  The difference between the carrying amount of the trade receivables sold and the sum of the cash received is recorded as a loss on sale of trade receivables within marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings.  For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 the loss on sale of trade receivables was immaterial.\nAsset Impairment and Exit Costs:\nOrganizational Design Optimization\nAs part of PMI’s transformation to a smoke-free future, PMI seeks to optimize its organizational design, which includes the elimination, relocation and outsourcing of certain operations center and centralized activities.  In January 2020, PMI commenced a multi-phase restructuring project in Switzerland.  PMI initiated the employee consultation procedures, as required under Swiss law, for the impacted employees.  In 2020, the consultation procedures for two phases were completed.  The third phase commenced in January 2021 and is expected to impact approximately\n230\npositions.  Until the consultation process for the third phase is concluded, such phase is not considered probable (under U.S. GAAP), and the total potential costs cannot be determined.  As a result,\nno\nrelated costs were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the third phase of the restructuring project.  Additionally, PMI launched a voluntary separation program in Switzerland for certain eligible employees and announced the outsourcing of certain activities in the United States and Poland.\nThese activities are expected to impact approximately\n600\npositions in total, excluding the third phase of the project in Switzerland, that will be either eliminated, relocated or outsourced.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, PMI recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $\n149\nmillion related to the organizational design optimization.\nThe amounts related to the potential pension settlement accounting impact of the restructuring, which could be significant, have not been reflected in 2020 as the thresholds for accounting were not exceeded by December 31, 2020.\nGlobal Manufacturing Infrastructure Optimization\nIn light of declining PMI cigarette volumes resulting from lower total industry volumes and the shift to smoke-free alternatives, PMI continues to optimize its global manufacturing infrastructure.  During 2019, PMI recorded asset impairment and exit costs related to plant closures in Argentina, Colombia, Germany and Pakistan as part of its global manufacturing infrastructure optimization.\nGermany\nOn November 4, 2019, PMI announced that, as part of its global manufacturing infrastructure optimization, its German affiliate, Philip Morris Manufacturing GmbH (\"PMMG\"), reached an agreement with employee representatives to end cigarette production in its factory in Berlin, Germany, by January 1, 2020.  As a result of this agreement, during 2019, PMI recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $\n342\nmillion in the European Union segment.  This amount included pension and employee separation costs of $\n251\nmillion, which will be paid in cash, and asset impairment costs of $\n91\nmillion, primarily related to machinery and equipment, which are non-cash charges.\nOther\nDuring 2019, PMI also recorded pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs of $\n80\nmillion as part of its global manufacturing infrastructure optimization.  These costs were related to cigarette plant closures in Argentina ($\n15\nmillion), Colombia ($\n45\nmillion) and Pakistan ($\n20\nmillion).  The charges were reflected in the Latin America & Canada segment (Argentina and Colombia) and the South & Southeast Asia segment (Pakistan).\n111\nAsset Impairment and Exit Costs by Segment\nDuring 2020 and 2019, PMI recorded the following pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs by segment:\n(1)\nOrganizational design optimization pre-tax charges in 2020 were allocated across all operating segments.\nThe total pre-tax asset impairment and exit costs above were included in marketing, administration and research costs on the consolidated statements of earnings.  During 2018, PMI did not incur asset impairment and exit costs.\nMovement in Exit Cost Liabilities\nThe movement in exit cost liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was as follows:\nFuture cash payments for exit costs incurred to date are anticipated to be substantially paid by the end of 2022, with approximately $\n150\nmillion expected to be paid in 2021.\nDeconsolidation of RBH:\nAs discussed in Note 17.\nContingencies,\nfollowing the March 1, 2019, judgment of the Court of Appeal of Québec in\ntwo\nclass action lawsuits against PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (\"RBH\"), PMI recorded in its consolidated results a pre-tax charge of $\n194\nmillion, representing $\n142\nmillion net of tax, in the first quarter of 2019.  This pre-tax Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense was included in marketing, administration and research costs on PMI's consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019.  The charge reflects PMI’s assessment of the portion of the judgment that represents probable and estimable loss prior to the deconsolidation of RBH and corresponds to the trust account deposit required by the judgment.  RBH’s share of the deposit is approximately CAD\n257\nmillion.\n112\nOn March 22, 2019, RBH obtained an initial order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting it protection under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (\"CCAA\"), which is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course with minimal disruption to its customers, suppliers and employees.\nThe administration of the CCAA process, principally relating to the powers provided to the court and the court appointed monitor,  removes certain elements of control of the business from both PMI and RBH.  As a result, PMI has determined that it no longer has a controlling financial interest over RBH as defined in ASC 810 (Consolidation), and PMI deconsolidated RBH as of the date of the CCAA filing.  PMI has also determined that it does not exert \"significant influence\" over RBH as that term is defined in ASC 323 (Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures).  Therefore, as of March 22, 2019, PMI accounted for its continuing investment in RBH in accordance with ASC 321 (Investments-Equity Securities) as an equity security, without readily determinable fair value.\nFollowing the deconsolidation, the carrying value of assets and liabilities of RBH was removed from the consolidated balance sheet of PMI, and the continuing investment in RBH was recorded at fair value at the date of deconsolidation.  The total amount deconsolidated from PMI’s balance sheet was $\n3,519\nmillion, including $\n1,323\nmillion of cash, $\n1,463\nmillion of goodwill, $\n529\nmillion of accumulated other comprehensive earnings, primarily related to historical currency translation and $\n204\nmillion of other assets and liabilities, net.  While PMI is accounting for its investment in RBH as an equity security, PMI would recognize dividends as income upon receipt.  However, while it remains under creditor protection, RBH does not anticipate paying dividends.\nThe fair value of PMI’s continuing investment in RBH of $\n3,280\nmillion was determined at the date of deconsolidation, recorded within equity investments and is assessed for impairment on an ongoing basis.  The estimated fair value of the underlying business was determined based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis, as well as a market approach for certain contingent liabilities.  The information used in the estimate includes observable inputs, primarily a discount rate of\n8\n%, a terminal growth rate of\n2.5\n% and information about total tobacco market size in Canada and RBH’s share of the market, as well as unobservable inputs such as operating budgets and strategic plans, various inflation scenarios, estimated shipment volumes, and expected product pricing and projected margins.\nThe difference between the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of RBH that were deconsolidated and the fair value of the continuing investment, as determined at the date of deconsolidation, was $\n239\nmillion, before tax, and this loss on deconsolidation is reflected within marketing, administration and research costs on PMI’s consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019.  PMI also recorded a tax benefit of $\n49\nmillion within the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019, related to the reversal of a deferred tax liability on unremitted earnings of RBH.\nRBH is party to transactions with PMI and its consolidated subsidiaries entered into in the normal course of business; these transactions include royalty payments and recharge of various corporate expenses for services benefiting RBH.  Up to the date of the CCAA filing, these transactions were eliminated on consolidation and had no impact on PMI’s consolidated statement of earnings.  After deconsolidating RBH, these transactions are treated as third-party transactions in PMI’s financial statements.  The amount of these related-party transactions is included within Note 4.\nRelated Parties - Equity investments and Other.\nDevelopments in the CCAA process, including resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all pending tobacco-related litigation currently stayed in Canada, as discussed in Note 17.\nContingencies\n, could result in a material change in the fair value of PMI’s continuing investment in RBH.\nLeases:\nPMI’s operating leases are principally for real estate (office space, warehouses and retail store space) and vehicles.  Lease terms range from\n1\nyear to\n73\nyears, some of which include options to renew, which are reasonably certain to be renewed. Lease terms may also include options to terminate the lease.  The exercise of a lease renewal or termination option is at PMI’s discretion.\n113\nPMI’s operating leases at December 31, 2020 and 2019, were as follows:\nFor information regarding PMI’s immaterial finance leases, see Note 7.\nIndebtedness\n.\nThe components of PMI’s lease cost were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nMaturity of PMI’s operating lease liabilities, on an undiscounted basis, as of December 31, 2020, was as follows:\nOther information related to PMI’s operating leases was as follows for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n(1)\nPMI’s weighted-average discount rate is based on its estimated pre-tax cost of debt adjusted for country-specific risk.\n114\nQuarterly Financial Data (Unaudited):\nBasic and diluted EPS are computed independently for each of the periods presented. Accordingly, the sum of the quarterly EPS amounts may not agree to the total for the year.\n115\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nPhilip Morris International Inc.:\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, stockholders’ (deficit) equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013)\nissued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n116\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nTobacco-Related Litigation for Smoking and Health Class Actions and Health Care Cost Recovery Actions\nAs desc\nribed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has 9 smoking and health class actions and 17 health care cost recovery actions pending.  The Company records provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when management determines that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  Except as stated otherwise in Note 17, w\nhile it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, after assessing the information available, (i) management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of the pending smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery cases; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss for any of the pending smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery cases; and (iii) accordingly, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes in these cases, if any.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to tobacco-related litigation for smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery actions is a critical audit matter are that there was significant judgment by management when determining the probability of a loss being incurred and an estimate of the amount or range of the potential loss for each case, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor subjectivity, judgment and effort in evaluating management’s assessment related to the loss contingencies associated with smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery actions related claims.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery actions, including controls over determining the probability and range of loss as well as controls over financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with external and internal legal counsel, evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable, and evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery actions contingencies disclosures.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2008.\n117\nReport of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of Philip Morris International Inc. (“PMI”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. PMI’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those written policies and procedures that:\n•\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of PMI;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of PMI are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of PMI; and\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of PMI’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework\n(2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of PMI’s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nBased on this assessment, management determined that, as of December 31, 2020, PMI maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers SA, an independent registered public accounting firm, who audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of PMI included in this report, has audited the effectiveness of PMI’s internal control over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2020, as stated in their report herein.\nFebruary 9, 2021\n118"
