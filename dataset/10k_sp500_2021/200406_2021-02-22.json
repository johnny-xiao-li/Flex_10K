    "text": "General\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,500 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson & Johnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world. The Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated in the State of New Jersey in 1887.\nThe Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic operations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities of the Company's three business segments: Consumer Health (previously referred to as Consumer), Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the country where located.\nSegments of Business\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. Additional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating results under: “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Report; and Note 17 “Segments of Business and Geographic Areas” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nConsumer Health\nThe Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products focused on personal healthcare used in the skin health/beauty, over-the-counter medicines, baby care, oral care, women’s health and wound care markets.

Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle development programs.\nMedical Devices\nThe Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Interventional Solutions, Orthopaedics, Surgery, and Vision fields. Medical Devices in Interventional Solutions include Electrophysiology products (Biosense Webster) to treat cardiovascular diseases, Neurovascular care (Cerenovus) that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke; the Orthopaedics portfolio (DePuy Synthes) is comprised of products in support of Hips, Knees, Trauma, and Spine, Sports & Other; the Surgery portfolios (Ethicon) include advanced and general surgery offerings, solutions that focus on Breast Aesthetics (Mentor) and Ear, Nose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures; and Johnson & Johnson Vision products such as ACUVUE\n®\nBrand disposable contact lenses and ophthalmic products related to cataract and laser refractive surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\nGeographic Areas\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,500 employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human health and well-being.\nThe products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– Segments of Business – Consumer Health,” “– Pharmaceutical” and “– Medical Devices.” However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\nRaw Materials\nRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources.  Where there are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the Company.\nPatents\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes where possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries relating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries face patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—\nIntellectual Property” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nSales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA\n®\n(ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 9.3% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2020. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company.\nJanssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, owns patents specifically related to STELARA\n®.\nThe latest expiring United States patent expires in 2023. The latest expiring European patent expires in 2024.\nSales of the Company’s second largest product, DARZALEX\n®\n(daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO™ (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 5.1% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2020.\nAccordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company.  Genmab A/S owns patents related to DARZALEX\n®\n, and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patents. The latest expiring licensed United States patent expires in 2029. The latest expiring licensed European patent expires in 2031.  Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO™.\nSales of the Company’s third largest product, IMBRUVICA\n®\n(ibrutinib), accounted for approximately 5.0% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2020. Accordingly, patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Pharmacyclics LLC (an AbbVie company) owns the patents related to IMBRUVICA\n®\n, and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patents.  The Pharmacyclics patents and their expiration dates are listed in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book).  Pharmacyclics LLC and Janssen Biotech, Inc. have entered into confidential settlement agreements with certain generic companies granting licenses to market their generic ibrutinib products in the United States before the expiration of certain patents.\nTrademarks\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining protection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S. and other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be of material importance in the operation of its businesses.\nSeasonality\nWorldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for advertising and research and development activity.\nCompetition\nIn all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved. Competition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is important to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.\nEnvironment\nThe Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements did not change during the past year, and is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.\nRegulation\nThe Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which operations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The Company is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the U.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the U.S.  The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe and in other countries are examples of such increased regulation.\nThe regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to actions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some cases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.\nThe U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the US Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different countries in which we conduct business.\nThe costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states, regulatory agencies and congress on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write prescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry.\nThere is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare companies and health care providers. Various transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and, beginning with disclosures in 2022, to certain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing international business practices require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign government official. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of health care generally.\nU.S. government agencies continue efforts to repeal, modify, or invalidate provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) which passed in 2010. For example, federal legislation repealed the ACA’s individual mandate tax penalty as well as the tax on generous employer-sponsored healthcare plans; the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) began permitting states to impose work requirements on persons covered by Medicaid expansion plans; certain federal subsidies to insurers have ended; and certain short-term insurance plans not offering the full array of ACA benefits have been allowed to extend in duration.  Some of these changes are being challenged in U.S. courts and so their long-term impact remains uncertain. The ACA has also been subject to judicial challenge. In November 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in\nTexas v. Azar\n, which challenges the constitutionality of the ACA. Pending resolution of the litigation, all of the ACA but the individual mandate to buy health insurance remains in effect.\nThe U.S. government also continues to propose and implement changes to the Medicare Part D benefit including the size of manufacturer discounts in the coverage gap and catastrophic phases of the benefit.  There are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that would affect drug pricing in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing federal landscape has both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry.\nIn addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the U.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.\nFurther, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex, are subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit, that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's products.  These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.\nThe global regulatory landscape is also subject to change as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the U.S. and global economies. The U.S. FDA and other health authorities have shifted resources and priorities to meet the many challenges presented by the pandemic. Pandemic-related disruptions could negatively impact the processing of regulatory submissions and slow agency review times necessary for the approval or clearance of new drugs and devices. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable and difficult to assess.\nEmployees and Human Capital Management\nAs of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, the number of employees were approximately:\n1\n“Employee” is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term employees, interns and co-op employees. Employee data may not include full population from more recently acquired companies and individuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also excluded.\n2\nFTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total number of individual employees as some work part-time.\nStrategy\nThe Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its long-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce the Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and ethics and compliance.  The Company’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:\n•\nAttracting and recruiting the best talent\n•\nDeveloping and retaining talent\n•\nEmpowering and inspiring talent\nUnderpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed both professionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals.\nCulture and Employee Engagement\nAt Johnson & Johnson, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to patients, consumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees worldwide are further guided by the Company’s Code of Business Conduct which\nsets basic requirements for business conduct and serves as a foundation for the Company policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide additional guidance on expected employee behaviors\nin every market where it operates. The Company c\nonducts global surveys that offer its employees the ability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential human resources risks and identify opportunities to improve. In 2020, 93% of global employees across 78 countries participated in Our Credo Survey which is offered in 36\nlanguages.\nGrowth and Development\nTo continue to lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and retain top talent. The Company believes that its employees must be equipped with the right knowledge and skills and be provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers. Accordingly, professional development programs and educational resources\nare available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each person’s unique career path while creating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company’s long-term strategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for everyone, regardless of where they are on their career journey. In 2020, 44.6% of employees in Manager and above job categories took advantage of career opportunities by moving across functions, country or business segment lines (including upward promotion or lateral transfer and excluding employees in the research and development organizations). The Company's voluntary turnover rate was 5.2%.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)\nThe Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equity and inclusion. Enabling employees to perform at their best while being themselves is fundamental to the Company's continued success. The Company’s DEI vision is:\nBe yourself, change the world\n. The Company's DEI strategy focuses on three pillars that reflect the strategic priorities identified to enable the Company to address the challenges and opportunities presented by this evolving understanding of diversity:\n•\nAccelerate the Company’s efforts to advance a culture of inclusion and innovation\n•\nBuild a diverse workforce for the future\n•\nEnhance business results and reputation\nThe Company's DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and continual employee feedback which remind the Company that while diversity changes by location, inclusion is the same everywhere.\nCompensation and Benefits\nAs part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fairness and equitable treatment in its compensation and benefits for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where possible. The Company's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees' financial, physical, and mental well-being, including annual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement savings programs, health and welfare benefits, paid time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs.\nHealth, Wellness and Safety\nThe Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health for humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right awareness, focus, practices and tools, the Company ensures that all its employees around the world, as well as temporary contractors and visitors to the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and well-being programs throughout the Company and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings best-in-class and to help employees achieve their personal mind and body health goals. The programs and practices the Company advances covers three core dimensions: Healthy Eating, Healthy Movement and Healthy Mind.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s main corporate website address is\nwww.jnj.com.\nAll of the Company’s SEC filings are also available on the Company’s website at\nwww.investor.jnj.com/sec.cfm\n, as soon as reasonably practicable after having been electronically filed or furnished to the SEC.

    "text": "An investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and many are outside of the Company's control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other information in this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set forth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the following is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected, potentially in a material way.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations\nThe Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company’s earnings.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The Company’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological innovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and availability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights to acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product candidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms for the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure patent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could negatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market despite significant prior investment in the related product development.\nFor the Company’s pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a substantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and enter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the Company’s medical device businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or obsolete. The Company’s consumer health businesses face intense competition from other branded products and retailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name consumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products.\nInterruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and reputation.\nThe Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality components and materials. The Company's subsidiaries operate 90 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from hundreds of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions can occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor disputes, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third-party manufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business.\nOther risks associated with our reliance on third parties, including the Company’s strategic partnership with Jabil in the Medical Devices segment, to manufacture these products include reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual property, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other reduction in efficiency, the Company may\nexperience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the Company would need to seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which could affect our business adversely.\nCounterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings, reputation and business.\nOur industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions under which they are manufactured\n–\noften in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites\n–\nas well as the lack of regulation of their contents.\nThe industry's failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and reputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product recalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market into other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted certain aspects of the Company’s business and could cause disruptions or future impact to the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with global health crises and pandemics, including the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus and its mutations (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and is expected to continue to adversely impact, certain aspects of the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products. The spread of COVID-19 has caused the Company to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of the Company's employees), and the Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the Company determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners. The Company continues to monitor the situation and while we have robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19, these efforts may not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain.\nWhile the U.S. and other countries have begun or will begin to reopen their economies,\nthe extent to which COVID-19 will impact the Company's future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak\n. Any resurgence in COVID-19 infections could result in the imposition of new mandates\nand prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of the disease. The continued global spread of COVID-19 could adversely impact the Company's operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, including third-party suppliers, sales and marketing and clinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company's business, financial results, and global economic conditions generally.\nWe also face uncertainties related to our efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, including uncertainties related to the risk that our development programs may not be successful, commercially viable or receive approval or Emergency Use Authorization from regulatory authorities; risks associated with clinical trial data, including further analyses of existing preclinical or clinical trial data that may be inconsistent with the data used for selection of the JNJ-78436735 vaccine candidate and dose level for the Phase 3 (ENSEMBLE) trial; the risk that clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by regulatory authorities; disruptions in the relationships between us, our third-party suppliers and external manufacturers; the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive products; the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer exist; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture any such products; the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs associated with our R&D and manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or provide additional research funding for potential drug development related to COVID-19; the risk that we may not be able to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may experience manufacturing delays once a manufacturing site is activated, or have access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for any potential approved vaccine or product candidate, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine candidate within the projected time periods indicated, and other challenges and risks associated with the pace of our vaccine development program; and pricing and access challenges for such products, including in the U.S.\nIn addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \"Risk Factors\" section and those incorporated by reference herein, i\nncluding risks relating to the Company’s effective tax rate as a result of changes in consumption as well as changes in\nlaws relating to supply of the Company’s products\n.\nGiven that developments concerning the COVID-19 pandemic have been constantly evolving, additional impacts and risks may arise, including litigation, that are not presently known to the Company.\nRisk Related to the Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings\nGlobal sales in the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms and increasing pricing pressures.\nSales of the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-party payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among health care providers, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, increased political scrutiny could result in additional pricing pressures. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom and Japan, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection.\nThe Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and reputational damage.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and lawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes, product liability and claims that their product sales, marketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws. The Company's more significant legal proceedings are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities, derivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS\n®\nBaby Powder, and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids.\nWhile the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance; however the Company utilizes a wholly-owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits.\nProduct reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results of operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.\nConcerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(or its counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nThe Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nLike other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and legal action, by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which they operate. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws. Scrutiny of health care industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant current investigations and\nlitigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings-Government Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nChanges in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations around the world could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and results of operations. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nSee Note 8 on income taxes for additional information.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes with many tax authorities.\nIn connection with the 2015 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nThe Company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the Company’s businesses.\nThe Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights, relating to its products and manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the Company’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent protection for new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such protections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated.\nCompetitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary rights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR) proceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can be protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the competitive position and sales of the products in question.\nThe Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products may challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, process with the FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the FDA of biosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the USPTO is also being used by competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation.\nIn the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk” launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation) by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nRisks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization\nSignificant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products, technologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success.\nThe Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated products and services that address the evolving health care needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development of successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing products lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2020 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful.\nThe Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through collaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of these contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical devices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research and development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the ability to discern patients’ and health care providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies and technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection; obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate the Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products.\nRisk Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions\nThe Company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally\n.\nThe Company’s extensive operations and business activity outside the U.S. are accompanied by certain financial, economic and political risks, including those listed below.\nForeign Currency Exchange\n: In fiscal 2020, approximately 48% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S., with approximately 23% in Europe, 7% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 18% in the Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company’s revenues and expenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.\nInflation and Currency Devaluation Risks\n: The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations in economies experiencing high inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.\nIllegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products\n: The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries where government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s sales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of limited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal under current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and other customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly.\nAnti-Bribery and Other Regulations:\nThe Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries outside the U.S., the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and the purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities;\ntherefore, the Company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including the U.K Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from health care programs.\nOther Legal, Social and Political Risks\n. Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include:\n•\nprotective economic policies taken by governments such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing requirements;\n•\ncompliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;\n•\ndiminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;\n•\npotential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets;\n•\npolitical or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and\n•\ngeopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism, epidemics or pandemics.\nFailure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.\nWe currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets.\nOther Risks\nOur business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a diverse workforce.\nOur continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAn information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or reputation.\nTo meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal protection, and ensure the continuity of the Company’s supply chain. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk\n.\nTo date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and\nregulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial, legal, business or reputational losses.\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources may result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations, which may increase operational costs.\nConcern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an increase in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition"

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nIn 2020, worldwide sales increased 0.6% to $82.6 billion as compared to an increase of 0.6% in 2019. These sales changes consisted of the following:\nThe net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a negative impact of 0.3% in 2020 and a negative impact of 1.7% in 2019.\nSales by U.S. companies were $43.1 billion in 2020 and $42.1 billion in 2019. This represents increases of 2.5% in 2020 and 0.5% in 2019. Sales by international companies were $39.5 billion in 2020 and $40.0 billion in 2019. This represents a decrease of 1.3% in 2020 and an increase of 0.7% in 2019.\nThe five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.3%, 3.9% and 2.8%, respectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.0%, 3.9% and 2.1%, respectively.\nIn 2020, sales by companies in Europe achieved growth of 2.8% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 2.0% and a positive currency impact of 0.8%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere (excluding the U.S.) experienced a sales decline of 10.2% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of 0.4% offset by a negative currency impact of 10.6%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region experienced a sales decline of 2.7% as compared to the prior year, including an operational decline of 3.1% partially offset by a positive currency impact of 0.4%.\nThe 2020 results benefited from the inclusion of a 53rd week. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Annual Closing Date details). The Company estimated that the fiscal year 2020 sales growth rate was enhanced by approximately 1.0%. While the additional week added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible.\nIn 2020, the Company utilized three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 16.0%, 12.0% and 12.0% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2019, the Company had three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 15.0%, 12.0% and 11.0% of the total consolidated revenues.\nNote: values may have been rounded\nAnalysis of Sales by Business Segments\nConsumer Health Segment\nConsumer Health segment sales in 2020 were $14.1 billion, an increase of 1.1% from 2019, which included 3.0% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 1.9%.  U.S. Consumer Health segment sales were $6.4 billion, an increase of 9.0%. International sales were $7.7 billion, a decrease of 4.6%, which included an operational decline of 1.3% and a negative currency impact of 3.3%.  In 2020, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 0.1% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Consumer Health segment.\nMajor Consumer Health Franchise Sales*:\nThe OTC franchise sales of $4.8 billion increased 8.5% as compared to the prior year. Growth was primarily attributable to sales from TYLENOL\n®\ndriven by COVID-19 stocking demand, ZYRTEC\n®\ndue to competitor product out of stock and PEPCID\n®\ndue to competitive product withdrawal both in the U.S., and increased consumption in anti-smoking aids. International sales were negatively impacted by COVID-19 and low incidence of cough and flu.\nThe Skin Health/Beauty franchise sales were $4.5 billion in 2020, a decrease of 3.1% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily due to negative COVID-19 related impacts and SKU rationalization partially offset by growth in eCommerce and new product innovation.\nThe Oral Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 7.4% as compared to the prior year primarily attributable to sales of LISTERINE\n®\nmouthwash due to U.S. eCommerce and club channel growth, increased stocking demand related to COVID-19 and new product launches in Asia Pacific.\nThe Baby Care franchise sales were $1.5 billion in 2020, a decrease of 9.4% compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily due to COVID-19 related impacts, SKU rationalization and the Baby Center divestiture in the U.S. partially offset by strength in AVEENO\n®\nbaby.\nThe Women’s Health franchise sales were $0.9 billion in 2020, a decrease of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. The decline was primarily driven by COVID-19 impacts.\nThe Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.7 billion in 2020, an increase of 7.2% as compared to the prior year. Growth was due to strong performance of NEOSPORIN\n®\nand\nBAND-AID\n®\nBrand Adhesive Bandages and COVID-19 related demand in the Asia Pacific region.\nPharmaceutical Segment\nPharmaceutical segment sales in 2020 were $45.6 billion, an increase of 8.0% from 2019, which included operational growth of 8.2% and a negative currency impact of 0.2%.  U.S. sales were $25.7 billion, an increase of 7.8%. International sales were $19.8 billion, an increase of 8.3%, which included 8.8% operational growth and a negative currency impact of 0.5%. In 2020, acquisitions and divestitures had a net negative impact of 0.2% on the operational sales growth of the worldwide Pharmaceutical segment. Adjustments to previous reserve estimates positively impacted the Pharmaceutical segment operational growth by approximately 1.0% in both fiscal years 2020 and 2019.\nMajor Pharmaceutical Therapeutic Area Sales*:\n*Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation\n** Percentage greater than 100% or not meaningful\n(1)\nPreviously included in Other Oncology\n(2)\nInclusive of TRACLEER\n®\nwhich was previously disclosed separately\nImmunology products sales were $15.1 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 7.9% as compared to the prior year driven by strong uptake of STELARA\n®\n(ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis and strength in TREMFYA\n®\n(guselkumab) in Psoriasis. This was partially offset by COVID-19 related demand and lower sales of REMICADE\n®\n(infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition.\nThe patents for REMICADE\n®\n(infliximab)\nin certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar versions of REMICADE\n®\nhave been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE\n®\nin those markets.  Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE\n®\nin markets outside the United States. In the United States, a biosimilar version of REMICADE\n®\nwas introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE\n®\n.\nInfectious disease products sales were $3.6 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 4.7% as compared to the prior year primarily due to strong sales of SYMTUZA\n®\nand\nJULUCA\n®\n.\nThis was partially offset by lower sales of PREZISTA\n®\nand PREZCOBIX\n®\n/REZOLSTA\n®\ndue to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA\n®\nin certain countries outside the U.S.\nNeuroscience products sales were $6.5 billion, representing an increase of 3.5% as compared to the prior year. Paliperidone long-acting injectables growth driven by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA\n®\n/XEPLION\n®\n(paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA\n®\n/TREVICTA\n®\nfrom new patient starts and persistence. The growth was partially offset by migration from RISPERDAL CONSTA\n®\n(risperidone) and declines in CONCERTA\n®\n(methylphenidate) due to competitive entrants.\nOncology products achieved sales of $12.4 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 15.7% as compared to the prior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX\n®\n(daratumumab) driven by patient uptake in all lines of therapy and the launch of a subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and E.U.; IMBRUVICA\n®\n(ibrutinib) due to market growth globally and maintaining strong share and the continued global launch uptake and share gains of ERLEADA\n®\n(apalutamide). Additionally, the growth was negatively impacted by declining sales of ZYTIGA\n®\n(abiraterone acetate) and VELCADE\n®\n(bortezomib) due to generic competition.\nPulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $3.1 billion, representing an increase of 20.0% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of OPSUMIT\n®\n(macitentan) and UPTRAVI\n®\n(selexipag) were due to continued share gains and market growth. Additionally, sales of TRACLEER\n®\n(bosentan) were negatively impacted by generics and migration to OPSUMIT\n®\n.\nCardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $4.9 billion, a decline of 6.0% as compared to the prior year. Sales growth of INVOKANA\n®\n/INVOKAMET\n®\n(canagliflozin) were due to market growth and favorable channel mix dynamics in the U.S. and strength in the European region partially offset by U.S. share declines due to competitive pressures. The growth of XARELTO\n®\n(rivaroxaban) was due to demand growth partially offset by higher rebates. Lower sales of PROCRIT\n®\n/ EPREX\n®\n(epoetin alfa) were due to biosimilar competition.\nDuring 2020, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and additional indications for existing drugs as follows:\nMedical Devices Segment\nThe Medical Devices segment sales in 2020 were $23.0 billion, a decrease of 11.6% from 2019, which included an operational decrease of 11.4% and a negative currency impact of 0.2%. U.S. sales were $11.0 billion, a decrease of 10.9% as compared to the prior year. International sales were $11.9 billion, a decrease of 12.2% as compared to the prior year, with an operational decrease of 11.8% and a negative currency impact of 0.4%. In 2020, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the Medical Devices segment worldwide operational sales growth was a negative 0.9% of which, the divestiture of Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP) had an impact of approximately 0.8%. Growth was negatively impacted by COVID-19 and associated deferral of medical procedures.\nMajor Medical Devices Franchise Sales*:\n*Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation\n(1)\nIncludes\nSpecialty Surgery which was previously disclosed separately\n(2)\nPreviously referred to as Spine & Other\nThe Surgery franchise sales were $8.2 billion in 2020, a decrease of 13.4% from 2019. The decline in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 and competitive pressures in the U.S. This was partially offset by the success of new products outside the U.S. and the recovery of an isolated supply disruption in the prior year related to SURGIFLO\n®\n. The decline in General Surgery was primarily driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 and the ASP divestiture.\nThe Orthopaedics franchise sales were $7.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of 12.2% from 2019. The decline in hips was driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 partially offset by a leadership position in the Anterior approach, strong market demand for the ACTIS\n®\nstem and enabling technologies – KINCISE™ and VELYS™ Hip Navigation. The decline in knees was driven by the negative impact of COVID-19. The decline in Trauma was driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 partially offset by strength from new products. The decline in Spine, Sports & Other was driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 partially offset by the uptake of new products.\nThe Vision franchise sales were of $3.9 billion in 2020, a decrease of 15.2% from 2019. The  Contact Lenses/Other operational decline was due to the negative impact of COVID-19. The Surgical operational decline was primarily driven by the negative impact of COVID-19 and competitive pressures in the U.S.\nThe Interventional Solutions franchise achieved sales of $3.0 billion in 2020, an increase of 1.6% from 2019. Growth in the electrophysiology business was driven by Atrial Fibrillation procedure growth coupled with strength from new products and market recovery offsetting negative impacts from COVID-19.\nAnalysis of Consolidated Earnings Before Provision for Taxes on Income\nConsolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was $16.5 billion and $17.3 billion for the years 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a percent to sales, consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income was 20.0% and 21.1%, in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(Dollars in billions. Percentages in chart are as a percent to total sales)\nCost of Products Sold and Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses:\n(Dollars in billions. Percentages in chart are as a percent to total sales)\nCost of products sold increased as a percent to sales driven by:\n•\nMedical Device idle capacity costs associated with COVID-19 related production slow downs\n•\nEstablishment of obsolescence reserves and fixed cost deleveraging associated with the impact of COVID-19 in the Medical Devices business\n•\nSupply chain costs associated with the development of the COVID-19 vaccine in the Pharmaceutical business\npartially offset by:\n•\nFavorable mix within the Pharmaceutical business\n•\nFavorable product mix with a higher percentage of sales coming from the Pharmaceutical business\nThe intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold was $4.7 billion and $4.5 billion, for the years 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSelling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses decreased as a percent to sales driven by:\n•\nLeveraging in the Pharmaceutical and Consumer Health businesses\n•\nPortfolio and investment optimization including execution of the ongoing SKU rationalization program in the Consumer Health business\n26\n•\nFavorable segment mix with a higher percentage of sales coming from the Pharmaceutical business\npartially offset by:\n•\nThe negative impact on sales resulting from COVID-19 in the Medical Devices business\nResearch and Development Expense:\nResearch and development expense by segment of business was as follows:\nResearch and development activities represent a significant part of the Company's business. These expenditures relate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and developmental milestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to launch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high quality and innovative products.\nResearch and Development increased as a percent to sales primarily driven by:\n•\nSegment mix driven by a higher percentage of sales generated by the Pharmaceutical business versus the prior year\n•\nThe negative COVID-19 impact on Medical Devices sales\n•\nIncreased investment in the Medical Devices business related to robotics and digital programs\n•\nPortfolio progression including the COVID-19 vaccine in the Pharmaceutical business, net of governmental reimbursements\nResearch facilities are located in the U.S., Belgium, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom with additional R&D support in over 30 other countries.\nIn-Process Research and Development (IPR&D):\nIn fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.2 billion primarily related to a partial impairment due to timing and progression of one of the digital surgery platforms acquired with the Auris Health acquisition. In the fiscal year 2019, the Company recorded an IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion for the remaining intangible asset value related to the development program of AL-8176, an investigational drug for the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) acquired with the 2014 acquisition of Alios Biopharma Inc. The impairment charge was based on additional information, including clinical data, which became available and led to the Company's decision to abandon the development of AL-8176.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net:\nOther (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses related to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), unrealized gains and losses on investments, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition-related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income.\nOther (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2020 was unfavorable by $0.4 billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to the following:\n(1)\n2020 litigation expense primarily associated with Talc related reserves and certain settlements ($4.0 billion). 2019 litigation expense primarily related to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation ($4.0 billion).\n(2)\n2020 is primarily driven by a contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition.\n(3)\n2019 included the divestiture of ASP\nInterest (Income) Expense:\nThe fiscal year 2020 included net interest expense of $90 million as compared to income of $39 million in the fiscal year 2019. This was primarily due to reduced interest income resulting from lower rates of interest earned on cash balances and a higher average debt balance. This was partially offset by a lower average debt interest rate and a higher average cash balance. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $25.2 billion at the end of 2020, and averaged $22.2 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $19.3 billion and $19.5 billion average cash balance in 2019. The total debt balance at the end of 2020 was $35.3 billion with an average debt balance of $31.5 billion as compared to $27.7 billion at the end of 2019 and an average debt balance of $29.1 billion. In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued approximately $5.0 billion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8 billion outstanding at year end. In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $7.5 billion.\nIncome Before Tax by Segment\nIncome (loss) before tax by segment of business were as follows:\n(1)\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\n(2)\nAmounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense.\nConsumer Health Segment:\nIn 2020, the Consumer Health segment loss before tax as a percent of sales was (7.6)% versus income before tax of 14.8% in 2019. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:\n•\nHigher litigation expense of $3.9 billion in 2020 vs. $0.4 billion in 2019 (primarily associated with talc related reserves and certain settlements)\n•\nThe fiscal year 2019 included a gain of $0.3 billion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO\npartially offset by:\n•\nPortfolio and investment optimization including execution of the ongoing SKU rationalization program\nPharmaceutical Segment:\nIn 2020, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 33.9% versus 20.9% in 2019. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:\n•\nLower litigation expense of $0.8 billion in 2020 vs. $4.3 billion in 2019 (primarily related to the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation, of which $1.0 billion is in 2020 and $4.0 billion is in 2019)\n•\nAn in-process research and development charge of $0.9 billion in fiscal 2019 related to Alios\n•\nLower acquisition and integration related costs in fiscal 2020\n•\nLeveraging in selling, marketing and administrative expense\nMedical Devices Segment:\nIn 2020, the Medical Devices segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 13.3% versus 28.1% in 2019. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following:\n•\nA gain of $2.0 billion related to the ASP divestiture recorded in the fiscal 2019\n•\nIdle capacity costs associated with COVID-19 related production slow downs in fiscal 2020\n•\nEstablishment of obsolescence reserves and fixed cost deleveraging associated with the impact of COVID-19 in fiscal 2020\n•\nThe negative impact of COVID-19 on sales in fiscal 2020\n•\nAn in-process research and development charge of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily related to the Auris Health acquisition\npartially offset by:\n•\nA contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion in fiscal 2020 related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition\n•\nLitigation expense was $0.3 billion in 2020 vs. $0.4 billion in 2019\nRestructuring:\nIn the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its global supply chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network.  Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2020, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.4 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.2 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.3 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced.\nSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.\nProvision for Taxes on Income:\nThe worldwide effective income tax rate was 10.8% in 2020 and 12.7% in 2019. During the fiscal first quarter of 2021, the Internal Revenue Service published final regulations addressing the requirements for tax deductibility of settlement payments. The Company recorded a pre-tax reserve for $4.0 billion in the fiscal year 2019 based on the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation and recorded an additional pre-tax $1.0 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2020 upon which an effective rate of 21.4% has been applied.\nFor discussion related to the fiscal 2020 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity & Cash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents were $14.0 billion at the end of 2020 as compared to $17.3 billion at the end of 2019.\nThe primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $3.3 billion decrease were:\nIn addition, the Company had $11.2 billion in marketable securities at the end of fiscal year 2020 and $2.0 billion at the end of fiscal year 2019. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nCash flow from operations of $23.5 billion was the result of:\nInvesting activities use of $20.8 billion of cash was primarily used for:\nFinancing activities use of $6.1 billion of cash was primarily used for:\nAs of January 3, 2021, the Company's notes payable and long-term debt was in excess of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of January 3, 2021, the net debt position was $10.1 billion as compared to the prior year of $8.4 billion. There was an increase in the net debt position due to increased borrowings in the fiscal third quarter of 2020. The debt balance at the end of 2020 was $35.3 billion as compared to $27.7 billion in 2019. Considering recent market conditions and the on-going COVID-19 crisis, the Company has evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the talc litigation and agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation of which the majority may be paid over the next two to three years. In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. In the fiscal\nthird quarter of 2020, the Company issued approximately $5.0 billion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8 billion outstanding at year end.  In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $7.5 billion.  For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquisition which closed on October 1, 2020 and for general corporate purposes\n.\nAdditionally, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of January 3, 2021: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.\nFor tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table does not include activity related to business combinations or the Company’s approximate $0.9 billion in contractual supply commitments associated with its development of a COVID-19 vaccine.\nFinancing and Market Risk\nThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows. Accordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign currency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product costs. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2021 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $121 million.  Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2021 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $148 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.\nThe Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and liabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S. and foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1,667 million. In either scenario, at maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.\nThe Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements.\nThe Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $36 million.\nThe Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2020, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which expires on September 9, 2021.  Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Swap Curve or other applicable market\nrate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.\nTotal borrowings at the end of 2020 and 2019 were $35.3 billion and $27.7 billion, respectively. The increase in borrowings was the issuance of notes in 2020 when market conditions were favorable. In 2020, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $10.1 billion compared to net debt of $8.4 billion in 2019. Total debt represented 35.8% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2020 and 31.8% of total capital in 2019. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2020 was $24.04 compared to $22.59 at year-end 2019.\nA summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDividends\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2020 for the 58th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $3.98 per share in 2020 and $3.75 per share in 2019.\nOn January 4, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.01 per share, payable on March 9, 2021 to shareholders of record as of February 23, 2021.\nOther Information\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related disclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding of certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s operating results and financial condition.  These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes, legal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to, the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 3, 2021 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 3, 2021, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nRevenue Recognition:\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2020 and 2019.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating activities.   Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is performed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements are deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures on collaborations.\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not anticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of changes to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.\nBelow are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts and reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019.\nConsumer Health Segment\n(1)\nIncludes reserve for customer rebates of $66 million at January 3, 2021 and $54 million at December 29, 2019, recorded as a contra asset.\nPharmaceutical Segment\n(1)\nIncludes reserve for customer rebates of $174 million at January 3, 2021 and $93 million at December 29, 2019, recorded as a contra asset.\n(2)\nIncludes adjustments\nMedical Devices Segment\n(1)\nIncludes reserve for customer rebates of $707 million at January 3, 2021 and $499 million at December 29, 2019, recorded as a contra asset.\nIncome Taxes:\nIncome taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $0.7 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2021, the Internal Revenue Service published final regulations addressing the requirements for tax deductibility of settlement payments. The Company recorded a pre-tax reserve for $4.0 billion in fiscal 2019 based on the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation and recorded an additional pre-tax $1.0 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2020 upon which an effective rate of 21.4% has been applied.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nLegal and Self Insurance Contingencies:\nThe Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal proceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nSee Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and legal proceedings.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets:\nThe Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets.  As these assumptions and estimates may change over time, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.\nEmployee Benefit Plans:\nThe Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based on assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases, health care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on these rates.\nStock Based Compensation:\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity instruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes option valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the service period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility, risk-free rate and expected dividend yield. Prior to fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market value was calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return.  The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January 3, 2021.\nEconomic and Market Factors\nCOVID-19 considerations and business continuity\nThe Company has considered various internal and external factors in assessing the potential impact of COVID-19 on its business and financial results based upon information available at this time, as follows:\n•\nOperating Model:\nThe Company has a diversified business model across the healthcare industry with flexibility designed into its manufacturing, research and development clinical operations and commercial capabilities.\n•\nSupply Chain:\nThe Company continues to leverage its global manufacturing footprint and dual-source capabilities while closely monitoring and maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers away from high-risk areas to ensure adequate and effective distribution.\n•\nBusiness Continuity:\nThe robust, active business continuity plans across the Company's network have been instrumental in preparing the Company for events like COVID-19 and the ability to meet the majority of patient and consumer needs remains uninterrupted.\n•\nWorkforce:\nThe Company has put procedures in place to protect its essential workforce in manufacturing, distribution, commercial and research operations while ensuring appropriate remote working protocols have been established for other employees.\n•\nLiquidity:\nThe Company's high-quality credit rating allows the Company superior access to the financial capital markets for the foreseeable future. In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued approximately $5.0 billion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8 billion outstanding at year end, for additional liquidity. Additionally, in the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $7.5 billion. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquisition on October 1, 2020 and for general corporate purposes.\n•\nDomestic and Foreign Legislation:\nThe Company will continue to assess and evaluate the on-going global legislative efforts to combat the COVID-19 impact on economies and the sectors in which it participates. Currently, the recent legislative acts put in place are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s operations.\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine production with third party contract manufacturing organizations. These arrangements provide the Company with future supplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such production if capacity is not required. Amounts paid and contractually obligated to be paid to these contract manufacturing organizations of approximately $0.9 billion are reflected in the prepaid expenses and other, other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities accounts in the Company's consolidated balance sheet upon execution of each agreement. Additionally, the Company has entered into certain vaccine development cost sharing arrangements with government related organizations.\nThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers, consumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care.  In response to these concerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2010 - 2020, in the U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for health care products (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.\nIn June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The U.K. officially exited the E.U. on January 31, 2020, however, there was a transition period  to allow time to agree the terms of a new trade deal. On December 30, 2020, the U.K., E.U. and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) signed the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). Over the last few years, Brexit has created global political and economic uncertainty and has led to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations. While the UK and EU have now agreed on a future trade and cooperation agreement, it is still unclear what the ultimate financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. However, the Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or operating results. As of January 3, 2021, the business of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 6% of the Company’s consolidated assets and less than 3% of the Company's fiscal twelve months revenues.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as compared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2020 would have increased or decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $384 million and net income by approximately $115 million.\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted.  This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.\nThe Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place.\nLegal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 3, 2021, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.\nCommon Stock\nThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 16, 2021, there were 132,376 record holders of Common Stock of the Company."

Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.\nColumns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\nDescription of the Company and Business Segments\nThe Company has approximately\n134,500\nemployees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\nThe Company is organized into\nthree\nbusiness segments: Consumer Health (previously referred to as Consumer), Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby care, oral care, skin health/beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These products are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care professionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the orthopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and eye health fields, which are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\nNew Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nASU 2018-18: Collaborative Arrangements\nThe Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2020. This update clarifies the interaction between ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements and ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The update clarifies that certain transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted for under ASC 606 when the counterparty is a customer. In addition, the update precludes an entity from presenting consideration from a transaction in a collaborative arrangement as revenue if the counterparty is not a customer for that transaction. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2016-13: Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\nThe Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2020. This update introduces the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, which requires an entity to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. Under this update, on initial recognition and at each reporting period, an entity is required to recognize an allowance that reflects the entity’s current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2018-14: Compensation - Defined Benefit Plans\nThe Company adopted this standard in the fiscal year ended 2020. This standard revised the financial statement note disclosure requirements of ASC 715-20 for defined benefit plan sponsors. The adoption of this standard had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for defined benefit plan disclosures.\nAccounting Standards adopted in the fiscal 2018 with a cumulative effect to the 2018 opening balance of Retained Earnings\nThe following table summarizes the cumulative effect adjustments made to the 2018 opening balance of retained earnings upon adoption of these accounting standards in 2018:\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nNot Adopted as of January 3, 2021\nThe Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any, from the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. There were no new material accounting standards issued in fiscal 2020 that impacted the Company.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.  The Company invests its cash primarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs).\nRRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less than\n102\n% of their value.  The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or equivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure that collateral received is maintained at\n102\n% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities.\nInvestments\nInvestments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are classified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company reviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as required.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets:\nThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from\n3\nto\n8\nyears.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events or changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between\nthe asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market participants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the Company's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily\nt\nhe Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $\n7.2\nbillion and $\n7.0\nbillion as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in the field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by product and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are almost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately\n1.0\n% of annual net trade sales during each of the fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in the same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive programs. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and value. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative arrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than\n3.0\n% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $\n1.0\nbillion, $\n1.0\nbillion and $\n1.1\nbillion in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than\n0.5\n% of sales to customers for all periods presented.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2020 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired.\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions.  See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and Goodwill.\nFinancial Instruments\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.  Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy includes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy are: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the Company’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial instruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional information on Financial Instruments.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in\nOther assets\n,\nAccrued liabilities\n, and\nOther liabilities\non the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in Property, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\nROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all minimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit rate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following policy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master service agreements, exclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components.\nThe Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing equipment. The ROU asset pertaining to operating leases was $\n1.0\nbillion and $\n1.0\nbillion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The lease liability was $\n1.1\nbillion and $\n1.0\nbillion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The operating lease costs were $\n0.3\nbillion, $\n0.3\nbillion and $\n0.3\nbillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities were $\n0.3\nbillion and $\n0.3\nbillion in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nProduct Liability\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development.  Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product.  Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development.\nAmounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:\nFor all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than\n5\n% of the total annual consolidated research and development expense.\nThe Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including XARELTO\n®\n, co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA\n®\n, developed in collaboration and co-marketed with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.\nSeparately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX\n®\n, licensed from Genmab A/S.\nAdvertising\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses.\nAdvertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet advertising, were $\n2.1\nbillion, $\n2.2\nbillion and $\n2.6\nbillion in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in these estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nIn 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This law included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate from\n35\n% to\n21\n%, effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax on all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of\n15.5\n% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of\n8.0\n%. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will continue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the 2020 was approximately $\n7.7\nbillion, of which $\n6.9\nbillion is classified as noncurrent and reflected as “Long-term taxes payable” on the Company’s balance sheet. The balance of this account is related to receivables from tax authorities not expected to be received in the next 12 months.\nThe TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI).  GILTI is described as the excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by the TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether to record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide for deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the amount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). In 2018, the Company elected to account for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its international subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to January 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company\nintends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $\n0.7\nbillion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nfor further information regarding income taxes.\nNet Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock method.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used when accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes, withholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is recorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is accrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors including, but not limited to: the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 3, 2021 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nAnnual Closing Date\nThe Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of December. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of 53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in fiscal year 2020, and will be the case again in fiscal year 2026.\nReclassification\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\n2.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Current Marketable Securities\nAt the end of the fiscal year 2020 and 2019, cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities were comprised of:\n(1)\nHeld to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings.\n(2)\nAvailable for sale debt securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported net of taxes in other comprehensive income.\nAt the end of fiscal year 2019, the carrying amount was the same as the estimated fair value.\nFair value of government securities and obligations and corporate debt securities were estimated using quoted broker prices and significant other observable inputs.\nThe contractual maturities of the available for sale debt securities at January 3, 2021 are as follows:\nThe Company invests its excess cash in both deposits with major banks throughout the world and other high-quality money market instruments. The Company has a policy of making investments only with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.\n3.\nInventories\nAt the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, inventories were comprised of:\n(1)\nSee Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on assets held for sale and the related divestitures for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. There were no assets held for sale at January 3, 2021.\n4.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nAt the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, property, plant and equipment at cost and accumulated depreciation were:\n(1)\nSee Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on assets held for sale and the related divestitures for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. There were no assets held for sale at January 3, 2021.\nThe Company capitalizes interest expense as part of the cost of construction of facilities and equipment. Interest expense capitalized in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n63\nmillion, $\n70\nmillion and $\n86\nmillion, respectively.\nDepreciation expense, including the amortization of capitalized interest in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n2.6\nbillion, $\n2.5\nbillion and $\n2.6\nbillion, respectively.\nUpon retirement or other disposal of property, plant and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts, respectively. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds are recorded in earnings.\n5.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nAt the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, the gross and net amounts of intangible assets were:\n*The majority is comprised of customer relationships\n(1)\nIn fiscal year 2020, the Company completed multiple acquisitions and recorded in-process research and development intangible assets of $\n6.0\nbillion from Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., $\n0.8\nbillion for bermekimab and certain related assets from XBiotech, Inc., and $\n0.4\nbillion from the acquisition of all outstanding shares in Verb Surgical, Inc.\nGoodwill as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, as allocated by segment of business, was as follows:\nThe weighted average amortization period for patents and trademarks is\n12\nyears. The weighted average amortization period for customer relationships and other intangible assets is\n21\nyears. The amortization expense of amortizable assets included in cost of products sold was $\n4.7\nbillion, $\n4.5\nbillion and $\n4.4\nbillion before tax, for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021, December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively. Intangible asset write-downs are included in Other (income) expense, net.\nThe estimated amortization expense for approved products, before tax, for the five succeeding years is approximately:\nSee Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to acquisitions and divestitures.\n6.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\nAdditionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges.  The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements.  As of January 3, 2021, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA amounted to $\n1.1\nbillion net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings.  The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions.      As of January 3, 2021, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, and cross currency interest rate swaps of $\n37.8\nbillion and $\n30.6\nbillion, respectively. As of December 29, 2019, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps of $\n45.3\nbillion and  $\n20.1\nbillion, respectively.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. The effect of which are immaterial for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019. Gains and losses on net investment hedge are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued.\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\nAs of January 3, 2021, the balance of deferred net gain on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $\n652\nmillion after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the\nnext 12 months\nas a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is\n18\nmonths, excluding interest rate contracts, net investment hedges. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives and hedges for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, net of tax:\nThe following table is the effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instrument for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019:\nThe following table is the effect of net investment hedges for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019:\nThe Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The Company measures equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related to equity investments for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019:\n(1)\nRecorded in Other Income/Expense\n(2)\nOther includes impact of currency\nFor the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 for equity investments without readily determinable market values, $\n76\nmillion and $\n57\nmillion, respectively, of the changes in fair value reflected in net income were the result of impairments. There were $\n21\nmillion and $\n19\nmillion, respectively, of changes in fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices.\nFair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or\nthat the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.\nThe following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs.\nLevel 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.\nThe Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 were as follows:\nSummarized information about changes in liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows:\n(1)\n2019 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $\n1,148\nmillion, which are classified as Level 1 and contingent consideration of $\n1,715\nmillion, classified as Level 3.\n(2)\nIncludes $\n1\nmillion of non-current assets as of December 29, 2019.\n(3)\nIncludes cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps.\n(4)\nClassified as non-current other assets.\n(5)\nClassified as cash equivalents and current marketable securities.\n(6)\nIncludes $\n594\nmillion, $\n1,631\nmillion (primarily related to Auris Health) and $\n397\nmillion, classified as non-current other liabilities as of January 3, 2021, December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively. Includes $\n39\nmillion and $\n84\nmillion classified as current liabilities as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively.\n(7)\nOngoing fair value adjustment amounts are recorded primarily in Research and Development expense.  The Company recorded a contingent consideration reversal of $\n1,148\nmillion in 2020 related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition. The reversal of the contingent consideration was recorded in Other income and expense\nSee Notes 2 and 7 for financial assets and liabilities held at carrying amount on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n7.\nBorrowings\nThe components of long-term debt are as follows:\n(1)\nWeighted average effective rate.\n(2)\nTranslation rate at January 3, 2021.\n(3)\nTranslation rate at December 29, 2019.\n(4)\nThe excess of the fair value over the carrying value of debt was $\n5.4\nbillion at the end of fiscal year 2020 and $\n3.0\nbillion at the end of fiscal year 2019.\n(5)\nIn the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $\n7.5\nbillion.\nFair value of the long-term debt was estimated using market prices, which were corroborated by quoted broker prices and significant other observable inputs.\nThe Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2020, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $\n10\nbillion, which expires on September 9, 2021.  Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either bids provided by banks, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Swap Curve or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreements are not material.\nThroughout fiscal year 2020, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market. Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $\n2.6\nbillion at the end of fiscal year 2020, of which $\n1.8\nbillion is the current portion of the long-term debt, and the remainder is commercial paper and local borrowings by international subsidiaries.\nThroughout fiscal year 2019, the Company continued to have access to liquidity through the commercial paper market.  Short-term borrowings and the current portion of long-term debt amounted to approximately $\n1.2\nbillion at the end of fiscal year 2019, of which $\n1.1\nbillion is the current portion of the long term debt, and the remainder principally represents local borrowing by international subsidiaries.\nAggregate maturities of long-term debt obligations commencing in 2021 are:\n8.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for taxes on income consists of:\n(1)\nIncludes $\n1.4\nbillion of deferred tax expense for the adoption of the deferred method to account for GILTI.\nA comparison of income tax expense at the U.S. statutory rate of\n21\n% in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, to the Company’s effective tax rate is as follows:\n(1) For all periods presented the Company has subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico under various tax incentives. International operations reflects the impacts of operations in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates different than the U.S., particularly Ireland, Switzerland and Puerto Rico, which is a favorable impact on the effective tax rate as compared with the U.S. statutory rate. The 2020 and 2019 amounts include the impact of the new tax legislation enactment in Switzerland, which is further described below.\n(2) Includes the impact of the GILTI tax, the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and other foreign income that is taxable under the U.S. tax code.\n(3) Represents impact of adjustments to balances originally recorded as part of the 2017 TCJA provisional tax charge. Further information provided below.\n(4) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\nThe fiscal year 2020 tax rate decreased by\n1.9\n% compared to the fiscal year 2019 tax rate, which was primarily driven by the following items. In fiscal year 2019, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF) which became effective on January 1, 2020. The Federal transitional provisions of TRAF allow companies, under certain conditions, to adjust the tax basis in certain assets to fair value (i.e., “step-up”) to be depreciated and amortized resulting in an incremental Swiss tax deduction over the transitional period.\nTRAF also provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations for companies. The new cantonal tax parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and additional research and development tax deductions. The cantonal transitional provisions of TRAF allowed companies to elect either 1) tax basis step-up similar to the Federal transition benefit or 2) alternative statutory tax rate for a period not to exceed 5 years. The Company currently has operations located in various Swiss cantons. During the fiscal year 2019, as described in further detail below, the Company recorded the impacts of the TRAF that were enacted in that period.\nDuring the fiscal year 2020, the final canton where the Company maintains significant operations enacted TRAF legislation. Additionally, the Company received rulings from the Swiss Federal and cantonal tax authorities in the remaining jurisdictions where it has significant operations. These rulings resulted in the Company revising its estimate on the tax basis adjustment (i.e., “step-up”) for its assets and as a result, the Company recorded additional deferred tax benefits in 2020. The Company recognized a net benefit in the fiscal year 2020 for Swiss Tax Reform of approximately $\n0.4\nbillion or\n2.6\n% benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following items:\n•\napproximately $\n0.3\nbillion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred in the fiscal year 2020; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\n•\na $\n450\nmillion deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s Swiss subsidiaries’ assets as described above; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\n•\napproximately $\n0.3\nbillion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. This benefit has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nThe Company does not expect to receive future rulings regarding the transitional provisions of TRAF.\nAlso, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized a capital loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the previously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2020 tax rate by approximately\n1.2\n% which is\nreflected as a “Tax Benefits on Capital Loss” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. In addition in the fiscal year 2020, the Company had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily driven by:\n•\nthe impact of the accrual of litigation costs related to Talc for $\n4.0\nbillion which reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of\n23.5\n%;\n•\nthe accrual of additional legal costs, including an additional $\n1.0\nbillion associated with a revised agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation at an effective tax rate of\n21.4\n%\nThe Company also generated additional tax benefits from stock-based compensation that were either exercised or vested; reduced the contingent consideration liability related to the Auris Health acquisition (see Note 18); and reversal of some of its unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of several years of tax examinations in certain jurisdictions during the fiscal year 2020.\nThe fiscal year 2019 tax rate decreased by\n2.3\n% compared to the fiscal year 2018 tax rate. In addition to the impact of TRAF discussed in more detail below, the primary drivers of the net decrease were as follows:\n•\nThe Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, which resulted in a reduction of certain withholding and local taxes that it had previously recognized as part of the provisional Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) tax charge in the fiscal year 2017 and finalized in the fiscal year 2018. Following the completion of this restructuring and approval by the applicable local authorities, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability of $\n0.6\nbillion and a related deferred tax asset of $\n0.2\nbillion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $\n0.4\nbillion decreasing the annual effective tax rate by\n2.2\n%. This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\n•\nThe impact of the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation for $\n4\nbillion (see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) which reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of\n23.5\n% and decreased the Company’s annual effective tax rate by approximately\n2.1\n%.\n•\nIn December of fiscal year 2019, the U.S. Treasury issued final foreign tax credit regulations, which resulted in the Company revising the amount of foreign tax credits that were initially recorded in the fiscal year 2017 as part of the provisional TCJA tax charge. As a result, the Company recorded an increased deferred tax asset related to these foreign tax credits of approximately $\n0.3\nbillion or\n1.7\n% to the annual effective tax rate.  This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\n•\nThe Company reassessed its uncertain tax positions related to the current IRS audit and increased its unrecognized tax benefit by $\n0.3\nbillion liability which increased the annual effective tax rate by approximately\n1.5\n% (see section on Unrecognized Tax Benefits for additional information). As these positions were related to uncertain tax regarding international transfer pricing, this expense has been classified as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. Subsequent to December 29, 2019, the Company received and agreed to Notices of Proposed Adjustments (NOPAs) from the IRS. The Company believes it is adequately reserved for potential exposures.\n•\nThere were several one-time tax impacts that resulted in a cumulative net tax benefit to the 2018 annual effective tax rate of\n1.2\n%. These items included the LifeScan divestiture, the adjustment to the 2017 provisional TCJA tax charge and the acceleration of certain tax deductions as part of the 2017 tax return.\n•\nMore income in higher tax jurisdictions relative to lower tax jurisdictions as compared to 2018.\nAs described above for the Swiss tax legislation, in the fiscal year 2019, the Company recorded a net tax expense of $\n0.1\nbillion which increased the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2019 by approximately\n0.6\n%. This net tax expense related to federal and certain cantonal enactments in the fiscal year 2019 consisting of the following provisions:\n•\napproximately $\n0.6\nbillion tax expense relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities for the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred by December 29, 2019; this expense has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\n•\na $\n0.9\nbillion deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s Swiss subsidiaries’ assets; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\n•\napproximately $\n450\nmillion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities and the new deferred tax asset for the Federal step-up. This benefit has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nIn the fiscal year 2018, the Company completed its full assessment and finalized the accounting for the impact of the TCJA. The Company recorded net adjustments to the above components of the provisional charge of approximately $\n0.2\nbillion. These revisions were based on updated estimates and additional analysis by management as well as applying interpretative guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury to the\nfacts and circumstances that existed as of the TCJA enactment date.\nThis charge was primarily related to additional deferred tax liabilities for foreign local and withholding taxes for the remaining balance of undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 that were not provided for in the 2017 provisional charge.\nAs described in Note 1, in the fiscal year 2018, the Company elected to treat GILTI as a period expense under the deferred method and recorded a deferred tax cost of approximately $\n1.4\nbillion in the fiscal year 2018 related to facts and circumstances that existed on the date of TCJA enactment. During 2018, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain foreign subsidiaries which resulted in a reduction of certain foreign withholding taxes that it had recognized as part of the provisional TCJA tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. Following the completion of this restructuring and as a result of clarification by Swiss tax authorities regarding the applicability of withholding tax to repatriation of certain earnings, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability of $\n2.8\nbillion and a related deferred tax asset of $\n0.9\nbillion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $\n1.9\nbillion. This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nTemporary differences and carryforwards at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n*\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation\nThe Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses.  The Company believes that it is more likely than not that these subsidiaries will generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize these deferred tax assets.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits:\nThe unrecognized tax benefits of $\n3.4\nbillion at January 3, 2021, if recognized, would affect the Company’s annual effective tax rate. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a number of tax authorities. With respect to the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its audit for the tax years through 2012. As of December 29, 2019, the Company classified unrecognized tax benefits and related interest\nof  approximately $\n0.9\nbillion as a current liability on the “Accrued taxes on Income” line of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In the fiscal year 2020, the Company made its final payments for approximately $\n0.7\nbillion to the U.S. Treasury related to the final settlement of 2010-2012 tax audit liability.\nIn other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back to the year 2006. The Company believes it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States. However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities, except as previously noted on amounts related to the current United States IRS audit. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $\n32\nmillion, $\n50\nmillion and $\n53\nmillion in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $\n468\nmillion and $\n559\nmillion in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n9.\nEmployee Related Obligations\nAt the end of fiscal 2020 and fiscal  2019, employee related obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were:\nPrepaid employee related obligations of $\n656\nmillion and $\n551\nmillion for 2020 and 2019, respectively, are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n10.\nPensions and Other Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily health care, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents.\nMany international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant.\nIn the U.S, non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the employee’s compensation during the last\nfive years\nbefore retirement and the number of years of service (the Final Average Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are calculated using a different formula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula).\nIn January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees,\nregardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the benefits\naccrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026. The impact of this change decreases the\nPBO as of January 3, 2021 by approximately $\n1.8\nbillion and is included in the “Amendments” line in the Change in Benefit Obligation.\nInternational subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided.\nThe Company does not fund retiree health care benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the future.\nIn 2020 and 2019 the Company used\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\nDecember 31, 2019\n, respectively, as the measurement date for all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans.\nNet periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2020, 2019 and 2018 include the following components:\nUnrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service for each plan.  For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The amortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a\n10\n% corridor of the greater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains and losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.\nPrior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is amortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan amendment.\nThe following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions:\nThe Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-term fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities. The Company's methodology in determining service and interest cost uses duration specific spot rates along that yield curve to the plans' liability cash flows.\nThe expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on diversified investment portfolios globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial sources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the various asset class allocations by market.\nThe following table displays the assumed health care cost trend rates, for all individuals:\nThe following table sets forth information related to the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets at fiscal year-end 2020 and 2019 for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other post-retirement plans:\nThe Company plans to continue to fund its U.S. Qualified Plans to comply with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. International Plans are funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions are made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans. For certain plans, funding is not a common practice, as funding provides no economic benefit. Consequently, the Company has several pension plans that are not funded.\nIn 2020, the Company contributed $\n441\nmillion and $\n429\nmillion to its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively.\nThe following table displays the funded status of the Company's U.S. Qualified & Non-Qualified pension plans and international funded and unfunded pension plans at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively:\nPlans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets have an accumulated benefit obligation, projected benefit obligation and plan assets of $\n8.8\nbillion, $\n9.8\nbillion and $\n4.4\nbillion, respectively, at the end of 2020, and $\n4.3\nbillion, $\n5.2\nbillion and $\n0.9\nbillion, respectively, at the end of 2019.\nThe following table displays the projected future benefit payments from the Company’s retirement and other benefit plans:\nThe following table displays the projected future minimum contributions to the unfunded retirement plans.  These amounts do not include any discretionary contributions that the Company may elect to make in the future.\nEach pension plan is overseen by a local committee or board that is responsible for the overall administration and investment of the pension plans. In determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board considers factors including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax regulations; availability of investment vehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of actives to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of local markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority of the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants and are expected to be on-going plans. Permitted investments are primarily liquid and/or listed, with little reliance on illiquid and non-traditional investments such as hedge funds.\nThe Company’s retirement plan asset allocation at the end of 2020 and 2019 and target allocations for 2021 are as follows:\nDetermination of Fair Value of Plan Assets\nThe Plan has an established and well-documented process for determining fair values.  Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon models that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nWhile the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation Hierarchy\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest.\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.\n•\nShort-term investment funds\n— Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the amount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and classified as Level 2.\n•\nGovernment and agency securities\n— A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not available in an active market, they are classified as Level 2.\n•\nDebt instruments\n— A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the investments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable inputs.\n•\nEquity securities\n— Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\n•\nCommingled funds\n— These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Assets in the Level 2 category have a quoted market price.\n•\nOther assets\n— Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded are classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2.\nThe following table sets forth the Retirement Plans' investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:\n(1)\nThe activity for the Level 3 assets is not significant for all years presented.\nThe Company's Other Benefit Plans are unfunded except for U.S. commingled funds (Level 2) of $\n90\nmillion and $\n84\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively and U.S. short-term investment funds (Level 2) of $\n31\nmillion at December 31, 2019.\nThe fair value of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock directly held in plan assets was $\n946\nmillion (\n2.5\n% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2020 and $\n984\nmillion (\n3.1\n% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2019.\n11.\nSavings Plan\nThe Company has voluntary 401(k) savings plans designed to enhance the existing retirement programs covering eligible employees. The Company matches a percentage of each employee’s contributions consistent with the provisions of the plan for which he/she is eligible. Total Company matching contributions to the plans were $\n243\nmillion, $\n235\nmillion and $\n242\nmillion in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n12.\nCapital and Treasury Stock\nChanges in treasury stock were:\nAggregate shares of common stock issued were approximately\n3,119,843,000\nshares at the end of fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nCash dividends paid were $\n3.98\nper share in fiscal year 2020, compared with dividends of $\n3.75\nper share in fiscal year 2019, and $\n3.54\nper share in fiscal year 2018.\nOn January 4, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $\n1.01\nper share, payable on March 9, 2021 to shareholders of record as of February 23, 2021.\nOn December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $\n5.0\nbillion of the Company's shares of common stock. This share repurchase program was completed as of September 29, 2019.\n13.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nComponents of other comprehensive income (loss) consist of the following:\n(1)\nPer the adoption of ASU 2016-01- Financial Instruments\nAmounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are presented net of the related tax impact. Foreign currency translation is not adjusted for income taxes where it relates to permanent investments in international subsidiaries. For additional details on comprehensive income see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nDetails on reclassifications out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income:\nGain/(Loss) On Securities - reclassifications released to Other (income) expense, net.\nEmployee Benefit Plans - reclassifications are included in net periodic benefit cost. See Note 10 for additional details.\nGain/(Loss) On Derivatives & Hedges - reclassifications to earnings are recorded in the same account as the hedged transaction.  See Note 6 for additional details.\n14.\nInternational Currency Translation\nFor translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. For the majority of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency.\nIn consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The other current and non current assets line within the Statement of Cash flows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those located in highly inflationary economies, (Argentina and Venezuela). The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results.\nA rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13.\nNet currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $\n209\nmillion, $\n267\nmillion and $\n265\nmillion in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n15.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021, December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018:\nThe diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2020 excluded\n18\nmillion shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was greater than their average market value. As of January 3, 2021, the Company did not have convertible debt.\nThe diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019 excluded an insignificant number of shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was greater than the average market value of the Company’s stock. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019 included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that was offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $\n1\nmillion after-tax.\nThe diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2018 included all shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of all options was less than the average market value of the Company's stock. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2018 included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that was offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $\n1\nmillion after-tax.\n16.\nCommon Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements\nAt January 3, 2021, the Company had\n2\nstock-based compensation plans.  The shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to\n650\nmillion shares of common stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan subsequent to April 26, 2012.  Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were\n277\nmillion at the end of fiscal year 2020.\nThe compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $\n1,005\nmillion, $\n977\nmillion and $\n978\nmillion for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation costs was $\n210\nmillion, $\n227\nmillion and $\n192\nmillion for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $\n248\nmillion, $\n209\nmillion and $\n264\nmillion for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for which options were exercised or restricted shares were vested. The total\nunrecognized compensation cost was $\n804\nmillion, $\n823\nmillion and $\n827\nmillion for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was\n1.76\nyears,\n1.71\nyears and\n1.73\nyears for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods.\nThe Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through market purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.\nStock Options\nStock options expire\n10\nyears from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from\n6\nmonths to\n4\nyears.  All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant.\nThe fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2020, 2019 and 2018 grants, expected volatility represents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied volatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants, historical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nThe average fair value of options granted was $\n16.42\n, $\n17.80\nand $\n17.98\n, in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The fair value was estimated based on the weighted average assumptions of:\nA summary of option activity under the Plan as of January 3, 2021, December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, and changes during the years ending on those dates is presented below:\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was $\n1,021\nmillion, $\n807\nmillion and $\n1,028\nmillion in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes stock options outstanding and exercisable at January 3, 2021:\n(1)\nAverage contractual life remaining in years.\nStock options outstanding at December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 were\n111,637\nand an average life of\n6.0\nyears and\n109,652\nand an average life of\n6.2\nyears, respectively. Stock options exercisable at December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018 were\n60,761\nat an average price of $\n88.88\nand\n54,862\nat an average price of $\n82.03\n, respectively.\nRestricted Share Units and Performance Share Units\nThe Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from\n6\nmonths to\n3\nyears. The Company also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock after the end of a\nthree-year\nperformance period. Whether any performance share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is tied to the completion of service periods that range from\n6\nmonths to\n3\nyears and the achievement, over a\nthree-year\nperiod, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, performance shares were granted with two equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The number of shares actually earned at the end of the\nthree-year\nperiod will vary, based only on actual performance, from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of the target number of performance share units granted\n.\nA summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of January 3, 2021 is presented below:\nThe average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $\n139.58\n, $\n121.31\nand $\n119.67\nin fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, using the fair market value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units during the vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $\n650\nmillion, $\n586\nmillion and $\n614\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $\n160.54\n, $\n124.67\nand $\n120.64\nin fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, calculated using the weighted average fair market value for each of the component goals at the date of grant.\nThe fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value of performance share units issued was $\n91\nmillion, $\n119\nmillion and $\n129\nmillion in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n17.\nSegments of Business* and Geographic Areas\n(3)\nPreviously referred to as Spine & Other\n*Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation\n**Percentage greater than 100% or not meaningful\nSee Note 1 for a description of the segments in which the Company operates.\nExport sales are not significant.

These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $\n7.5\nbillion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\nThe fiscal year 2020 acquisitions primarily included: all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc. (XBiotech), Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta), a company that discovers and develops novel therapies for immune-mediated diseases and the outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant  robotics and data science capabilities.\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc., for a purchase price of $\n0.8\nbillion. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $\n0.8\nbillion applying a probability of success factor that ranged from\n20\n% to\n60\n% to reflect inherent development, regulatory and commercial risk for the different indications. The discount rate applied was approximately\n16\n%.  XBiotech may be eligible to receive additional payments upon the receipt of certain commercialization authorizations. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment.\nAdditionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science capabilities, including those shares previously held by Verily. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $\n0.4\nbillion, goodwill for $\n0.2\nbillion, other assets of $\n0.2\nbillion and liabilities assumed of $\n0.3\nbillion. The fair value of the Company's previously held equity investment in Verb Surgical Inc. was $\n0.4\nbillion.\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Momenta for a purchase price of approximately $\n6.1\nbillion, net of cash acquired. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets (IPR&D) of $\n6.0\nbillion, goodwill of $\n1.2\nbillion, other assets of $\n0.5\nbillion and liabilities of $\n1.6\nbillion. The assets acquired are intended to address substantial unmet medical need in maternal-fetal disorders, neuro-inflammatory disorders, rheumatology, dermatology and autoimmune hematology. Depending on the asset, probability of success factors ranging from\n20\n% to\n77\n% were used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent development and regulatory risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately\n13\n%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment.\nDuring fiscal year 2019 certain businesses were acquired for $\n5.8\nbillion in cash and $\n1.4\nbillion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $\n6.8\nbillion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\nThe fiscal year 2019 acquisitions primarily included DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products and Auris Health, Inc. a privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.\nOn January 17, 2019, the Company acquired DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products for a total purchase price of approximately ¥\n230\nbillion, which equates to approximately $\n2.1\nbillion, using the exchange rate of\n109.06\nJapanese Yen to each U.S. Dollar on January 16, 2019. Additionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $\n0.3\nbillion related to the Company's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO.\nThe Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Consumer Health segment.  During the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. The final fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable intangible assets for $\n1.5\nbillion, goodwill for $\n1.2\nbillion and liabilities of $\n0.4\nbillion. The amortizable intangible assets were comprised of brand/trademarks and customer relationships with a weighted average life of\n15.3\nyears The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nOn April 1, 2019 the Company completed the acquisition of Auris Health, Inc. for approximately $\n3.4\nbillion, net of cash acquired. Additional contingent payments of up to $\n2.35\nbillion, in the aggregate, may be payable upon reaching certain predetermined milestones. Auris Health was a privately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable and non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D for $\n3.0\nbillion, goodwill for $\n2.0\nbillion, marketable securities of $\n0.2\nbillion and liabilities assumed of $\n1.8\nbillion, which includes the fair value of the contingent payments mentioned above. During the fiscal second quarter of 2020, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. During fiscal 2020, the Company recorded Other income of approximately $\n1.1\nbillion for the reversal of all of the contingent consideration related to the timing of certain developmental and commercial milestones, which are not expected to be met based on the Company’s current timelines. During the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a partial IPR&D impairment charge of $\n0.1\nbillion related to timing and progression of the digital surgery platforms. A probability of success factor ranging from\n55\n% to\n95\n% was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the contingent payments and IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately\n10\n%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nDuring fiscal year 2018 certain businesses were acquired for $\n0.9\nbillion in cash and $\n0.1\nbillion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $\n1.0\nbillion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets, supplemental pro forma information for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 is not provided, as the impact of the aforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nDivestitures\nSubsequent to fiscal 2020, in separate transactions, the Company divested two brands outside the U.S. within the Pharmaceutical segment and received combined proceeds of approximately $\n0.6\nbillion. The Company will reflect these brand divestitures in its 2021 financial results.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Company sold\n11.8\nmillion shares of Idorsia LTD (Idorsia), or its\n8.3\n% ownership in the company. The transaction resulted in gross proceeds of approximately CHF\n337\nmillion ($\n357\nmillion) based on a sales price of CHF\n28.55\n/share and an immaterial net loss. The Company currently has rights to at least an additional\n38.7\nmillion shares (or approximately\n20\n% of Idorsia equity) through a convertible loan with a principal amount of CHF\n445\nmillion (due June 2027). Idorsia also has access to an approximate CHF\n243\nmillion credit facility with the Company. As of January 3, 2021, Idorsia has not made any draw-downs under the credit facility.\nDuring fiscal year 2019, the Company divested its ASP business to Fortive Corporation for an aggregate value of approximately $\n2.8\nbillion, consisting of $\n2.7\nbillion of cash proceeds and $\n0.1\nbillion of retained net receivables. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other ( income) expense, net, of approximately $\n2.0\nbillion.\nDuring fiscal year 2018, the Company divested the LifeScan Inc business for approximately $\n2.1\nbillion and retained certain net liabilities. Other divestitures in fiscal year 2018 included: NIZORAL\n®\n, RoC\n®\nand certain non-strategic Pharmaceutical products. In 2018, the pre-tax gains on the divestitures were approximately $\n1.2\nbillion.\nIn fiscal year 2018, the Company accepted a binding offer to form a strategic collaboration with Jabil Inc., one of the world’s leading manufacturing services providers for health care products and technology products. The Company is expanding a 12-year relationship with Jabil to produce a range of products within the Ethicon Endo-Surgery and DePuy Synthes businesses. This transaction includes the transfer of employees and manufacturing sites. The transfers were completed in fiscal year 2020. As of January 3, 2021, there were no assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 29, 2019, the assets held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet were $\n0.1\nbillion of inventory and property, plant and equipment, net. For additional details on the global supply chain restructuring see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n19.\nLegal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability; intellectual property; commercial; supplier indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business. Due to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain trials have been rescheduled or delayed. The Company continues to monitor its legal proceedings as the situation evolves.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 3, 2021, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nPRODUCT LIABILITY\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.\nThe most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; the PINNACLE\n®\nAcetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL\n®\n; XARELTO\n®\n; body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSONS\n®\nBaby Powder; INVOKANA\n®\n; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESH\n®\nFlexible Composite Mesh. As of January 3, 2021, in the United States there were approximately\n560\nplaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding\ninjuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System;\n7,800\nwith respect to the PINNACLE\n®\nAcetabular Cup System;\n14,900\nwith respect to pelvic meshes;\n9,300\nwith respect to RISPERDAL\n®\n;\n12,600\nwith respect to XARELTO\n®\n;\n25,000\nwith respect to body powders containing talc;\n300\nwith respect to INVOKANA\n®\n;\nand\n4,200\nwith respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH\n®\nFlexible Composite Mesh.\nIn August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR\n™\nXL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR\n™\nHip Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 31, 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 31, 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than\n10,000\nclaims, therefore bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle\nthe class actions filed in that country\n. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and DePuy ASR\n™\nHip-related product liability litigation.\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson (collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE\n®\nAcetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation has also been filed in some state courts and in countries outside of the United States. Several adverse verdicts have been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for retrial. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE\n®\nAcetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. The MDL Court is remanding cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved a majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining cases are reflected in the Company's accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and class actions in Israel, Australia and Canada, seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices.  In November 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to liability in relation to the three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market assessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In March 2020, the Court entered damages awards to the three Lead Applicants. The Company is appealing the decision. With respect to other group members, there will be an individual case assessment process which will require proof of use and causally related loss.  The form of the individual case assessment process has not yet been determined by the Court. The class actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020 as a result of a settlement of a group of cases. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon's pelvic mesh product\ns.\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH\n®\nFlexible Composite Mesh, claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device.  Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) has also been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending outside the United States. Discovery is proceeding in these cases and certain of the cases are in preparation for trials.\nClaims have also been filed against Ethicon and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED\n®\nMesh and PROCEED\n®\nVentral Patch hernia mesh products.\nIn March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the US, and in jurisdictions outside the US. Discovery is underway in these cases.\nIn September 2019, plaintiffs’ attorney filed an application with the New Jersey Supreme Court seeking centralized management of 107 PROLENE™ Polypropylene Hernia System (“PHS”) cases. The New Jersey Supreme Court granted plaintiffs application in January 2020 and those cases have also been transferred to an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Discovery is underway in these cases.\nThe Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON PHYSIOMESH\n®\nFlexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED\n®\nMesh and PROCEED\n®\nVentral Patch, and PROLENE™ Polypropylene Hernia System products.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of RISPERDAL\n®\n, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the United States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October 2019 of $\n8.0\nbillion of punitive damages related to one single plaintiff which was subsequently reduced in January 2020 to $\n6.8\nmillion by the trial judge. The Company and plaintiff are each appealing this judgment. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved many of the United States cases and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company's accruals.\nClaims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO\n®\n, an oral anticoagulant, have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI); Johnson & Johnson (J&J); and JPI’s collaboration partner for XARELTO\n®\n, Bayer AG and certain of its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases have been filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases were consolidated into a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in a coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and J&J announced an agreement in principle to the settle the XARELTO\n®\ncases in the United States; the settlement agreement was executed in May 2019, the settlement became final in December 2019, and the settlement was funded in January 2020. This resolved the majority of cases pending in the United States. The Company has established accruals for its costs associated with the United States settlement program and XARELTO\n®\nrelated product liability litigation.\nPersonal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been made against Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S\n®\nBaby Powder. The number of pending personal injury lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state courts in Missouri, New Jersey and California, and suits have also been filed outside the United States. The majority of cases are pending in federal court, organized into a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the MDL, the parties sought to exclude experts through Daubert motions. In April 2020, the Court issued rulings that limit the scope of testimony, including some theories and testing methods, for certain plaintiff expert witnesses and denied  plaintiffs’ attempt to limit the scope of testimony of certain of the Company’s witnesses. With this ruling made, case-specific discovery has begun per the Court’s directive.\nIn talc cases that have previously gone to trial, the Company has obtained defense verdicts in a number of them, but there have also been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018  verdict of $\n4.7\nbillion in\nIngham v. Johnson & Johnson, et al.,\nNo. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $\n2.1\nbillion and, with additional interest as of January 3, 2021, as the Company pursues further appeal, is currently $\n2.5\nbillion (the\nIngham\ndecision). An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and the Company is currently seeking review by the United States Supreme Court. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds for the appeal of this verdict, as well as other verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has and may settle cases. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs and reserves for the resolution of certain cases and claims, including the\nIngham\ndecision currently on appeal\n,\nin connection with product liability litigation associated with body powders containing talc.\nIn February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary chapter 11 petition commencing a reorganization under\nthe United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’ potential liability for personal injury from exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys (Talc Claims). In its bankruptcy filing, Imerys noted certain claims it alleges it has against the Company for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. The Company previously proposed to resolve Imerys' (and the Company’s) obligations arising out of the Talc Claims by agreeing to assume the defense of litigation of all Talc Claims involving the Company's products, waiving the Company’s indemnification claims against Imerys, and lifting the automatic stay to enable the Talc Claims to proceed outside the bankruptcy forum with the Company agreeing to settle or pay any judgment against Imerys. In May 2020, Imerys and the asbestos claimants’ committee (Plan Proponents) filed their Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) and the Disclosure Statement related thereto agreeing to put its North American operations up for auction which was subsequently amended. The Company has objected to the Disclosure Statement and intends to object to the Plan of Reorganization as currently structured. Additionally, in June 2020, Cyprus Mines Corporation and its parent (Cyprus) filed an adversary proceeding against the Company as well as Imerys seeking a declaration of indemnity under certain contractual agreements.  The Company denies such indemnification is owed and filed a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint arguing, among other things, that the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over Cyprus’s claims against the Company. The Plan Proponents filed numerous amendments to the Plan and Disclosure Statement to which the Company objected. A hearing on the Plan Proponent’s Disclosure Statement was held in January 2021, and the Court entered an order approving the Disclosure Statement for the Ninth Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Imerys Talc America, Inc. and its Debtor Affiliates allowing Debtors to proceed with soliciting votes on the Plan. The Company intends to continue to object to the Plan. A hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan has been scheduled for June 2021.\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Johnson & Johnson violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder, and that purchasers of Johnson & Johnson’s shares suffered losses as a result. Plaintiff is seeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion was complete as of August 2019. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In March 2020, Defendants answered the complaint. Discovery is underway.\nIn June 2019, a shareholder filed a complaint initiating a summary proceeding in New Jersey state court for a books and records inspection. In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson responded to the books and records complaint and filed a cross motion to dismiss. In September 2019, Plaintiff replied and the Court heard oral argument. The Court has not yet ruled in the books and records action. In October 2019, December 2019, and January 2020, four shareholders filed four separate derivative lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and its current directors and certain officers as defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties related to the alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S\n®\nBaby Powder, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. In February 2020, the four cases were consolidated into a single action under the caption\nIn re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation\n.\nIn July 2020, a report was delivered to the Company’s Board of Directors by independent counsel retained by the Board to investigate the allegations in the derivative lawsuits and in a series of shareholder letters that the Board received raising similar issues. Four of the shareholders who sent demands are plaintiffs in th\ne\nIn re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation\n.\nThe independent counsel recommended that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal of the derivative lawsuits. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel’s report. In October 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated complaint, and in January 2021, Johnson & Johnson moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint.\nIn January 2019, two ERISA class action lawsuits were filed by participants in the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan against Johnson & Johnson, its Pension and Benefits Committee, and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by offering Johnson & Johnson stock as a Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan investment option when it was imprudent to do so because of failures to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S\n®\nBaby Powder. Plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. In September 2019, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In April 2020, the Court granted Defendants’ motion but granted leave to amend. In June 2020, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and in July 2020, Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. As of October 2020, briefing on Defendants’ motion was complete\n.\nA lawsuit pending in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging violations of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act relating to JOHNSON’S\n®\nBaby Powder has been resolved in the Company’s favor. In that lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege that Johnson & Johnson violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65 warnings.  In July 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In response to those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In December 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In April 2020, the Court granted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Complaint but indicated that they would be filing a motion for leave to file a fifth amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed a Fifth Amended Complaint in August 2020. The Company moved to dismiss the Fifth Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In January 2021, the Court issued an Order and opinion ruling in the Company’s favor and granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice.\nIn January 2020, the Abtahi Law Group filed an action under Proposition 65 against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. as well as a number of other alleged talcum powder manufacturers and distributors, including one California company. In that action, the plaintiff alleges contamination of talcum powder products with unsafe levels of arsenic, hexavalent chromium and lead. The plaintiff seeks civil penalties and injunctive relief. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment in January 2021, and a hearing has been scheduled for April 2021. Limited informal discovery is continuing.\nIn addition, the Company has received preliminary inquiries and subpoenas to produce documents regarding these matters from Senator Murray, a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Congressional Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy. The Company produced documents as required in response and will continue to cooperate with government inquiries. In November 2020, the SEC terminated its investigation.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson, arising out of the use of INVOKANA\n®\n, a prescription medication indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes. In December 2016, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United States were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Cases have also been filed in state courts. Class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved many of the cases and claims in the United States and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the Company's accruals.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson, arising out of the use of ELMIRON\n®\n, a prescription medication  indicated for the relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that ELMIRON\n®\ncontributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state and federal courts across the United States. In December 2020, the federal cases, including two putative class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In addition, three class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has established accruals for defense costs associated with ELMIRON\n®\nrelated product liability litigation.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nCertain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset. Significant matters are described below.\nMedical Devices\nIn November 2016, MedIdea, L.L.C. (MedIdea) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging infringement by the ATTUNE\n®\nKnee System. In April 2017, MedIdea filed an amended complaint adding DePuy Synthes Products, Inc. and DePuy Synthes Sales, Inc. as named defendants (collectively, DePuy).

Specifically, MedIdea alleges that the SOFCAM\nTM\nContact feature of the ATTUNE\n®\nposterior stabilized knee products infringes the patents-in-suit. MedIdea is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. In June 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. In November 2019, judgment was entered in favor of DePuy. In January 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed.\nIn December 2016, Dr. Ford Albritton sued Acclarent, Inc.

These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents. In the event the subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic statutory stay of the ANDAs expires before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the FDA, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the\nUSPTO, created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the applicable patents.\nZYTIGA\n®\nIn November 2017, Janssen Inc. and Janssen Oncology Inc.

Such regulation has been the basis of government investigations and litigations. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by, government agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.\nAverage Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation\nJohnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving allegations\nthat the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. The case brought by Illinois was settled after trial.  In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation. All other cases have been resolved.\nOpioid Litigation\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in more than\n3,100\nlawsuits related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC\n®\n, NUCYNTA\n®\nand NUCYNTA\n®\nER. The suits also raise allegations related to previously owned active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both subsidiaries were divested in 2016). The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local governments. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children suffering from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and health insurers/payors. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson and JPI, have been filed by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Washington and West Virginia. Complaints against the manufacturers also have been filed in state or federal court by city, county and local government agencies in the following states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina; Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

There are over 2,800 federal cases coordinated in a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (MDL No. 2804). In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit in Canada. In October 2019, an anti-trust complaint was filed by private plaintiffs in federal court in Tennessee and is pending transfer to the MDL. These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the plaintiffs are seeking joint and several liability among the defendants. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions.\nThe trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against Johnson & Johnson and JPI in the amount of $\n572\nmillion, subject to a final order to be issued by the Court. The Court issued a final judgment reducing the amount to $\n465\nmillion. Johnson & Johnson and JPI have appealed the judgment. The Company believes that it has strong grounds to overturn this judgment. In October 2019 Johnson & Johnson and JPI announced a settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with two counties in Ohio.\nJohnson & Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information related to opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In September 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were contacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation. In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $\n4\nbillion as settlement of these matters. In October 2020, the Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $\n1\nbillion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $\n5\nbillion which has been accrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement in principle is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing and would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities and counties. The Company cannot predict if or when the agreement will be finalized and individual cases are ongoing.\nIn August 2019, Johnson & Johnson received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York for documents related to the Company’s anti-diversion policies and procedures and distribution of its\nopioid medications, in what the Company understands to be part of a broader investigation into manufacturers’ and distributors’ monitoring programs and reporting under the Controlled Substances Act. In September 2019, Johnson & Johnson received subpoenas from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) as part of an industry-wide inquiry into the effect of opioid prescriptions on New York health insurance premiums. In September 2020, the Company learned that NYDFS filed a statement of charges related to this investigation.\nFrom June 2017 through December 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors received a series of shareholder demand letters alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained independent counsel to investigate the allegations in the demands, and i\nn April 2020, independent counsel delivered a report to the Board recommending that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal of related derivative litigation.\nThe Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel’s report.\nIn November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. In May 2020, the shareholder filed an amended complaint challenging the Board’s rejection of his demand. In August 2020, Johnson & Johnson moved to dismiss the amended complaint, and as of December 2020, that motion was fully briefed. In August 2020, another shareholder who sent a demand filed a separate derivative complaint in the same court making similar allegations. In October 2020, the Court granted defendants’ request to reassign the second-filed case to the division where the first-filed case is pending.\nIn December 2019, two additional shareholders who sent demands filed two separate derivative complaints making similar allegations against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the United States District for the District of New Jersey. In April 2020, the two federal cases were consolidated into a single action captioned\nIn re Johnson & Johnson Opioid Stockholder Derivative Litigation\n. In July 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated complaint. In September 2020, Johnson & Johnson moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint, and in December 2020, the shareholders opposed Johnson & Johnson’s motion. Johnson & Johnson filed its reply in February 2021. In July 2020, an additional shareholder who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint in the same federal court making similar allegations against the same defendants named in the consolidated action. In January 2021, pursuant to an order in the consolidated action, the third case was consolidated into the consolidated action. In February 2021, the shareholders in the consolidated action filed a motion for voluntary dismissal.\nOther\nIn August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now known as DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc. (collectively DePuy) received an informal request from the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United States) for the production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR™ XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a\nqui tam\ncase filed pursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies. In February 2016, the district court granted the companies’ motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the\nqui tam\ncomplaint, and denied the\nqui tam\nrelators’ request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The\nqui tam\nrelators appealed the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal in part, reversed in part, and affirmed the decision to deny the relators’ request to file a third amended complaint. The relators’ remaining claims are now pending before the district court. In July 2020, the Court ordered the relators to complete discovery by August 2020; the Relators have requested an extension of the August 2020 deadline that DePuy opposed and additional discovery-related motions have been filed by both parties. Additionally, DePuy has requested a schedule for the filing of a motion to strike and to dismiss the relators’ second amended complaint.\nIn October 2012, Johnson & Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General's office regarding a multi-state Attorney General investigation of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes by Johnson & Johnson's subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). In May 2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints against Johnson & Johnson, Ethicon and Ethicon US, LLC alleging violations of their consumer protection statutes. Similar complaints were filed against the companies by the following states:  Kentucky, Mississippi, West Virginia and Oregon. In April 2019, Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon settled the Washington case. The California case started trial in July 2019 and concluded in September 2019. The trial date for the Kentucky case was scheduled for September 2019 but has been adjourned and no new trial date has been scheduled. In October 2019, Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon settled the multi-state investigation with 41 other states and the District of Columbia. In January 2020, the Court in California issued a statement of decision, finding in favor of the State of California, and awarded civil penalties in the amount of $\n344\nmillion. In April 2020, the Court in California denied the Company's motion for a new trial. In August 2020, the Court entered judgment with respect to the penalties of $\n344\nmillion, but denied the Attorney General’s request for injunctive relief. The Company is appealing the\npenalty judgment. In April 2020, the\nCompany settled the West Virginia. In October 2020, the Company settled with the Attorney General of Oregon.  In November 2020, the Company settled with the Attorney General of Mississippi.\nIn December 2012, Therakos, Inc. (Therakos), formerly a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson and part of the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (OCD) franchise, received a letter from the civil division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania informing Therakos that the United States Attorney's Office was investigating the sales and marketing of Uvadex\n®\n(methoxsalen) and the Uvar Xts\n®\nand Cellex\n®\nSystems during the period 2000 to the present. The United States Attorney's Office requested that OCD and Johnson & Johnson preserve documents that could relate to the investigation. Therakos was subsequently acquired by an affiliate of Gores Capital Partners III, L.P. in January 2013, and OCD was divested in June 2014. Following the divestiture of OCD, Johnson & Johnson retained OCD’s portion of any liability resulting from the investigation for activity that occurred prior to the sale of Therakos. Following production of documents to and settlement discussions with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, J&J affiliate Medical Device Business Services, Inc. agreed to resolve claims under the federal False Claims Act and analogous state laws in a settlement announced in November  2020. In the settlement agreement, Medical Device Business Services expressly denied any wrongful conduct. As a result of the settlement, a qui tam complaint filed by two relators pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania will be dismissed. Separate settlement agreements with the states participating in the settlement are in the process of being finalized.\nIn June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc.

The Global Supply Chain actions include expanding the use of strategic collaborations and bolstering initiatives to reduce complexity, improve cost-competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize the Supply Chain network. For additional details on the Global Supply Chain restructuring strategic collaborations see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $\n0.4\nbillion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $\n0.2\nbillion in restructuring, $\n0.1\nbillion in other (income) expense and $\n0.1\nbillion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $\n1.3\nbillion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. See the following table for additional details on the restructuring program.\nIn total, the Company expects the Global Supply Chain actions to generate approximately $\n0.6\nbillion to $\n0.8\nbillion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $\n1.9\nbillion to $\n2.3\nbillion, over the\n4\nto\n5\nyear period of this activity. These costs are associated with network optimizations, exit costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization.\nThe following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending under these initiatives through the fiscal year ended 2020:\n(1)\nCash outlays for severance are expected to be substantially paid out over the next\n2\nyears in accordance with the Company's plans and local laws.\n(2)\nOther includes project expense such as salaries for employees supporting these initiatives and consulting expenses.\n(3)\nRelates to pension related net actuarial losses associated with the transfer of employees to Jabil Inc. as part of the strategic collaboration.\n(4)\nRepresents gain on sale of an asset\nThe Company continuously reevaluates its severance reserves related to restructuring and the timing of payments due to the planned release of associates regarding several longer-term projects. The Company believes that the existing severance reserves are sufficient to cover the Global Supply Chain plans given the period over which the actions will take place. The Company will continue to assess and make adjustments as necessary if additional amounts become probable and estimable.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson & Johnson\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 3, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 3, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nU.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves – Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such rebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.2 billion as of January 3, 2021. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related to contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing an independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend analysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and (iii) comparing the independent estimates to management’s estimates.\nLitigation Contingencies – Talc\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. There have been verdicts against the Company for this matter, including a verdict in July 2018 of $4.7 billion, which was reversed in part and affirmed in part by the Missouri Court of Appeals in June 2020, reducing the overall award to $2.1 billion and, with additional interest as of January 3, 2021, as the Company pursues further appeal, is currently $2.5 billion. An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and the Company is currently seeking review by the United States Supreme Court. As described by management, the Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds for the appeal of this verdict, as well as other verdicts it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has and may settle cases. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs and reserves for settlement of certain cases and claims, as well as one case currently on appeal, in connection with product liability litigation associated with body powders containing talc.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and when\ndetermining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for each claim can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.\nLitigation – Opioids\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with legal matters, including opioids, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. The Company has been named in numerous lawsuits brought by certain state and local governments related to opioids matters. The trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against the Company in the amount of $572 million which was subsequently reduced to $465 million. The Company has appealed the judgment and, as described by management, believes that it has strong grounds to overturn this judgment. Separately in October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $4 billion as settlement of the lawsuits. In October 2020, the Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $1 billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $5 billion which has been accrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. As described by management, this agreement in principle is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing and would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities and counties.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the opioids litigation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred for the judgment against the Company in Oklahoma and when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the range of loss for the proposed agreement in principle to settle opioids litigation can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s evaluation of the opioid litigation, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process around the accounting and reporting for the opioids litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual and potential litigation and ongoing settlement negotiations with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\nFebruary 22, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1920. We have not been able to determine the specific year we began serving as auditor of the Company.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that assessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nInternal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations.  Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements.  Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2021.  In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).”  These criteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring.  The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.\nBased on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January 3, 2021, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.\nShareholder Return Performance Graphs\nSet forth below are line graphs comparing the cumulative total shareholder return on the Company’s Common Stock for periods of five years and ten years ending January 3, 2021, against the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index, the Standard & Poor’s Pharmaceutical Index and the Standard & Poor’s Health Care Equipment Index.

The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

The Company has not experienced any material impact to its internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that most of its employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company proactively took actions to re-evaluate and refine its financial reporting process through additional monitoring controls to provide reasonable assurance that the financial results are reported accurately and timely. The Company continues to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.\nThe Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions.
