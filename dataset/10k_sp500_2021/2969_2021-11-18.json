    "text": "Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., a Delaware corporation originally founded in 1940, serves customers globally with a unique portfolio of products, services, and solutions that include atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, equipment, and services. Focused on serving energy, environment and emerging markets, we provide essential industrial gases, related equipment, and applications expertise to customers in dozens of industries, including refining, chemicals, metals, electronics, manufacturing, and food and beverage. We are the world’s largest supplier of hydrogen and have built leading positions in growth markets such as helium and liquefied natural gas (\"LNG\") process technology and equipment. We develop, engineer, build, own, and operate some of the world’s largest industrial gas projects, including gasification projects that sustainably convert abundant natural resources into syngas for the production of high-value power, fuels, and chemicals and are developing carbon capture projects and world-scale low carbon and carbon-free hydrogen projects that will support global transportation and energy transition away from fossil fuels.\nAs used in this report, unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company,” \"Air Products,\" or “registrant” include controlled subsidiaries, affiliates, and predecessors of Air Products and our controlled subsidiaries and affiliates.\nExcept as otherwise noted, the description of our business below reflects our continuing operations. Refer to Note 5,\nDiscontinued Operations\n, to the consolidated financial statements for activity associated with discontinued operations.\n4\nDuring the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021 (“fiscal year 2021”), we reported our continuing operations in five reporting segments under which we managed our operations, assessed performance, and reported earnings: Industrial Gases – Americas; Industrial Gases – EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa); Industrial Gases – Asia; Industrial Gases – Global; and Corporate and other. The discussion that follows is based on those operations. Refer to Note 23,\nBusiness Segment and Geographic Information\n, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments.\nOn 4 November 2021, we announced the reorganization of our industrial gases segments effective 1 October 2021. Refer to Note 24,\nSubsequent Events\n, for additional information.\nIndustrial Gases Business\nOur Industrial Gases business produces atmospheric gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and argon; process gases, such as hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n), carbon monoxide, and syngas; and specialty gases. Atmospheric gases are produced through various air separation processes, of which cryogenic is the most prevalent. Process gases are produced by methods other than air separation. For example, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas are produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas and by the gasification of liquid and solid hydrocarbons. Hydrogen is produced by purifying byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries. Helium is produced as a byproduct of gases extracted from underground reservoirs, primarily natural gas, but also CO\n2\npurified before resale. The Industrial Gases business also develops, builds, and operates equipment for the production or processing of gases, such as air separation units and non-cryogenic generators.\nOur Industrial Gases business is organized and operated regionally. The regional Industrial Gases segments supply gases, related equipment, and applications in the relevant region to diversified customers in many industries, including those in refining, chemicals, metals, electronics, manufacturing, and food and beverage. Hydrogen is used by refiners to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels, as well as in the developing hydrogen-for-mobility markets. We have hydrogen fueling stations that support commercial markets in California and Japan as well as demonstration projects in Europe, Saudi Arabia, and other parts of Asia. The chemicals industry uses hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas as feedstocks in the production of many basic chemicals. The energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification. Oxygen is used in combustion and industrial heating applications, including in the steel, certain nonferrous metals, glass, and cement industries. Nitrogen applications are used in food processing for freezing and preserving flavor, and nitrogen is used for inerting in various fields, including the metals, chemical, and semiconductor industries. Helium is used in laboratories and healthcare for cooling and in other industries for pressurizing, purging, and lifting. Argon is used in the metals and other industries for its unique inerting, thermal conductivity, and other properties. Industrial gases are also used in welding and providing healthcare and are utilized in various manufacturing processes to make them more efficient and to optimize performance.\nIndustrial gases are generally produced at or near the point of use given the complexity and inefficiency with storing molecules at low temperatures. Helium, however, is generally sourced globally, at long distances from point of sale. As a result, we maintain an inventory of helium stored in our fleet of ISO containers as well as at the U.S. Bureau of Land Management underground storage facility in Amarillo, Texas.\n5\nWe distribute gases to our sale of gas customers through different supply modes depending on various factors including the customer's volume requirements and location. Our supply modes are as follows:\n•\nLiquid Bulk\n—Product is delivered in bulk (in liquid or gaseous form) by tanker or tube trailer and stored, usually in its liquid state, in equipment that we typically design and install at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed. Liquid bulk sales are usually governed by three- to five-year contracts.\n•\nPackaged Gases\n—Small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars. We operate packaged gas businesses in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. In the United States, our packaged gas business sells products (principally helium) only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging industries.\n•\nOn-Site Gases\n—Large quantities of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, and syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) are provided to customers, principally in the energy production and refining, chemical, and metals industries worldwide, that require large volumes of gases and have relatively constant demand. Gases are produced and supplied by large facilities we construct or acquire on or near the customers’ facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities. These sale of gas contracts are generally governed by 15- to 20-year contracts. We also deliver smaller quantities of product through small on-site plants (cryogenic or non-cryogenic generators), typically via a 10- to 15-year sale of gas contract.\nElectricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases. Steam methane reformers utilize natural gas as the primary raw material and gasifiers use liquid and solid hydrocarbons as the principal raw material for the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas. We mitigate electricity, natural gas, and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas, surcharges, and cost pass-through and tolling arrangements. During fiscal year 2021, no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of power and natural gas.\nWe obtain helium from a number of sources globally, including crude helium for purification from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's helium reserve.\nThe regional Industrial Gases segments also include our share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for by the equity method, which we report in our financial statements as income from equity affiliates. The largest of these joint ventures operate in China, India, Italy, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Thailand.\nEach of the regional Industrial Gases segments competes against three global industrial gas companies: Air Liquide S.A., Messer, and Linde plc, as well as regional competitors. Competition in Industrial Gases is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, and the development of industrial gas applications. We derive a competitive advantage in locations where we have pipeline networks, which enable us to provide reliable and economic supply of products to our larger customers.\nOverall regional industrial gases sales constituted approximately 92%, 94%, and 96% of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Sales of atmospheric gases constituted approximately 47%, 47%, and 46% of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, while sales of tonnage hydrogen, syngas, and related products constituted approximately 22%, 22%, and 26% of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n6\nIndustrial Gases Equipment\nWe design and manufacture equipment for air separation, hydrocarbon recovery and purification, natural gas liquefaction, and liquid helium and liquid hydrogen transport and storage. The Industrial Gases – Global segment includes activity primarily related to the sale of cryogenic and gas processing equipment for air separation. The equipment is sold worldwide to customers in a variety of industries, including chemical and petrochemical manufacturing, oil and gas recovery and processing, and steel and primary metals processing. The Corporate and other segment includes: our LNG equipment business, our Gardner Cryogenics business fabricating helium and hydrogen transport and storage containers, and our Rotoflow business, which manufactures turboexpanders and other precision rotating equipment. Steel, aluminum, and capital equipment subcomponents (compressors, etc.) are the principal raw materials in the manufacturing of equipment. Raw materials for individual projects typically are acquired under firm purchase agreements. Equipment is produced at our manufacturing sites with certain components being procured from subcontractors and vendors. Competition in the equipment business is based primarily on plant efficiency, service, technical know-how and price, as well as schedule and plant performance guarantees. Sale of equipment constituted approximately 8%, 6%, and 4% of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nOur backlog of equipment orders was approximately $1.3 billion on 30 September 2021 (as compared to a total backlog of approximately $1.6 billion on 30 September 2020). We estimate that approximately half of the total equipment sales backlog as of 30 September 2021 will be recognized as revenue during fiscal year 2022, dependent on execution schedules of the relevant projects.\nInternational Operations\nThrough our subsidiaries, affiliates, and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, we conduct business in 53 countries outside the United States. Our international businesses are subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls, tariffs, trade sanctions, and import and export controls, and other economic, political, and regulatory policies of local governments described in Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\n, below.\nWe have majority or wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that operate in Canada; 18 European countries (including the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom); 11 Asian countries (including China, South Korea, and Taiwan); seven Latin American countries (including Brazil and Chile); six countries in the Middle East (including Saudi Arabia), and three African countries. We also own less-than-controlling interests in entities operating in Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa (including China, India, Italy, Mexico, Oman, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Thailand).\nFinancial information about our foreign operations and investments is included in Note 7,\nSummarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates\n; Note 21,\nIncome Taxes\n; and Note 23,\nBusiness Segment and Geographic Information\n, to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, below. Information about foreign currency translation is included under “Foreign Currency” in Note 1,\nMajor Accounting Policies\n, and information on our exposure to currency fluctuations is included in Note 12,\nFinancial Instruments\n, to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8, below, and in “Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk,” included under Item 7A, below.\nTechnology Development\nWe pursue a market-oriented approach to technology development through research and development, engineering, and commercial development processes. We conduct research and development principally in our laboratories located in the United States (Trexlertown, Pennsylvania), the United Kingdom (Basingstoke and Carrington), Spain (Barcelona), China (Shanghai), and Saudi Arabia (Dhahran). We also fund and cooperate in research and development programs conducted by a number of major universities and undertake research work funded by others, including the United States government.\nDevelopment of technology for use within the Industrial Gases business focuses primarily on new and improved processes and equipment for the production and delivery of industrial gases and new or improved applications for industrial gas products.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we owned approximately 780 United States patents, approximately 3,480 foreign patents, and were a licensee under certain patents owned by others. While the patents and licenses are considered important, we do not consider our business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any particular patent, patent license, or group of patents or licenses.\n7\nEnvironmental Regulation\nWe are subject to various environmental laws, regulations, and public policies in the countries in which we have operations. Compliance with these measures often results in higher capital expenditures and costs. In the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA,\" the federal Superfund law); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\"); and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1,\nMajor Accounting Policies\n, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 16,\nCommitments and Contingencies\n, to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8, below.\nSome of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHG”), including CO\n2\n. These include existing coverage under the European Union Emission Trading System, the California Cap-and-Trade Program, China’s Emission Trading Scheme and its nation-wide expansion, and South Korea’s Emission Trading Scheme. In the Netherlands, a CO\n2\nemissions tax was enacted on 1 January 2021. In Canada, Alberta’s Technology Innovation and Emission Reduction System went into effect 1 January 2020. In Ontario, Environment & Climate Change Canada’s Output Based Pricing System (“OBPS”) is currently in effect, however, effective 1 January 2022, Ontario’s GHG Emissions Performance Standards program will be used in lieu of adherence to the OBPS. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) requires mandatory reporting of GHG emissions and is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. Some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions, which often result in higher power costs.\nIncreased public concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG emissions. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact these measures will have on our operations. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions could negatively impact our growth, increase our operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of our products.\nRegulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for us. We continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency and lower emissions. We see significant opportunities for gasification, carbon capture technologies and hydrogen for mobility and energy transition.\nWe estimate that we spent approximately $8 million, $4 million, and $5 million in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, on capital projects reflected in continuing operations to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution are estimated to be approximately $8 million in both fiscal years 2022 and 2023.\nFor additional information regarding environmental matters, refer to Note 16,\nCommitments and Contingencies\n, to the consolidated financial statements.\nEmployees\nWe believe our employees are our most valuable asset and are critical to our success as an organization. Our goal is to be the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. Integral to our success is the continued development of our 4S culture (Safety, Speed, Simplicity and Self-Confidence) and creating a work environment where our employees feel that they belong and matter. Our talent related initiatives, including employee recruitment and development, diversity and inclusion and compensation and benefit programs, are focused on building and retaining the world-class and talented staff that is needed to meet our goals.\nOn 30 September 2021, we had approximately 20,875 employees, of whom approximately 20,625 were full-time and approximately 15,575 were located outside the United States. We have collective bargaining agreements with unions and works councils at certain locations that expire on various dates over the next four years. We consider relations with our employees to be good.\nOur 2021 Sustainability Report details our growth strategy and the role our most valuable asset and our competitive advantage, our employees, play in achieving our goals. Rooted in our framework of Grow- Conserve- Care, our higher purpose is to bring people together to collaborate and innovate solutions to the world’s most significant energy and environmental sustainability challenges. Our 2021 Sustainability Report details how we care for our employees.\n8\nSafety\nSafety is fundamental to who we are as a company. Safety is a shared value, and our employees’ commitment to safety is demonstrated in many ways every day. Safety is a critical component of everything we do, everywhere in the world. Our goal is to be the safest industrial gas company in the world.\nDiversity, Inclusion, and Belonging\nOur 2021 Sustainability Report sets forth our announced goals to further increase the percentage of women and U.S. minorities in professional and managerial roles and the recruitment and talent development strategies we have in place to ensure we meet these goals. Since the publication of our 2021 Sustainability Report, we have announced goals to further increase the percentage of women and U.S. minorities in professional and managerial roles. By 2025, we aim to achieve at least 28 percent female representation in the professional and managerial population globally. Due to significant increase of our U.S. minority representation, our new 2025 diversity goal is to achieve at least 30 percent U.S. minority representation in professional and managerial roles. We established these targets following analysis of our global employee representation metrics and future talent needs, as well as assessing industry benchmarks and peer companies.\nCompensation\nAs detailed in our 2021 Sustainability Report, in order to create a diverse workplace, individuals must be compensated fairly and equitably. A work environment where employees know they belong and matter includes fair and equitable pay. Our pay practices apply equally to all employees irrespective of gender, race, religion, disability, age, or any other form of personal difference. We strive to pay competitively in local markets where we do business and compete for talent. We benchmark our compensation to ensure that we are keeping pace with the market to provide competitive pay and benefits. A gender pay equity analysis completed by a third-party in 2020 resulted in no significant adverse findings for minorities in the U.S. and for females globally.\nWe value the contributions of our employees, particularly in the face of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of our employees are on the front line during the pandemic, keeping our plants running and delivering to our customers the products they need. When possible, employees have been working from home to help maintain their health and safety as well as business continuity. We have not laid off any of our employees or reduced their salaries due to COVID-19.\nSeasonality\nOur businesses are not subject to seasonal fluctuations to any material extent.\nInventories\nWe maintain limited inventory where required to facilitate the supply of products to customers on a reasonable delivery schedule. Inventory consists primarily of crude helium, industrial gas, and specialty gas inventories supplied to customers through liquid bulk and packaged gases supply modes.\nCustomers\nWe do not have a homogeneous customer base or end market, and no single customer accounts for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. We do have concentrations of customers in specific industries, primarily refining, chemicals, and electronics. Within each of these industries, we have several large-volume customers with long-term contracts. A negative trend affecting one of these industries, or the loss of one of these major customers, although not material to our consolidated revenue, could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nGovernmental Contracts\nOur business is not subject to a government entity’s renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts that would be material to our business as a whole.\nAvailable Information\nAll periodic and current reports, registration statements, proxy statements, and other filings that we are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\"), are available free of charge through our website at www.airproducts.com. Such documents are available as soon as reasonably practicable after electronic filing of the material with the SEC. All such reports filed during the period covered by this report were available on our website on the same day as filing. In addition, our filings with the SEC are available free of charge on the SEC's website, www.sec.gov.\n9\nOur Executive Officers\nOur executive officers and their respective positions and ages on 18 November 2021 follow. Information with respect to offices held is stated in fiscal years."

    "text": "Our operations are affected by various risks, many of which are beyond our control. In evaluating investment in the Company and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or presented elsewhere from time to time, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities. The risks described below are not all inclusive but are designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. In addition to such risks, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be significant, or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic, including resurgences and variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, and efforts to reduce its spread have led, and may continue to lead to, significant changes in levels of economic activity and significant disruption and volatility in global markets. These factors have led, and may continue to lead, to reduced demand for industrial gas products, particularly in our merchant business. In addition, COVID-19 may result in reduced sales in our other businesses, lower returns for certain of our projects, and the potential delay or cancellation of certain projects in our pipeline.\nIn addition, we are monitoring the health of our employees and many of our employees, including those based at our headquarters, are working remotely in accordance with health safety guidance and applicable governmental orders. Action by health or other governmental authorities requiring the closure of our facilities, recommending other physical distancing measures, or mandating vaccination against COVID-19 could negatively impact our business and those of our service providers and customers. Although we have business continuity and other safeguards in place, we cannot be certain that they will be fully effective for extended periods of time.\n10\nAs the pandemic and responses to it continue to evolve we may experience further adverse impacts on our operations, and our ability to access capital on favorable terms, or at all, may be impaired. In addition, we may face unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products when restrictions on business and travel end. If demand for our products exceeds our capacity, it could adversely affect our financial results and customer relationships. Although the duration and ultimate impact of these factors is unknown at this time, the decline in economic conditions due to COVID-19, or another disease-causing similar impacts, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and such impact may be material.\nFurther, to the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business, financial condition, and results of operations and global economic conditions more generally, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.\nChanges in global and regional economic conditions, the markets we serve, or the financial markets may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nUnfavorable conditions in the global economy or regional economies, the markets we serve or financial markets may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our revenues, operating results, and cash flows.\nDemand for our products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and markets in which we do business. Weak economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in the markets we serve have negatively impacted demand for our products and services in the past, including most recently due to COVID-19, and may do so in the future. Reduced demand for our products and services would have a negative impact on our revenues and earnings. In addition, reduced demand could depress sales, reduce our margins, constrain our operating flexibility or reduce efficient utilization of our manufacturing capacity, or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring. Excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities or those of our competitors could decrease our ability to maintain pricing and generate profits.\nIn addition, our operating results in one or more segments may be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions for particular customer markets within a segment. A decline in the industries served by our customers or adverse events or circumstances affecting individual customers can reduce demand for our products and services and impair the ability of such customers to satisfy their obligations to us, resulting in uncollected receivables, unanticipated contract terminations, project delays or the inability to recover plant investments, any of which may negatively impact our financial results.\nWeak overall demand or specific customer conditions may also cause customer shutdowns or defaults or otherwise make us unable to operate facilities profitably and may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or prevent projects from coming on-stream when expected. These or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific market, product, or customer events may require us to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, or intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on our financial results.\nOur extensive international operations can be adversely impacted by operational, economic, political, security, legal, and currency translation risks that could decrease profitability.\nIn fiscal year 2021, over 60% of our sales were derived from customers outside the United States and many of our operations, suppliers, and employees are located outside the United States. Our operations in foreign jurisdictions may be subject to risks including exchange control regulations, import and trade restrictions, trade policy and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing business abroad. Changing economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions, strained relations between countries, or the imposition of tariffs or international sanctions can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.\n11\nOur growth strategies depend in part on our ability to further penetrate markets outside the United States, particularly in markets such as China, India, Indonesia, and the Middle East, and involve significantly larger and more complex projects, including gasification and large-scale hydrogen projects, some in regions where there is the potential for significant economic and political disruptions. We are actively investing large amounts of capital and other resources, in some cases through joint ventures, in developing markets, which we believe to have high growth potential. Our operations in these markets may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies, including political and economic instability, project delay or abandonment due to unanticipated government actions, inadequate investment in infrastructure, undeveloped property rights and legal systems, unfamiliar regulatory environments, relationships with local partners, language and cultural differences and increased difficulty recruiting, training and retaining qualified employees. In addition, our properties and contracts in these locations may be subject to seizure and cancellation, respectively, without full compensation for loss. Successful operation of particular facilities or execution of projects may be disrupted by civil unrest, acts of war, sabotage or terrorism, and other local security concerns. Such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for security or require us to shut down operations for a period of time.\nFurthermore, because the majority of our revenue is generated from sales outside the United States, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period. Our policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates. We choose not to hedge the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ earnings into dollars. Accordingly, reported sales, net earnings, cash flows, and fair values have been, and in the future will be, affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. For a more detailed discussion of currency exposure, see Item 7A,\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n, below.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOperational and project execution risks, particularly with respect to our largest projects, may adversely affect our operations or financial results.\nA significant and growing portion of our business involves gasification and other large-scale projects that involve challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases that may last up to several years and involve the investment of billions of dollars. These projects are technically complex, often reliant on significant interaction with government authorities and face significant financing, development, operational and reputational risks. We may encounter difficulties in engineering, delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party, equipment and materials delivery delays, schedule changes, customer scope changes, delays related to obtaining regulatory permits and rights-of-way, inability to find adequate sources of labor in the locations where we are building new plants, weather-related delays, delays by customers' contractors in completing their portion of a project, technical or transportation difficulties, cost overruns, supply difficulties, geopolitical risks and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, that may impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule. In some cases, delays and additional costs may be substantial, and we may be required to cancel a project and/or compensate the customer for the delay. We may not be able to recover any of these costs. In addition, in some cases we seek financing for large projects and face market risk associated with the availability and terms of such financing. These financing arrangements may require that we comply with certain performance requirements which, if not met, could result in default and restructuring costs or other losses. All of these factors could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers, suppliers and other third parties, any of which could adversely affect our ability to secure new projects in the future.\nThe operation of our facilities, pipelines, and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as pipeline leaks and ruptures, fire, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures, vehicle accidents, or cyber incidents. If operational risks materialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, or loss of production, all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operations, reputation, financial results, and cash flows. In addition, our operating results are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and our ability to meet customer requirements, which depend, in part, on our ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets.\n12\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Regulations addressing, among other things, import/export restrictions, anti-bribery and corruption, and taxes, can negatively impact our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to government regulation in the United States and in the foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business. The application of laws and regulations to our business is sometimes unclear. Compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that could result in reduced profitability. If there is a determination that we have failed to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties or sanctions that could adversely impact our reputation and financial results. Compliance with changes in laws or regulations can result in increased operating costs and require additional, unplanned capital expenditures. Export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so. Changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of our businesses. Increasingly aggressive enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption requirements, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China Anti-Unfair Competition Law, could subject us to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation is deemed to have occurred. In addition, we are subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit us, or certain of our affiliates, from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the kind of business that we may conduct. Such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who are not subject to comparable restrictions or prevent us from taking advantage of growth opportunities.\nFurther, we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents, business partners or that businesses that we acquire would not violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering, and data privacy. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.\nWe may be unable to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, or effectively disentangle divested businesses.\nOur ability to grow revenue, earnings, and cash flow at anticipated rates depends in part on our ability to identify, successfully acquire and integrate businesses and assets at appropriate prices, and realize expected growth, synergies, and operating efficiencies. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired businesses or assets to meet expected returns, the failure to integrate acquired businesses, the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions, and the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses or assets for which we lack adequate contractual protections or insurance. In addition, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions that do not meet expectations.\nWe continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. These transactions pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements. For example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated time frame or at all. In addition, divestitures or other dispositions may dilute our earnings per share, have other adverse financial and accounting impacts, distract management, and give rise to disputes with buyers. In addition, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to indemnify buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities. Our financial results could be impacted adversely by claims under these indemnification provisions.\n13\nThe security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nWe depend on information technology to enable us to operate safely and efficiently and interface with our customers as well as to maintain our internal control environment and financial reporting accuracy and efficiency. Our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and service providers. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, property damage, or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information due to a security breach. In addition, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events, and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Security breaches of our systems (or the systems of our customers, suppliers or other business partners) could result in the misappropriation, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, and may subject us to legal liability.\nAs with most large systems, our information technology systems have in the past been, and in the future likely will be subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks, and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. To date, we are not aware of any significant impact on our operations or financial results from such attempts; however, unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations, result in the loss of assets, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could: interrupt our operations at one or more sites; delay production and shipments; result in the theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets; damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation; result in defective products or services, physical damage to facilities, pipelines or delivery systems, including those we own or operate for third parties, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws, or increased costs for security and remediation; or raise concerns regarding our internal control environment and internal control over financial reporting. Each of these consequences could adversely affect our business, reputation and our financial statements.\nOur business involves the use, storage, and transmission of information about our employees, vendors, and customers. The protection of such information, as well as our proprietary information, is critical to us. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. We have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information. We also, from time to time, export sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the United States. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, which could ultimately result in litigation and potential legal and financial liability. These events could also damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business.\nInterruption in ordinary sources of raw material or energy supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability.\nHydrocarbons, including natural gas, are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas. Energy, including electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel for delivery trucks, is the largest cost component of our business. Because our industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity, inflation and energy price fluctuations could materially impact our revenues and earnings. A disruption in the supply of energy, components, or raw materials, whether due to market conditions, legislative or regulatory actions, the COVID-19 pandemic, natural events, or other disruption, could prevent us from meeting our contractual commitments and harm our business and financial results.\nOur supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers. Lower natural gas production resulting from natural gas pricing dynamics, supplier operating or transportation issues, or other interruptions in sales from crude helium suppliers, can reduce our supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to customers.\n14\nWe typically contract to pass-through cost increases in energy and raw materials to customers, but such cost pass-through results in declining margins, and cost variability can negatively impact our other operating results. For example, we may be unable to raise prices as quickly as costs rise, or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery of such costs. In addition, increases in energy or raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons may negatively impact our revenues and earnings. Even where costs are passed through, price increases can cause lower sales volume.\nNew technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation.\nWe are continually developing and implementing new technologies and product offerings. Existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs or at scales beyond our experience base. These technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations. Failure of the technologies to work as predicted, or unintended consequences of new designs or uses, could lead to cost overruns, project delays, financial penalties, or damage to our reputation. In addition, gasification and other large-scale projects may contain processes or technologies that we have not operated at the same scale or in the same combination, and although such projects generally include technologies and processes that have been demonstrated previously by others, such technologies or processes may be new to us and may introduce new risks to our operations. Additionally, there is also a risk that our new technologies may become obsolete and replaced by other market alternatives. Performance difficulties on these larger projects may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. In addition, performance challenges may adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future contracts for gasification projects.\nProtecting our intellectual property is critical to our technological development and we may suffer competitive harm from infringement on such rights.\nAs we develop new technologies, it is critical that we protect our intellectual property assets against third-party infringement. We own a number of patents and other forms of intellectual property related to our products and services. As we develop new technologies there is a risk that our patent applications may not be granted, or we may not receive sufficient protection of our proprietary interests. We may also expend considerable resources in defending our patents against third-party infringement. It is critical that we protect our proprietary interests to prevent competitive harm.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nLegislative, regulatory, and societal responses to global climate change create financial risk.\nWe are the world’s leading supplier of hydrogen, the primary use of which is the production of ultra-low sulfur transportation fuels that have significantly reduced transportation emissions and helped improve human health. To make the high volumes of hydrogen needed by our customers, we use steam methane reforming, which produces carbon dioxide. In addition, gasification enables the conversion of lower value feedstocks into cleaner energy and value-added products; however, our gasification projects also produce carbon dioxide. Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing GHG emissions, including CO\n2\n, which may lead to direct and indirect costs on our operations. Furthermore, some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions, which often result in higher power costs.\nIncreased public concern and governmental action may result in more international, U.S. federal and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG emissions. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact these measures will have on our operations. Any legislation or governmental action that limits or taxes GHG emissions could negatively impact our growth, increase our operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of our products.\n15\nOur financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including antitrust, tax, environmental, or other matters.\nWe are subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. While we seek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangements, there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable. Also, the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from our expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to predict reliably. Various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables, where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows in any particular period.\nCosts and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact our operations and financial results.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air; discharges to land and water; and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of adverse environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and in the transportation of our products. Future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures. In addition, laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment, compliance, and remediation. These additional costs may adversely affect our financial results. For a more detailed description of these matters, see Item 1,\nBusiness–Environmental Regulation\n, above.\nA change of tax law in key jurisdictions could result in a material increase in our tax expense.\nThe multinational nature of our business subjects us to taxation in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.\nChanges to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Various levels of government, including the U.S. federal government, are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue. Further changes in tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nCatastrophic events could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our business, financial results, and cash flows.\nOur operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside our control, including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, epidemics, pandemics, acts of war, and terrorism. Any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute products and possibly expose us to third-party liability claims. Additionally, such events could impact our suppliers, customers, and partners, which could cause energy and raw materials to be unavailable to us, or our customers to be unable to purchase or accept our products and services. Any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results.\n16\nThe United Kingdom’s (“UK”) exit from European Union (“EU”) membership could adversely affect our European Operations.\nAlthough the UK’s exit from EU membership on 31 January 2021 (\"Brexit\") did not result in material disruptions to customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, or our European business, the ultimate effects of Brexit on us are still difficult to predict. Adverse consequences from Brexit may include greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and EU members and increased regulatory complexities. Any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, and our European business overall.\nInability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance.\nWe face strong competition from large global competitors and many smaller regional competitors in many of our business segments. Introduction by competitors of new technologies, competing products, or additional capacity could weaken demand for, or impact pricing of our products, negatively impacting financial results. In addition, competitors’ pricing policies could affect our profitability or market share."

    "text": "In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings, including commercial, competition, environmental, intellectual property, regulatory, product liability, and insurance matters. Although litigation with respect to these matters is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business, such litigation could result in large monetary awards, especially if compensatory and/or punitive damages are awarded. However, we believe that litigation currently pending to which we are a party will be resolved without any material adverse effect on our financial position, earnings, or cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we are also involved in proceedings, investigations, and audits involving governmental authorities in connection with environmental, health, safety, competition, and tax matters.\nWe are a party to proceedings under CERCLA, RCRA, and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Presently there are 31 sites on which a final settlement has not been reached where we, along with others, have been designated a potentially responsible party by the Environmental Protection Agency or is otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation, including cleanup activity at certain of its current and former manufacturing sites. We do not expect that any sums we may have to pay in connection with these environmental matters would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position. Additional information on our environmental exposure is included under Item 1, Business–Environmental Regulation, and Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn September 2010, the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense (\"CADE\") issued a decision against our Brazilian subsidiary, Air Products Brasil Ltda., and several other Brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities. CADE imposed a civil fine of R$179.2 million (approximately $33 million at 30 September 2021) on Air Products Brasil Ltda. This fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the Brazilian Ministry of Justice, following an investigation beginning in 2003, which alleged violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases. The fines are based on a percentage of our total revenue in Brazil in 2003.\n18\nWe have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in October 2010 with the Brazilian courts. On 6 May 2014, our appeal was granted and the fine against Air Products Brasil Ltda. was dismissed. CADE has appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending. We, with advice of our outside legal counsel, have assessed the status of this matter and have concluded that, although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is possible, such a judgment is not probable. As a result, no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements. In the event of an adverse final judgment, we estimate the maximum possible loss to be the full amount of the fine of R$179.2 million (approximately $33 million at 30 September 2021) plus interest accrued thereon until final disposition of the proceedings.\nAdditionally, Winter Storm Uri, a severe winter weather storm in the U.S. Gulf Coast in February 2021, disrupted our operations and caused power and natural gas prices to spike significantly in Texas. We are currently in the early stages of litigation of a dispute regarding energy management services related to the impact of this unusual event, and other disputes may arise from such power price increases. In addition, legislative action may affect power supply and energy management charges. While it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional costs related to power supply and energy management services in Texas related to the winter storm, it is too early to estimate potential losses, if any, given significant unknowns resulting from the unusual nature of this event.\nOther than the matters discussed above, we do not currently believe there are any legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, that are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded."

Focused on serving energy, environment and emerging markets, we provide essential industrial gases, related equipment, and applications expertise to customers in dozens of industries, including refining, chemicals, metals, electronics, manufacturing, and food and beverage. We are the world's largest supplier of hydrogen and have built leading positions in growth markets such as helium and liquefied natural gas (\"LNG\") process technology and equipment. We develop, engineer, build, own, and operate some of the world's largest industrial gas projects, including gasification projects that sustainably convert abundant natural resources into syngas for the production of high-value power, fuels, and chemicals and are developing carbon capture projects and world-scale low carbon and carbon-free hydrogen projects that will support global transportation and the energy transition away from fossil fuels.\n22\nWith operations in over 50 countries, in fiscal year 2021 we had sales of $10.3 billion and assets of $26.9 billion. Approximately 20,875 passionate, talented, and committed employees from diverse backgrounds are driven by our higher purpose to create innovative solutions that benefit the environment, enhance sustainability, and address the challenges facing customers, communities, and the world.\nAs of 30 September 2021, our operations were organized into five reportable business segments under which we managed our operations, assessed performance, and reported earnings:\n•\nIndustrial Gases – Americas;\n•\nIndustrial Gases – EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa);\n•\nIndustrial Gases – Asia;\n•\nIndustrial Gases – Global; and\n•\nCorporate and other\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis discusses our results based on these operations. Refer to Note 23,\nBusiness Segment and Geographic Information\n, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments.\nOn 4 November 2021, we announced the reorganization of our industrial gases segments effective 1 October 2021. Refer to Note 24,\nSubsequent Events\n, for additional information.\n2021 IN SUMMARY\nIn fiscal year 2021, we continued to execute our growth strategy, including announcement of several new gasification, carbon capture, and hydrogen projects that will drive the world’s energy transition from fossil fuels. At the same time, we remained focused on our base business, delivering consistent results despite external challenges globally and absorbing costs for additional resources needed to support growth. In the second half of the year, demand for most merchant products returned to pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, we continued to create shareholder value by increasing the quarterly dividend on our common stock to $1.50 per share, representing a 12% increase from the previous dividend. This is the 39\nth\nconsecutive year that we have increased our quarterly dividend payment.\nFiscal year 2021 results are summarized below:\n•\nSales of $10.3 billion increased 17%, or $1.5 billion, due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, higher volumes, favorable currency impacts, and positive pricing that more than offset power cost increases in the second half of the year.\n•\nOperating income of $2,281.4 increased 2%, or $43.8, and operating margin of 22.1% decreased 320 basis points (\"bp\").\n•\nNet income of $2,114.9 increased 10%, or $183.8, and net income margin of 20.5% decreased 130 bp.\n•\nAdjusted EBITDA of $3,883.2 increased 7%, or $263.4, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.6% decreased 330 bp.\n•\nDiluted EPS of $9.12 increased 7%, or $0.57 per share, and adjusted diluted EPS of $9.02 increased 8%, or $0.64 per share. A summary table of changes in diluted EPS is presented below.\n23\nChanges in Diluted EPS Attributable to Air Products\nThe per share impacts presented in the table below were calculated independently and may not sum to the total change in diluted EPS due to rounding.\n(A)\nDespite higher sales volumes, the volume impact on diluted EPS was flat due to reduced contributions from our 60%-owned joint venture with Lu'An Clean Energy Company that we consolidate within our Industrial Gases – Asia segment. Refer to the sales discussion below for additional detail. The volume impact from the Lu'An facility is partially offset by the positive impact of lower net income being attributed to our joint venture partner within \"Noncontrolling interests.\"\n24\n2022 OUTLOOK\nThe guidance below should be read in conjunction with the\nForward-Looking Statements\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe believe our achievements in 2021 are just the beginning of our journey providing gasification, carbon capture, and hydrogen for mobility solutions to address the world’s most significant energy and environmental sustainability challenges. For example, we expect our world-scale Jazan gasification project with Aramco, ACWA Power, and Air Products Qudra to begin contributing to our results in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. We expect to continue to pursue new, high-return opportunities that are aligned with our growth strategy and to add the resources necessary for project development and execution. We remain committed to creating shareholder value through capital deployment and delivering increased dividends, as we have done for the past 39 consecutive years.\nThe duration and extent of ongoing global challenges, such as rising energy costs, energy consumption curtailment, and supply chain disruptions, remain uncertain. For our merchant business, we plan to continue pricing actions to recover higher energy costs. We expect to add new projects to our onsite business model, which has contractual protection from energy cost fluctuations and generates stable cash flow. We expect higher costs from planned maintenance activities on our facilities in fiscal year 2022 and higher pension expense resulting from lower expected returns on assets.\nAdditionally, we expect the Lu’An facility to continue operating under the interim agreement discussed below through fiscal year 2022.\nIn fiscal year 2022, we will also continue to focus on our other sustainability goals, including our commitment to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions intensity and advance diversity and inclusion.\nOn 4 November 2021, we announced the reorganization of our industrial gases segments, including the separation of our Industrial Gases – EMEA segment into two separate reporting segments: Industrial Gases – Europe and Industrial Gases – Middle East. The results of an affiliate formerly reflected in the Industrial Gases – Asia segment will now be reported in the Industrial Gases – Middle East segment. Additionally, the results of our Industrial Gases – Global operating segment will be reflected in the Corporate and other segment. Beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, segment results will be presented on a retrospective basis to reflect the reorganization.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDiscussion of Consolidated Results\n25\nSales of $10,323.0 increased 17%, or $1,466.7, due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of 6%, higher volumes of 5%, favorable currency impacts of 4%, and positive pricing of 2%. We experienced significantly higher energy and natural gas costs in the second half of fiscal year 2021, particularly in North America and Europe. Contractual provisions associated with our on-site business, which represents approximately half our total company sales, allow us to pass these costs to our customers. Positive volumes from new assets, our sale of equipment businesses, and merchant demand recovery from COVID-19 were partially offset by reduced contributions from the Lu'An gasification project discussed below. Favorable currency was primarily driven by the appreciation of the British Pound Sterling, Chinese Renminbi, Euro, and South Korean Won against the U.S. Dollar. Continued focus on pricing actions, including energy cost recovery, in our merchant businesses resulted in price improvement in each of our three regional segments.\nLu’An Clean Energy Company (“Lu’An”), a long-term onsite customer in Asia with which we have a consolidated joint venture, restarted its facility in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 following successful completion of major maintenance work in September 2020. Our facility resumed operations, and the joint venture is supplying product at reduced charges as agreed upon with Lu'An under a short-term agreement reached in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. As a result of this agreement, we recognized lower revenue in our Industrial Gases – Asia segment in each quarter of fiscal year 2021. We expect this short-term reduction in charges to extend through fiscal year 2022.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nTotal cost of sales of $7,209.3, including the facility closure discussed below, increased 23%, or $1,351.2. The increase from the prior year was primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of $479, higher costs associated with sales volumes of $433, unfavorable currency impacts of $233, and higher costs, including power and other cost inflation, of $183. Gross margin of 30.2% decreased 370 bp from 33.9% in the prior year, primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, higher costs, and the reduced Lu'An contribution, partially offset by the positive impact of our pricing actions.\nFacility Closure\nIn the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we recorded a charge of $23.2 ($17.4 after-tax, or $0.08 per share) primarily for a noncash write-down of assets associated with a contract termination in the Industrial Gases – Americas segment. This charge is reflected as \"Facility closure\" on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021 and was not recorded in segment results.\nSelling and Administrative\nSelling and administrative expense of $828.4 increased 7%, or $52.5, primarily driven by higher spending for business development resources to support our growth strategy and unfavorable currency impacts. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 8.0% from 8.8% in the prior year.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense of $93.5 increased 11%, or $9.6, primarily due to higher product development costs in our Industrial Gases – Global segment\n.\nResearch and development expense as a percentage of sales of 0.9% was flat versus the prior year.\nGain on Exchange with Joint Venture Partner\nIn the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we recognized a gain of $36.8 ($27.3 after-tax, or $0.12 per share) on an exchange with the Tyczka Group, a former joint venture partner in our Industrial Gases – EMEA segment. As part of the exchange, we separated our 50/50 joint venture in Germany into two separate businesses so each party could acquire a portion of the business on a 100% basis. The gain included $12.7 from the revaluation of our previously held equity interest in the portion of the business that we retained and $24.1 from the sale of our equity interest in the remaining business. The gain is reflected as \"Gain on exchange with joint venture partner\" on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021 and was not recorded in segment results. Refer to Note 3,\nAcquisitions\n, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCompany Headquarters Relocation Income (Expense)\nIn anticipation of relocating our U.S. headquarters, we sold property at our corporate headquarters located in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. We received net proceeds of $44.1 and recorded a gain of $33.8 ($25.6 after-tax, or $0.12 per share), which is reflected on our consolidated income statements as \"Company headquarters relocation income (expense)\" for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020. The gain was not recorded in the results of the Corporate and other segment.\n26\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income of $52.8 decreased 19%, or $12.6. The prior year was favorably impacted by an adjustment for a benefit plan liability due to a change in plan terms. This impact was partially offset by the settlement of a supply contract in the current year.\nOperating Income and Margin\nOperating income of $2,281.4 increased 2%, or $43.8, as favorable currency of $96, positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $95, and a gain on an exchange with a joint venture partner of $37 were partially offset by higher operating costs of $127, prior year income associated with the company headquarters relocation of $34, and a facility closure of $23. Despite higher sales volumes, the volume impact on operating income was minimal due to reduced contributions from Lu'An. Unfavorable operating costs were driven by the addition of resources to support our growth strategy and higher planned maintenance activities.\nOperating margin of 22.1% decreased 320 bp from 25.3% in the prior year, primarily due to the higher operating costs, higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, which contributed to sales but not operating income, and reduced contributions from Lu'An, partially offset by positive pricing. The positive impact from a gain on an exchange with a joint venture partner in the current year was offset by prior year income associated with the company headquarters relocation.\nEquity Affiliates’ Income\nEquity affiliates' income of $294.1 increased 11%, or $29.3. Higher income from affiliates in the regional segments was partially offset by a prior year benefit of $33.8 from the enactment of the India Finance Act 2020. Refer to Note 21,\nIncome Taxes\n, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nWe expect our equity affiliates' income to grow in future periods due to our investment in the Jazan Integrated Gasification and Power Company joint venture.\nInterest Expense\nInterest incurred increased 36%, or $44.9, primarily driven by a higher debt balance due to the issuance of U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated fixed-rate notes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. Capitalized interest increased $12.4 due to a higher carrying value of projects under construction.\nOther Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net\nOther non-operating income of $73.7 increased $43.0. We recorded higher non-service pension income in 2021 due to lower interest costs and higher total assets, primarily for our U.S. pension plans. The current year also included favorable currency impacts. These factors were partially offset by lower interest income on cash and cash items due to lower interest rates.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $70.3 ($0.32 per share) for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021. This included net tax benefits of $60.0 recorded for the release of tax reserves for uncertain tax positions, of which $51.8 ($0.23 per share) was recorded in the fourth quarter for liabilities associated with the 2017 sale of our former Performance Materials Division (\"PMD\") and $8.2 was recorded in the third quarter for liabilities associated with our former Energy-from-Waste business. Additionally, we recorded a tax benefit from discontinued operations of $10.3 in the first quarter, primarily from the settlement of a state tax appeal related to the gain on the sale of PMD.\nIn fiscal year 2020, loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $14.3 ($0.06 per share). This resulted from a pre-tax loss of $19.0 recorded in the second quarter to increase our existing liability for retained environmental obligations associated with the sale of our former Amines business in September 2006. Refer to the Pace discussion within Note 16,\nCommitments and Contingencies\n, for additional information.\n27\nNet Income and Net Income Margin\nNet income of $2,114.9, including income from discontinued operations discussed above, increased 10%, or $183.8. On a continuing operations basis, the increase was primarily driven by positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, favorable currency impacts, higher equity affiliates' income, and a gain on an exchange with a joint venture partner, partially offset by unfavorable operating costs and a loss from a facility closure. In addition, less net income was attributable to noncontrolling interests, including our Lu'An joint venture partner, in the current year. The prior year included income associated with the company headquarters relocation and a net benefit from the India Finance Act 2020.\nNet income margin of 20.5% decreased 130 bp from 21.8% in the prior year,\nprimarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, which decreased margin by approximately 100 bp, and unfavorable net operating costs, partially offset by the impact from our pricing actions.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nAdjusted EBITDA of $3,883.2 increased 7%, or $263.4, primarily due to favorable currency impacts, positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, and higher equity affiliates' income, partially offset by unfavorable operating costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 37.6% decreased 330 bp from 40.9% in the prior year, primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, which decreased margin by approximately 200 bp, and the unfavorable net operating costs.\nEffective Tax Rate\nOur effective tax rate was 18.5% and 19.7% for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively. The current year rate was lower primarily due to income tax benefits of $21.5 recorded upon expiration of the statute of limitations for tax reserves previously established for uncertain tax positions taken in prior years. This included a benefit of $12.2 ($0.05 per share) for release of reserves established in 2017 for a tax election related to a non-U.S. subsidiary and other previously disclosed items (\"tax election benefit and other\"). Refer to Note 21\nIncome Taxes\n, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nAdditionally, the fiscal year 2020 effective tax rate reflected the unfavorable impact of India Finance Act 2020, which resulted in additional net income of $13.5 ($0.06 per share). This included an increase to equity affiliates' income of $33.8, partially offset by an increase to our income tax provision of $20.3 for changes in the future tax costs of repatriated earnings.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate was 18.9% and 19.1% for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSegment Analysis\nIndustrial Gases – Americas\n28\nSales of $4,167.6 increased 15%, or $536.9, due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of 11% and positive pricing of 4%, as volumes and currency were flat versus the prior year. Energy and natural gas cost pass through to customers was higher in fiscal year 2021 primarily due to natural gas prices, which rose significantly in the second quarter and remained elevated throughout the year. The pricing improvement was attributable to continued focus on pricing actions in our merchant business. Volumes were flat as positive contributions from new assets, including hydrogen assets we acquired in April 2020, were offset by lower hydrogen and merchant demand. Demand for most merchant products returned to pre-pandemic levels in the second half of 2021.\nOperating income of $1,065.5 increased 5%, or $53.1, due to higher pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $79 and favorable currency of $10, partially offset by higher operating costs, including planned maintenance, of $36. Operating margin of 25.6% decreased 230 bp from 27.9% in the prior year primarily due to higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, which negatively impacted margin by approximately 250 bp, and higher operating costs, partially offset by the impact of our pricing actions.\nEquity affiliates’ income of $112.5 increased 33%, or $28.2, primarily driven by higher income from affiliates in Mexico.\nIndustrial Gases – EMEA\nSales of $2,444.9 increased 27%, or $518.6, due to higher volumes of 12%, favorable currency impacts of 7%, higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers of 5%, and positive pricing of 3%. The volume improvement was primarily driven by our base merchant business and new assets, including those from a business in Israel that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2020. While our liquid bulk business has largely recovered from COVID-19, demand for packaged gases and hydrogen continues to be lower than pre-pandemic levels. Favorable currency impacts were primarily driven by the appreciation of the British Pound Sterling and Euro against the U.S. Dollar. Energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers was higher primarily in the second half of the year as we experienced significantly higher natural gas and electricity costs in Europe. The pricing improvement was primarily attributable to our merchant business.\nOperating income of $557.4 increased 18%, or $84.1, due to higher volumes of $59, favorable currency impacts of $31, and positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $11, partially offset by unfavorable costs of $17. Operating margin of 22.8% decreased 180 bp from 24.6% in the prior year, primarily due to impacts from higher energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers, which negatively impacted margin by approximately 100 bp, and unfavorable operating costs.\nEquity affiliates’ income of $93.7 increased 25%, or $18.9, primarily due to higher income from affiliates in Italy, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa.\n29\nIndustrial Gases – Asia\nSales of $2,920.8 increased 8%, or $204.3, due to favorable currency of 7% and positive pricing of 1%, as both volumes and energy and natural gas cost pass-through to customers were flat. Positive volume contributions from our base merchant business and new plants were offset by reduced contributions from Lu'An. The favorable currency impact was primarily attributable to the appreciation of the Chinese Renminbi and South Korean Won against the U.S. Dollar.\nOperating income of $838.3 decreased 4%, or $32.0, primarily due to unfavorable volume mix of $62 and higher operating costs, including inflation and product sourcing costs, of $32, partially offset by favorable currency of $59.\nOperating margin of 28.7% decreased 330 bp from 32.0% in the prior year primarily due to reduced contributions from Lu'An.\nEquity affiliates’ income of $81.4 increased 33%, or $20.4, primarily due to higher income from an affiliate in India.\nIndustrial Gases – Global\nThe Industrial Gases – Global segment includes sales of cryogenic and gas processing equipment for air separation and centralized global costs associated with management of all the Industrial Gases segments.\nSales of $511.0 increased 40%, or $146.1, due to higher sale of equipment project activity. Despite higher sales, operating loss of $60.6 increased 52%, or $20.6, as higher project costs\nand product development spending were partially offset by income from the settlement of a supply contract.\n30\nCorporate and other\nThe Corporate and other segment includes our LNG, turbo machinery equipment and services, and distribution sale of equipment businesses as well as corporate support functions that benefit all segments. The results of the Corporate and other segment also include income and expense that is not directly associated with the other segments, such as foreign exchange gains and losses.\nSales of $278.7 increased 28%, or $60.8, primarily due to higher project activity in our distribution sale of equipment and turbo machinery equipment and services businesses. Despite higher sales, operating loss of $132.8 increased 18%, or $20.6, as higher business development and corporate support costs were only partially offset by higher sale of equipment activity.\nRECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(Millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated, except for per share data)\nWe present certain financial measures, other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), on an \"adjusted\" or \"non-GAAP\" basis. On a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\"), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate, and capital expenditures. On a segment basis, these measures include adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. In addition to these measures, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to help the reader understand the impact that certain disclosed items, or \"non-GAAP adjustments,\" have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted EPS. For each non-GAAP financial measure, we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others with useful information to evaluate the performance of our business because such measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results.\nIn many cases, non-GAAP financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP measure to exclude non-GAAP adjustments that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance. For example, we previously excluded certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions, impairment charges, and gains on disclosed transactions. The reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future. Readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP financial measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.\nWhen applicable, the tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments. These tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.\n31\nAdjusted Diluted EPS\nThe table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which we view as a key performance metric. In periods that we have non-GAAP adjustments, we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of each such adjustment because management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance. The per share impact for each non-GAAP adjustment was calculated independently and may not sum to total adjusted diluted EPS due to rounding.\n32\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income less income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, and excluding non-GAAP adjustments, which we do not believe to be indicative of underlying business trends, before interest expense, other non-operating income (expense), net, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful metrics for management to assess operating performance. Margins are calculated independently for each period by dividing each line item by consolidated sales for the respective period and may not sum to total margin due to rounding.\nThe tables below present consolidated sales and a reconciliation of net income on a GAAP basis to adjusted EBITDA and net income margin on a GAAP basis to adjusted EBITDA margin:\n33\nThe tables below present sales and a reconciliation of operating income and operating margin to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin for each of our reporting segments for the fiscal years ended 30 September:\n(A)\nRefer to the\nReconciliations to Consolidated Results\nsection below.\n34\nReconciliations to Consolidated Results\nThe table below reconciles consolidated operating income as reflected on our consolidated income statements to total operating income in the table above for the fiscal years ended 30 September:\nThe table below reconciles consolidated equity affiliates' income as reflected on our consolidated income statements to total equity affiliates' income in the table above for the fiscal years ended 30 September:\nAdjusted Effective Tax Rate\nThe effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes.\nWhen applicable, the tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments. These tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.\n35\nCapital Expenditures\nWe define capital expenditures as cash flows for additions to plant and equipment, acquisitions (less cash acquired), and investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates. A reconciliation of cash used for investing activities to our reported capital expenditures is provided below:\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur cash balance and cash flows from operations are our primary sources of liquidity and are generally sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. In addition, we have the flexibility to access capital through a variety of financing activities, including accessing the capital markets, drawing upon our credit facility, or alternatively, accessing the commercial paper markets. At this time, we have not utilized, nor do we expect to access, our credit facility for additional liquidity. In addition, we have considered the impacts of COVID-19 on our liquidity and capital resources and do not expect it to impact our ability to meet future liquidity needs.\nAs of 30 September 2021, we had $1,590.4 of foreign cash and cash items compared to total cash and cash items of $4,468.9. We do not expect that a significant portion of the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates will be subject to U.S. income tax upon repatriation to the U.S. Depending on the country in which the subsidiaries and affiliates reside, the repatriation of these earnings may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes. However, since we have significant current investment plans outside the U.S., it is our intent to permanently reinvest the majority of our foreign cash and cash items that would be subject to additional taxes outside the U.S.\nCash Flows From Operations\nFor the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $3,335.2. Other adjustments of $116.7 included pension plan contributions of $44.6 and pension income of $38.9 that did not have a cash impact. The working capital accounts were a source of cash of $16.7, primarily driven by a $187.9 source of cash from payables and accrued liabilities, partially offset by a $130.5 use of cash from trade receivables, less allowances. The source of cash within payables and accrued liabilities primarily resulted from higher natural gas costs, which also drove the use of cash within trade receivables as we contractually passed through these higher costs to customers.\n36\nFor the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $3,264.7. We recorded a net benefit of $13.5 on our consolidated income statements related to a recently enacted tax law in India during the second quarter. This net benefit, which is further discussed in Note 21,\nIncome Taxes\n, to the consolidated financial statements, increased \"Undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\" by $33.8 and increased \"Deferred income taxes\" by $20.3. The \"Gain on sale of assets and investments\" of $45.8 includes a gain of $33.8 related to the sale of property at our current corporate headquarters. Refer to Note 22,\nSupplemental Information\n, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The working capital accounts were a use of cash of $40.1, primarily driven by other working capital uses of $130.6, partially offset by a source of $84.4 from other receivables. The use of cash within \"Other working capital\" was primarily due to timing of tax payments and a tax benefit as a result of the assets acquired in April 2020 from PBF Energy Inc. The source of cash within \"Other receivables\" was primarily driven by maturities of forward exchange contracts.\nCash Flows From Investing Activities\nFor the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021, cash used for investing activities was $2,732.9. Capital expenditures for plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, were $2,464.2. Purchases of investments with terms greater than three months but less than one year of $2,100.7 exceeded proceeds from investments of $1,875.2, which resulted from maturities of time deposits and treasury securities.\nFor the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020, cash used for investing activities was $3,560.0. Payments for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, were $2,509.0. This includes the acquisition of five operating hydrogen production plants from PBF Energy Inc. in Delaware and California for approximately $580. Additionally, acquisitions, less cash acquired, includes $183.3 for three businesses we acquired on 1 July 2020, the largest of which was a business in Israel that primarily offers merchant gas products. Refer to Note 3,\nAcquisitions\n, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Purchases of investments of $2,865.5 related to time deposits and treasury securities with terms greater than three months and less than one year and exceeded proceeds from investments of $1,938.0. Proceeds from sale of assets and investments of $80.3 included net proceeds of $44.1 related to the sale of property at our current corporate headquarters.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as cash flows for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, acquisitions (less cash acquired), and investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates. The components of our capital expenditures are detailed in the table below. We present a reconciliation of our capital expenditures to cash used for investing activities on page 36.\nCapital expenditures in fiscal year 2021 totaled $2,550.7 compared to $2,716.7 in fiscal year 2020. The decrease of $166.0 was primarily driven by the prior year acquisition of five operating hydrogen production plants from PBF, partially offset by lower spending for acquisitions. Additions to plant and equipment also included support capital of a routine, ongoing nature, including expenditures for distribution equipment and facility improvements.\n37\nOutlook for Investing Activities\nWe expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2022 to be approximately $4.5 to $5 billion. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we paid $1.6 billion, including approximately $130 from a non-controlling partner in one of our subsidiaries, for the initial investment in the Jazan gasification and power project. We expect to make an additional investment of approximately $1 billion, which includes contribution from our non-controlling partner, for phase II of the project in 2023. Refer to Note 24,\nSubsequent Events\n, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nIt is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to reconcile our forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities because we are unable to identify the timing or occurrence of our future investment activity, which is driven by our assessment of competing opportunities at the time we enter into transactions. These decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a significant effect on our cash used for investing activities.\nWe anticipate capital expenditures to be funded principally with our current cash balance and cash generated from continuing operations. In addition, we intend to continue to evaluate (1) acquisitions of small- and medium-sized industrial gas companies or assets from other industrial gas companies; (2) purchases of existing industrial gas facilities from our customers to create long-term contracts under which we own and operate the plant and sell industrial gases to the customer based on a fixed fee; and (3) investment in large industrial gas projects driven by demand for more energy, cleaner energy, and emerging market growth.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nIn fiscal year 2021, cash used for financing activities was $1,420.9 and primarily included dividend payments to shareholders of $1,256.7 and payments on long-term debt of $462.9, partially offset by long-term debt proceeds of $178.9 and investments by noncontrolling interests of $136.6. The payments on long-term debt included the repayment of a €350.0 million Eurobond ($428) in June 2021.\nIn November 2021, we repaid our 3.0% Senior Note of $400, plus interest, on its maturity date.\nIn fiscal year 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $3,284.7 as we successfully accessed the debt markets in April 2020 to support opportunities for growth projects and repay upcoming debt maturities. Long-term debt proceeds of $4,895.8 were partially offset by dividend payments to shareholders of $1,103.6 and payments on long-term debt of $406.6 primarily related to the repayment of a 2.0% Eurobond of €300.0 million ($353.9) that matured on 7 August 2020. Other financing activities were a use of cash of $97.2 and included financing charges associated with the third quarter debt issuance.\nFinancing and Capital Structure\nCapital needs in fiscal year 2021 were satisfied with cash from operations. Total debt decreased from $7,907.8 as of 30 September 2020 to $7,637.2 as of 30 September 2021, primarily due to repayment of the €350 million Eurobond, partially offset by proceeds from long-term borrowings on our foreign commitments. Total debt includes related party debt of $358.4 and $338.5 as of 30 September 2021 and 30 September 2020, respectively, primarily associated with the Lu'An joint venture. For additional detail, refer to Note 14,\nDebt\n, to the consolidated financial statements.\n38\nOn 31 March 2021, we entered into a five-year $2,500 revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the “2021 Credit Agreement”), under which senior unsecured debt is available to us and certain of our subsidiaries. The 2021 Credit Agreement provides a source of liquidity and supports our commercial paper program. The only financial covenant in the 2021 Credit Agreement is a maximum ratio of total debt to capitalization (equal to total debt plus total equity) not to exceed 70%. Total debt as of 30 September 2021 and 30 September 2020, expressed as a percentage of total capitalization, was 35.2% and 38.9%, respectively. No borrowings were outstanding under the 2021 Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2021.\nThe 2021 Credit Agreement replaced our previous five-year $2,300.0 revolving credit agreement, which was to have matured on 31 March 2022. No borrowings were outstanding under the previous agreement as of 30 September 2020 or at the time of its termination. No early termination penalties were incurred.\nCommitments of $296.7 are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries, $176.2 of which was borrowed and outstanding as of 30 September 2021.\nAs of 30 September 2021, we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements.\nOn 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,000 of our outstanding common stock. We did not purchase any of our outstanding shares in fiscal years 2021 or 2020. As of 30 September 2021, $485.3 in share repurchase authorization remains.\nDividends\nCash dividends on our common stock are paid quarterly, usually during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. We expect to continue to pay cash dividends in the future at comparable or increased levels.\nThe Board of Directors determines whether to declare dividends and the timing and amount based on financial condition and other factors it deems relevant. In 2021, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend on our common stock to $1.50 per share, representing a 12% increase from the previous dividend of $1.34 per share. This is the 39\nth\nconsecutive year that we have increased our quarterly dividend payment.\nOn 18 November 2021, the Board of Directors declared the first quarter 2022 dividend of $1.50 per share. The dividend is payable on 14 February 2022 to shareholders of record as of 3 January 2022.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn fiscal year 2021, cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations of $6.7 resulted from cash received as part of a state tax settlement related to the sale of PMD in fiscal year 2017.\nPENSION BENEFITS\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans are the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. These plans were closed to new participants in 2005, after which defined contribution plans were offered to new employees. The shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions.\nThe fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans as of the 30 September 2021 measurement date increased to $5,248.7 from $4,775.1 at the end of fiscal year 2020. The projected benefit obligation for these plans was $5,304.9 and $5,373.5 at the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The net unfunded liability decreased $542.2 from $598.4 to $56.2, primarily due to favorable asset experience. Refer to Note 15,\nRetirement Benefits\n, to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on our postretirement benefits.\n39\nPension Expense\nWe recognized pension income of $37.3 in fiscal year 2021 versus expense of $7.0 in fiscal year 2020, primarily due to lower interest cost and higher total assets. Special items decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower pension settlement losses.\n2022 Outlook\nIn fiscal year 2022, we expect pension impacts to range from $5 million of income to $5 million of expense, which includes potential settlement losses of $5 to $10 million, depending on the timing of retirements. This forecast reflects a lower expected estimated return on assets due to the increased percentage of fixed income investments within the plan asset portfolios and higher interest cost, partially offset by lower forecasted actuarial loss amortization. In fiscal year 2022, our expected range of pension impacts includes approximately $80 for amortization of actuarial losses.\nIn fiscal year 2021, pension expense included amortization of actuarial losses of $97.8. Net actuarial gains of $360.8 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in fiscal year 2021. Actuarial gains and losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets could impact the actuarial gain or loss and resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2022.\nPension Funding\nPension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses.\nIn addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. With the assistance of third-party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During 2021 and 2020, our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $44.6 and $37.5, respectively.\nFor fiscal year 2022, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $40 to $50. The estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon the timing of retirements. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors. We do not expect COVID-19 to impact our contribution forecast for fiscal year 2022.\n40\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nRefer to Note 1,\nMajor Accounting Policies\n, and Note 2,\nNew Accounting Guidance\n, to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our major accounting policies and information concerning implementation and impact of new accounting guidance.\nThe accounting policies discussed below are those policies that we consider to be the most critical to understanding our financial statements because they require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current and/or future economic and market conditions and their effect based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements. If conditions change, actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors.\nDepreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment\nPlant and equipment, net at 30 September 2021 totaled $13,254.6, and depreciation expense totaled $1,284.1 during fiscal year 2021. Plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life.\nEconomic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location.\nThe estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially when business circumstances change. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, excessive wear and tear, or unanticipated government actions may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis.\nThe regional Industrial Gases segments have numerous long-term customer supply contracts for which we construct an on-site plant adjacent to or near the customer’s facility. These contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term supply contracts are generally matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the associated production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset.\nOur regional Industrial Gases segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and, for smaller customers, packaged gases. The depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are generally 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, competitors’ actions, etc.\nIn addition, we may purchase assets through transactions accounted for as either an asset acquisition or a business combination. Depreciable lives are assigned to acquired assets based on the age and condition of the assets, the remaining duration of long-term supply contracts served by the assets, and our historical experience with similar assets. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change.\n41\nImpairment of Assets\nAs discussed below, there were no triggering events in fiscal year 2021 that would require impairment testing for any of our asset groups, reporting units that contain goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles assets, or equity method investments. We completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded there were no indications of impairment.\nImpairment of Assets – Plant and Equipment\nPlant and equipment meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Plant and equipment to be disposed of other than by sale may be reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, such as unexpected contract terminations or unexpected foreign government-imposed restrictions or expropriations. Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances would include: (1) a significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping; (2) a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition; (3) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the long-lived asset; (4) a reduction in revenues that is other than temporary; (5) a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping; or (6) changes in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets.\nIf such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows.\nThe assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment. Factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, inflation, etc. The assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review and could include probability weighting of cash flow projections associated with multiple potential future scenarios. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges.\nIn fiscal year 2021, there was no need to test for impairment on any of our asset groupings as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of our asset groupings may not be recoverable.\nImpairment of Assets – Goodwill\nThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price (plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree) over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill was $911.5 as of 30 September 2021. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 9,\nGoodwill\n, to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable. The tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly. We have five reportable business segments, seven operating segments and ten reporting units, seven of which include a goodwill balance. Refer to Note 23,\nBusiness Segment and Geographic Information\n, for additional information. Reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each reportable segment. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within our regional Industrial Gases segments.\nAs part of the goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. However, we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and conduct quantitative testing to determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n42\nTo determine the fair value of a reporting unit, we initially use an income approach valuation model, representing the present value of estimated future cash flows. Our valuation model uses a discrete growth period and an estimated exit trading multiple. The income approach is an appropriate valuation method due to our capital-intensive nature, the long-term contractual nature of our business, and the relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units. The principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rates, operating profit and/or adjusted EBITDA margins, discount rate, and exit multiple. Projected revenue growth rates and operating profit and/or adjusted EBITDA assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and/or revised forecasts and long-term financial planning process. The discount rate assumption is calculated based on an estimated market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, which includes factors such as the risk-free rate of return, cost of debt, and expected equity premiums. The exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions and where appropriate, reflects expected long-term growth rates.\nIf our initial review under the income approach indicates there may be impairment, we incorporate results under the market approach to further evaluate the existence of impairment. When the market approach is utilized, fair value is estimated based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies and/or regional manufacturing companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business as the reporting unit, adjusted to reflect differences in size and growth prospects. When both the income and market approach are utilized, we review relevant facts and circumstances and make a qualitative assessment to determine the proper weighting. Management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model, and actual results could differ from the estimates.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test, noting no indications of impairment. The fair value of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value.\nDue to the reorganization of our business effective as of 1 October 2021, we conducted an additional impairment test on our existing reporting units as of 30 September 2021. The fair value of all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value at 30 September 2021.\nFuture events that could have a negative impact on the level of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to: long-term economic weakness, decline in market share, pricing pressures, inability to successfully implement cost improvement measures, increases to our cost of capital, changes in the strategy of the reporting unit, and changes to the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses. Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in impairment charges.\nImpairment of Assets – Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets, net with determinable lives at 30 September 2021 totaled $380.4 and consisted primarily of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and land use rights. These intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. See the impairment discussion above under \"\nImpairment of Assets – Plant and Equipment\n\" for a description of how impairment losses are determined.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets at 30 September 2021 totaled $40.3 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. To determine fair value, we utilize the royalty savings method, a form of the income approach. This method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties avoided through ownership of the asset.\nDisclosures related to intangible assets other than goodwill are included in Note 10,\nIntangible Assets\n, to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangibles which resulted in no impairment.\n43\nImpairment of Assets – Equity Method Investments\nInvestments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled $1,649.3 at 30 September 2021. The majority of our investments are non-publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business. Summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in Note 7,\nSummarized Financial Information of Equity Affiliates\n, to the consolidated financial statements. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.\nAn impairment loss is recognized in the event that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below the carrying value of an investment occurs. Management’s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on the income approach and/or market approach. We utilize estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee under the income approach. For the market approach, we utilize market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gases companies. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge.\nIn fiscal year 2021, there was no need to test any of our equity affiliate investments for impairment, as no events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable.\nRevenue Recognition – Cost Incurred Input Method\nRevenue from equipment sale contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use. We use a cost incurred input method to recognize revenue by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer.\nAccounting for contracts using the cost incurred input method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimates of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance, schedule delays, technical issues, labor productivity, the complexity of work performed, the cost and availability of materials, and performance of subcontractors. When adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs are required, any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such change. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\nIn addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of project procurement and construction activities, our sale of equipment projects within our Industrial Gases – Global segment require monitoring of risks associated with schedule, geography, and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract.\nChanges in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method unfavorably impacted operating income by approximately $19 in fiscal year 2021 as compared to a favorable impact of $7 in fiscal year 2020. Our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years.\nWe assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress. Our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our forecast of revenues and costs on these projects.\nRevenue Recognition –\nOn-site Customer Contracts\nFor customers who require large volumes of gases on a long-term basis, we produce and supply gases under long-term contracts from large facilities that we build, own and operate on or near the customer’s facilities. Certain of these on-site contracts contain complex terms and provisions such as tolling arrangements, minimum payment requirements, variable components and pricing provisions that require significant judgment to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition.\n44\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. As of 30 September 2021, accrued income taxes, including the amount recorded as noncurrent, was $251.0, and net deferred tax liabilities were $1,080.7. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2021 were $140.3, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax expense for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021 was $462.8. Disclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 21,\nIncome Taxes\n, to the consolidated financial statements.\nManagement judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets.\nActual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments.\nDeferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense.\nA 1% increase or decrease in our effective tax rate may result in a decrease or increase to net income, respectively, of approximately $25.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nThe amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions, expense, and obligations associated with the defined benefit plans.\nActuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern.\nSeveral assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 15,\nRetirement Benefits\n, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the U.S. and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. Mortality rates are based on the most recent U.S. and international mortality tables. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and differences in rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover.\nOne of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. We measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows. The rates along the yield curve are used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. These rates change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the discount rate may result in a decrease or increase to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $20 per year.\n45\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the long-term average rate of return to be earned by plan assets reflecting current asset allocations. In determining estimated asset class returns, we take into account historical and future expected long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets may result in a decrease or increase to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $23 per year.\nWe use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets. This is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses on equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur and reduces year-to-year volatility. The market-related value for non-equity investments equals the actual fair value. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets.\nThe expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the expected rate of compensation may result in an increase or decrease to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $7 per year.\nLoss Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, we encounter contingencies, or situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on our company. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.\nContingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1,\nMajor Accounting Policies\n, to the consolidated financial statements, and details are provided in Note 16,\nCommitments and Contingencies\n, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions to the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, a different remediation alternative is identified, or our proportionate share of the liability increases. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded."

    "text": "Our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital.\nWe address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and related major accounting policies, refer to Note 1,\nMajor Accounting Policies\n, and Note 12,\nFinancial Instruments\n, to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass-through contracts with customers and price increases.\nOur derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt, including the current portion and amounts owed to related parties; interest rate swaps; cross currency interest rate swaps; and foreign exchange-forward contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the \"net financial instrument position\" and is disclosed in Note 13,\nFair Value Measurements\n, to the consolidated financial statements.\n46\nOur net financial instrument position decreased from a liability of $8,220.7 at 30 September 2020 to a liability of $7,850.3 at 30 September 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the repayment of a €350.0 million Eurobond ($428) on its maturity date in June 2021.\nThe analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. Market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions as of the valuation date, such as interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatilities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur debt portfolio as of 30 September 2021 and 2020, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements, was composed of 89% fixed-rate debt and 11% variable-rate debt.\nThe sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp parallel move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2021, with all other variables held constant. A 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $587 and $711 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively. A 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of $692 and $846 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nBased on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional $8 of interest incurred per year at 30 September 2021 and 2020. A 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by $8 per year at 30 September 2021 and 2020.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nThe sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2021 and 2020, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $343 and $360 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are the Euro and U.S. Dollar and Chinese Renminbi and U.S. Dollar. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Thus, there is either an asset or liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis.\nThe majority of our sales are denominated in foreign currencies as they are derived outside the United States. Therefore, financial results will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Chinese Renminbi and the Euro represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings. We estimate that a 10% reduction in either the Chinese Renminbi or the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately $45 and $25, respectively.\n47"

Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n50\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRevenue Recognition – On-site Customer Contracts – Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nOn-site industrial gas customer contracts involve large capital investments to serve customers who require large volumes of gases and have relatively constant demand. The Company builds, owns and operates facilities on or near the customer’s facilities to produce and supply the customer with gases under a long-term arrangement. Typically, these contracts have 15- to 20-year terms and contain fixed monthly charges and/or minimum purchase requirements. Revenue associated with these contracts is generally recognized over time during the period in which the Company delivers or makes available the agreed upon quantity of gases. In addition, certain on-site industrial gas contracts contain complex terms and provisions such as tolling arrangements, minimum payment requirements, pricing provisions, and variable components that are specific to a customer arrangement, including certain contracts with related parties. These arrangements may require greater judgment in determining when contractual requirements have been met, impacting the timing and amount of revenue to be recorded.\nWe identified revenue recognition for certain on-site industrial gas customer contracts with complex terms and provisions as a critical audit matter because of the judgments necessary for management to evaluate these contract terms, including amendments, when determining the amount of revenue to be recognized. This required a high degree of auditor judgment when performing procedures to audit management’s identification and assessment of contract terms when determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition and evaluating the results of those procedures.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to revenue recognition for certain on-site industrial gas customer contracts with complex terms and provisions included the following procedures, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of the Company’s controls related to the amount and timing of revenue recognition, including controls over the evaluation of complex terms and provisions in certain on-site industrial gas customer contracts.\n•\nWe evaluated the terms included within original customer contracts and related amendments to assess the accounting for provisions such as minimum payment requirements, pricing provisions, settlement terms, and variable components that require management to apply judgment in determining revenue recognition associated with the contract.\n•\nWe tested the probability of collection of variable components, including penalties, which impacts the amount and timing of revenue which the Company expects to collect.\n•\nWe inquired of personnel who oversee operations, customer relations, and revenue recognition as to the presence of contract amendments, and interpretation of contract terms.\n•\nWe considered the nature of transactions with related parties and any potential impact on revenue recognition.\n•\nWe evaluated customer transactions and agreed the amount of revenue recognized to underlying contracts, customer invoices, and cash receipts.\n•\nWe considered customer payment history, subsequent events, write-offs of customer receivables, collectability, modification of contract terms, and other factors that could impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition.\n51\nRevenue Recognition – Cost Incurred Input Method – Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company enters into sale of equipment contracts with customers for which the promised goods or services contained within the contracts are integrated with or dependent upon other goods or services for a single output to the customer. Revenue from the sale of equipment contracts is generally recognized over time as the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance, as completed, and performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with an alternative use. The Company uses a cost incurred input method to recognize revenue by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations.\nAccounting for contracts using the cost incurred input method requires a high degree of judgment to estimate total costs used to recognize revenue. Changes in estimated costs could have a significant impact on the timing of revenue recognition. Auditing these estimates requires extensive audit effort due to the complexity around the cost estimation process which involves multiple inputs and variables for sale of equipment contracts and a high degree of auditor judgment when evaluating the results of those procedures.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to complex contracts with customers for sales of equipment included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of the Company’s controls related to the amount and timing of revenue recognition for sale of equipment contracts, including controls over developing the estimated costs at completion and the evaluation of changes in estimated total costs for sale of equipment contracts.\n•\nWe evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of the methods and assumptions used by management to evaluate estimated total costs and changes in estimated costs to determine if the estimated total costs at completion for sale of equipment contracts were reasonable.\n•\nWith the assistance of our professionals having expertise in accounting for sale of equipment contracts, we performed the following:\n◦\nEvaluated management’s ability to estimate total costs at completion for each selected contract by performing corroborating inquiries with the Company’s project managers and personnel involved with the selected contracts, including inquiries related to the timeline for completion and estimates of future costs to complete the contract.\n◦\nSelected a sample of estimates of future costs to complete and evaluated management’s estimates of total costs at completion by performing one of the following:\n▪\nComparing management’s estimates to documents such as work plans, customer purchase orders, third-party supplier invoices, and subcontractor agreements, or\n▪\nDeveloping independent estimates of total costs to completion and comparing our estimates to management’s estimates. Our independent estimates were based on information such as work plans, customer purchase orders, third-party supplier invoices, subcontractor agreements, and similar historical project experience.\n◦\nWe compared the gross margin on sale of equipment contracts to that of historical periods in order to evaluate the Company's ability to accurately estimate costs at completion.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nNovember 18, 2021\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2018.\n52\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS\n(Millions of dollars, except for share and per share data)\n*\nEarnings per share (\"EPS\") is calculated independently for each component and may not sum to total EPS due to rounding.\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\n53\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED COMPREHENSIVE INCOME STATEMENTS\n(Millions of dollars)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\n54\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Millions of dollars, except for share and per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\n55\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(Millions of dollars)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\n56\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EQUITY\n(Millions of dollars, except for per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\n57\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Millions of dollars unless otherwise indicated, except for share and per share data)\n58\n1.\nMAJOR ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation Principles\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and those of its controlled subsidiaries (“we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company,” “Air Products,” or “registrant”), which are generally majority owned. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nWe consolidate all entities that we control. The general condition for control is ownership of a majority of the voting interests of an entity. Control may also exist in arrangements where we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (\"VIE\"). An entity that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of a VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits significant to the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary of that entity. We have determined that we are not a primary beneficiary of any material VIE.\nThe notes to the consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise indicated, are on a continuing operations basis. The results of operations and cash flows for our discontinued operations have been segregated from the results of continuing operations and segment results. The comprehensive income related to discontinued operations has not been segregated and is included in the consolidated comprehensive income statements. There were\nno\nassets and liabilities presented as discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 5,\nDiscontinued Operations\n, for additional information.\nCertain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal year 2021 presentation.\nEstimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCOVID-19 Risks and Uncertainties\nCOVID-19, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, continues to impact our business operations and results. There continue to be many unknowns regarding the pandemic, including the ongoing spread and severity of the virus and the pace of vaccine rollouts globally. Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, uncertainty remains related to how the pandemic may affect our business, results of operations, and overall financial performance.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied, which occurs when control is transferred to the customer.\nWe determine the transaction price of our contracts based on the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services provided. Our contracts within the scope of revenue guidance do not contain payment terms that include a significant financing component.\nSales returns and allowances are not a business practice in the industry.\nOur sale of gas contracts are either accounted for over time during the period in which we deliver or make available the agreed upon quantity of goods or at a point in time when the customer receives and obtains control of the product, which generally occurs upon delivery. We generally recognize revenue from our sale of gas contracts based on the right to invoice practical expedient.\nOur sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation as the individual promised goods or services contained within the contracts are integrated with or dependent upon other goods or services in the contract for a single output to the customer. Revenue from our sale of equipment contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use. We recognize these contracts using a cost incurred input method by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations.\n59\nAmounts billed for shipping and handling fees are classified as sales in the consolidated income statements. Shipping and handling activities for our sale of equipment contracts may be performed after the customer obtains control of the promised goods. In these cases, we have elected to apply the practical expedient to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods. For our sale of gas contracts, control generally transfers to the customer upon delivery.\nAmounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from sales in the consolidated income statements.\nFor additional information, refer to Note 4,\nRevenue Recognition\n.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales predominantly represents the cost of tangible products sold. These costs include labor, raw materials, plant engineering, power, depreciation, production supplies and materials packaging costs, and maintenance costs. Costs incurred for shipping and handling are also included in cost of sales.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is recorded using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its expected economic useful life. The principal lives for major classes of plant and equipment are summarized in Note 8,\nPlant and Equipment, net\n.\nSelling and Administrative\nThe principal components of selling and administrative expenses are compensation, advertising, and promotional costs.\nPostemployment Benefits\nWe provide termination benefits to employees as part of ongoing benefit arrangements and record a liability for termination benefits when probable and estimable. These criteria are met when management, with the appropriate level of authority, approves and commits to its plan of action for termination; the plan identifies the employees to be terminated and their related benefits; and the plan is to be completed within one year. We do not provide material one-time benefit arrangements.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe are required to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial measurement or for subsequent accounting or reporting. For example, fair value is used in the initial measurement of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination; on a recurring basis in the measurement of derivative financial instruments; and on a nonrecurring basis when long-lived assets are written down to fair value when held for sale or determined to be impaired. Refer to Note 13,\nFair Value Measurements\n, and Note 15,\nRetirement Benefits\n, for information on the methods and assumptions used in our fair value measurements.\nFinancial Instruments\nWe address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The types of derivative financial instruments permitted for such risk management programs are specified in policies set by management. Refer to Note 12,\nFinancial Instruments\n, for further detail on the types and use of derivative instruments into which we enter.\nMajor financial institutions are counterparties to all of these derivative contracts. We have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better. Management believes the risk of incurring losses related to credit risk is remote, and any losses would be immaterial to the consolidated financial results, financial condition, or liquidity.\nWe recognize derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. On the date the derivative instrument is entered into, we generally designate the derivative as either (1) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge), (2) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge), or (3) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge).\n60\nThe following details the accounting treatment of our cash flow, fair value, net investment, and non-designated hedges:\n•\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and meets the cash flow hedge criteria are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (\"AOCL\") to the extent effective and then recognized in earnings when the hedged items affect earnings.\n•\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and meets all the required criteria for a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings.\n•\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative and foreign currency debt that are designated as and meet all the required criteria for a hedge of a net investment are recorded as translation adjustments in AOCL.\n•\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedge are recorded immediately in earnings.\nWe formally document the relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes relating derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, we will discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.\nForeign Currency\nSince we do business in many foreign countries, fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our financial position and results of operations.\nIn most of our foreign operations, the local currency is considered the functional currency. Foreign subsidiaries translate their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. The gains or losses that result from this process are shown as translation adjustments in AOCL in the equity section of the balance sheet.\nThe revenue and expense accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates that prevail during the period. Therefore, the U.S. dollar value of these items on the consolidated income statements fluctuates from period to period, depending on the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. Some transactions are made in currencies different from an entity’s functional currency. Gains and losses from these foreign currency transactions, and the impact of related hedges, are generally reflected in \"Other income (expense), net\" on our consolidated income statements as they occur and were not material for the periods presented.\nForeign exchange gains and losses from the foreign currency remeasurement of balances associated with intercompany and third-party financing transactions, related income tax assets and liabilities, and the impact of related hedges are reflected within “Other non-operating income (expense), net\" and were not material for the periods presented.\nIn addition, foreign currency forward points and currency swap basis differences that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness of our cash flow hedges of intercompany loans (“excluded components”) are recorded within “Other non-operating income (expense), net\" on a straight-line basis. Excluded components were expenses of $\n31.0\n, $\n33.5\n, and $\n33.3\nin fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In 2019, excluded components were recorded in “Interest expense” and were not restated upon adoption of accounting guidance in fiscal year 2020 on hedging activities.\n61\nEnvironmental Expenditures\nAccruals for environmental loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Remediation costs are capitalized if the costs improve our property as compared with the condition of the property when originally constructed or acquired, or if the costs prevent environmental contamination from future operations. We expense environmental costs related to existing conditions resulting from past or current operations and from which no current or future benefit is discernible. The amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled\n$\n18.6\n, $\n18.3\n, and $\n14.2\nin fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In addition, we recorded a pre-tax expense of $\n19.0\nin results from discontinued operations to increase our environmental accrual for the Pace facility in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. Refer to the Pace discussion within Note 16,\nCommitments and Contingencies\n, for additional information.\nThe measurement of environmental liabilities is based on an evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual site and considers factors such as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. An environmental liability related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include, for example, a provision for one or more of the following types of costs: site investigation and testing costs, remediation costs, post-remediation monitoring costs, natural resource damages, and outside legal fees. These liabilities include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that we have reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. They do not consider any claims for recoveries from insurance or other parties and are not discounted.\nAs assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the amount of projected cost is reviewed and the liability is adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available. Management has an established process in place to identify and monitor our environmental exposures. An environmental accrual analysis is prepared and maintained that lists all environmental loss contingencies, even where an accrual has not been established. This analysis assists in monitoring our overall environmental exposure and serves as a tool to facilitate ongoing communication among our technical experts, environmental managers, environmental lawyers, and financial management to ensure that required accruals are recorded and potential exposures disclosed.\nGiven inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures, actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates. Refer to Note 16,\nCommitments and Contingencies\n, for additional information on our environmental loss contingencies.\nThe accruals for environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, primarily as part of other noncurrent liabilities.\nLitigation\nIn the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings. We accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. The accrual for a litigation loss contingency includes estimates of potential damages and other directly related costs expected to be incurred. Refer to Note 16,\nCommitments and Contingencies\n, for additional information on our current legal proceedings.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe expense the grant-date fair value of our share-based awards over the vesting period during which employees perform related services. Expense recognition is accelerated for retirement-eligible individuals who would meet the requirements for vesting of awards upon their retirement. Refer to Note 18,\nShare-Based Compensation\n, for additional information regarding these awards and the models and assumptions used to determine the grant-date fair value of our awards.\n62\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A principal temporary difference results from the excess of tax depreciation over book depreciation because accelerated methods of depreciation and shorter useful lives are used for income tax purposes. The cumulative impact of a change in tax rates or regulations is included in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. We recognize deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowances to the extent we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized considering all available evidence.\nA tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on its technical merits. This position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense. For additional information regarding our income taxes, refer to Note 21,\nIncome Taxes\n.\nOther Non-Operating Income (Expense), net\nOther non-operating income (expense), net includes interest income associated with our cash and cash items and short-term investments, certain foreign currency remeasurements and impacts from the related hedging activities discussed in the\nForeign Currency\nsection above, and non-service cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. Our non-service costs primarily include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses, and settlements.\nCash and Cash Items\nCash and cash items include cash, time deposits, and treasury securities acquired with an original maturity of three months or less.\nShort-term Investments\nShort-term investments include time deposits and treasury securities with original maturities greater than three months and less than one year.\nCredit Losses\nWe are exposed to credit losses through sales of products and services. When extending credit, we evaluate customer creditworthiness based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative factors that include, but are not limited to, the customer’s credit score from external providers, financial condition, and past payment experience.\nWe assess allowances for credit losses on our trade receivables and lease receivable portfolios. Allowances are evaluated by portfolio on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist. A provision for customer defaults is made on a general formula basis as the risk of some default is expected but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The assessment of the likelihood of default is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical experience, existing economic conditions, and forward-looking information. When we identify specific customers with known collectability issues, the assessment for credit losses is performed on an individual basis, considering current and forward-looking information of the customer.\nThe use of forward-looking information considers economic conditions that may affect the customers’ ability to pay. Although we historically have not experienced significant credit losses, our exposure to credit losses may increase if our customers are adversely affected by economic pressures or uncertainty associated with local or global economic recessions, disruption associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or other customer-specific factors. We review our reserves for credit losses on a quarterly basis.\n63\nTrade receivables comprise amounts owed to us through our operating activities and are presented net of allowances for credit losses.\nChanges to the carrying amount of the allowance for credit losses on trade receivables are summarized below:\nIn addition, our lease receivables are presented net of allowances for credit losses. As of 30 September 2021 and 2020, the credit quality of lease receivables did not require a material allowance for credit losses. For additional information on our lease arrangements, refer to Note 11,\nLeases\n.\nInventories\nWe carry inventory that is comprised of finished goods, work-in-process, raw materials and supplies. Refer to Note 6,\nInventories\n, for further detail.\nInventories on our consolidated balance sheets are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine the cost of all our inventories on a first-in, first-out basis (\"FIFO\"). We write down our inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.\nEquity Method Investments\nThe equity method of accounting is used when we exercise significant influence but do not have operating control, generally assumed to be 20% – 50% ownership. Under the equity method, original investments are recorded at cost and adjusted by our share of undistributed earnings or losses of these companies. We use the cumulative earnings approach for determining cash flow presentation of cash distributions received from equity method investees. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.\nPlant and Equipment, net\nPlant and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Construction costs, labor, and applicable overhead related to installations are capitalized. Expenditures for additions and improvements that extend the lives or increase the capacity of plant assets are capitalized. The costs of maintenance and repairs of plant and equipment are charged to expense as incurred.\nFully depreciated assets are retained in the gross plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until they are removed from service. In the case of disposals, assets and related depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the net amounts, less proceeds from disposal, are included in income. Refer to Note 8,\nPlant and Equipment, net\n, for further detail.\n64\nComputer Software\nWe capitalize costs incurred to purchase or develop software for internal use. Capitalized costs include purchased computer software packages, payments to vendors/consultants for development and implementation or modification to a purchased package to meet our requirements, payroll and related costs for employees directly involved in development, and interest incurred while software is being developed. Capitalized costs are reflected in \"Plant and equipment, net\" on the consolidated balance sheets and are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software, generally a period of\nthree\nto\nfive years\n.\nWe capitalize costs incurred with the implementation of a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract, consistent with our policy for software developed or obtained for internal use. However, the capitalized costs are reflected in \"Other noncurrent assets\" on our consolidated balance sheets and expensed over the term of the related hosting arrangement.\nCapitalized Interest\nAs we build new plant and equipment, we include in the cost of these assets a portion of the interest payments we make during the year. The amount of capitalized interest was $\n28.3\n, $\n15.9\n, and $\n13.5\nin fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nLeases\nAs lessee, we recognize a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with a term in excess of 12 months. We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. The arrangement contains a lease when there is an identifiable asset, we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from that asset, and we direct how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the arrangement. If the initial term of an arrangement is 12 months or less, we have made an accounting election to not assess if these arrangements contain a lease for inclusion on our balance sheet.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Since our leases generally do not provide an implicit discount rate, we use our incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. To determine the incremental borrowing rate, we consider our unsecured borrowings and published market rates, and then adjust those rates to assume full collateralization and to factor in the individual lease term, geography, and payment structure.\nOur lease term includes periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise an option to extend or not exercise an option to terminate. Lease payments consider our practical expedient to combine amounts for lease and related non-lease components for all classes of underlying assets in which we are lessee. Fixed payments and payments associated with escalation clauses based on an index are included in the ROU asset and lease liability at commencement. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Our variable lease payments primarily include the impact from escalation clauses that are not fixed or based on an index. Prepaid lease payments are included in the recognition of ROU assets. Our lease agreements do not contain any material lease incentives, residual value guarantees or restrictions or covenants.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If an asset group is considered impaired, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset group’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value. Long-lived assets meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\n65\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The fair value of the liability is measured using discounted estimated cash flows and is adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded. The corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s useful life. Our asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with on-site long-term supply contracts under which we have built a facility on land owned by the customer and are obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. Our asset retirement obligations totaled $\n269.6\nand $\n241.4\nat 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively. Refer to Note 16,\nCommitments and Contingencies\n, for further detail.\nGoodwill\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Any excess purchase price (plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree) over the fair market value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. Preliminary purchase price allocations are made at the date of acquisition and finalized when information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date needed to finalize underlying estimates is obtained or when we determine that such information is not obtainable, within a maximum measurement period of one year.\nGoodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually. In addition, goodwill is tested more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists. Refer to Note 9,\nGoodwill\n, for further detail.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets with determinable lives primarily consist of customer relationships, purchased patents and technology, and certain land use rights. The cost of intangible assets with determinable lives is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of economic benefit.\nNo\nresidual value is estimated for these intangible assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually. In addition, intangible assets are tested more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists.\nCustomer relationships are generally amortized over periods of\nfive\nto\ntwenty-five years\n. Purchased patents and technology and other finite-lived intangibles are generally amortized over periods of\nfive\nto\nfifteen years\n. Other intangibles includes certain land use rights, which are generally amortized over a period of\nfifty years\n. Amortizable lives are adjusted whenever there is a change in the estimated period of economic benefit. Refer to Note 10,\nIntangible Assets\n, for further detail.\nRetirement Benefits\nOur retirement benefit plans are discussed in Note 15,\nRetirement Benefits\n. The cost of benefits we contribute to defined contribution plans is recognized in the year earned. The cost of benefits under our defined benefit and other post-retirement plans is generally recognized over the employees’ service period. We use actuarial methods and assumptions in the valuation of defined benefit obligations and the determination of expense. Differences between actual and expected results or changes in the value of obligations and plan assets are recognized systematically over subsequent periods\n.\n2.\nNEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nAccounting Guidance Implemented in Fiscal Year 2021\nCredit Losses on Financial Instruments\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued guidance on the measurement of credit losses, which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets, including trade receivables and lease receivables, held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The method to determine a loss is different from the previous guidance, which delayed recognition of a credit loss until it was probable that a loss had been incurred. We adopted this guidance on 1 October 2020 using a modified retrospective approach with an after-tax cumulative-effect adjustment of $\n1.3\nto retained earnings. Refer to the “Major Accounting Polices – Credit Losses\" section of Note 1,\nMajor Accounting Policies\n, for a description of our accounting policy on credit losses.\n66\nCloud Computing Implementation Costs\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued guidance which aligns the capitalization requirements for implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the existing capitalization requirements for implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. We adopted this guidance prospectively at the beginning of fiscal year 2021. Eligible implementation costs previously capitalized in \"Plant and equipment, net\" were reclassified to \"Other noncurrent assets\" on our consolidated balance sheets beginning in fiscal year 2021. This guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued an update to simplify the accounting for income taxes and improve consistent application by clarifying or amending existing guidance. We adopted this guidance at the beginning of fiscal year 2021. This guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nNew Accounting Guidance to be Implemented\nReference Rate Reform\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued an update to provide practical expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. This update is primarily applicable to our contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR. The amendments may be applied to impacted contracts and hedges prospectively through 31 December 2022. We had no impacts on our hedging relationships related to reference rate reform in fiscal year 2021. We will continue to evaluate the impact this guidance could have on our consolidated financial statements.\n3.\nACQUISITIONS\nFiscal Year 2021\nGain on Exchange With Joint Venture Partner\nAs of 30 September 2020, we held a\n50\n% ownership interest in Tyczka Industrie-Gases GmbH (\"TIG\"), a joint venture in Germany with the Tyczka Group that is primarily a merchant gases business. We accounted for this arrangement as an equity method investment in our Industrial Gases – EMEA segment.\nEffective 23 February 2021 (the \"acquisition date\"), we agreed with our joint venture partner to separate TIG into\ntwo\nseparate businesses. On the acquisition date, we acquired a portion of the business on a\n100\n% basis, and our partner paid us $\n10.8\nto acquire the rest of the business. The exchange resulted in a gain of $\n36.8\n($\n27.3\nafter-tax), which is reflected as “Gain on exchange with joint venture partner” on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021. The gain included $\n12.7\nfrom the revaluation of our previously held equity interest in the portion of the business that we retained and $\n24.1\nfrom the sale of our equity interest in the remaining business. The gain was not recorded in segment results.\nWe estimated an acquisition date fair value of $\n15.4\nfor our previously held equity interest in the acquired portion of the business using a market approach, which considered historical earnings and the application of a market-based multiple derived from comparable transactions.\nWe accounted for the acquisition as a business combination within our Industrial Gases – EMEA segment. As a result of the acquisition, we recognized intangible assets of $\n16.7\nfor customer relationships, goodwill of $\n14.5\n, and plant and equipment of $\n10.3\n. The customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of approximately\n15\nyears.\nThe acquired assets were recorded at their estimated fair values based primarily on a preliminary purchase price allocation. We may record adjustments to these assets during the preliminary purchase price allocation period, which could be up to one year from the acquisition date.\nWe expect the acquisition to allow us to have more control over the business we retained and to serve customers more effectively. The results of this business did not materially impact our consolidated income statements for the periods presented.\n67\nFiscal Year 2020\nAsset Acquisition\nOn 17 April 2020, we acquired\nfive\noperating hydrogen production plants from PBF Energy Inc. (\"PBF\") and commenced contractual long-term supply of hydrogen from those plants to PBF's refineries. We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition and recorded the aggregate purchase price of $\n580\nto plant and equipment on our consolidated balance sheets.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe completed\nthree\nacquisitions on 1 July 2020 that were accounted for as business combinations. These acquisitions had an aggregate purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $\n185.4\n. The largest of these acquisitions was the purchase of Oxygen & Argon Works Ltd., the leading manufacturer and marketer of industrial gases in Israel, primarily offering merchant gas products. The results of this business are consolidated within our Industrial Gases – EMEA segment.\nFiscal Year 2019\nAs further discussed below, we completed\nthree\nbusiness combinations in fiscal year 2019.\nExchange of Equity Affiliate Investments\nWe previously held\n50\n% ownership interests in High-Tech Gases (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (\"High-Tech Gases\") and WuXi Hi-Tech Gas Co., Ltd. (\"WuXi\"), both of which were joint ventures with another industrial gas company in China. We accounted for these arrangements as equity method investments in our Industrial Gases – Asia segment through 30 April 2019.\nOn 1 May 2019, we acquired our partner's\n50\n% interest in WuXi in exchange for our\n50\n% interest in High-Tech Gases. The exchange resulted in a net gain of $\n29.1\n, of which $\n15.0\nresulted from the revaluation of our previously held equity interest in WuXi to its acquisition date fair value and $\n14.1\nresulted from the disposition of our interest in High-Tech Gases. The net gain is reflected as \"Gain on exchange with joint venture partner\" on our consolidated income statements in fiscal year 2019 and was not recorded in results of the Industrial Gases – Asia segment.\nWe revalued our previously held\n50\n% equity interest in WuXi based on an estimated acquisition date fair value of $\n27.0\n. We calculated this fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis under the income approach, which required estimates and assumptions regarding projected revenue growth, customer attrition rates, profit margin, and discount rate.\nThe acquisition of the remaining interest in WuXi was accounted for as a business combination. The results of this business are consolidated within our Industrial Gases – Asia segment.\nOther Fiscal Year 2019 Business Combinations\nThe remaining business combinations completed in fiscal year 2019 had total consideration, net of cash acquired, of $\n126.6\n. The largest of these business combinations was the acquisition of ACP Europe SA (\"ACP\"), the largest independent carbon dioxide business in Continental Europe. The results of this business are consolidated within our Industrial Gases – EMEA segment.\n68\n4.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nNature of Goods and Services\nThe principal activities from which we generate sales from our contracts with customers, separated between our regional industrial gases businesses and industrial gases equipment businesses, are described below with their respective revenue recognition policies. For an overall summary of these policies and discussion on payment terms and presentation, refer to Note 1,\nMajor Accounting Policies\n.\nIndustrial Gases – Regional\nOur regional industrial gases businesses produce and sell atmospheric gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, and argon (primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air) and process gases such as hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, syngas, and specialty gases. We distribute gases to our sale of gas customers through different supply modes depending on various factors including the customer's volume requirements and location. Our supply modes are as follows:\n•\nOn-site Gases\n—Supply mode associated with customers who require large volumes of gases and have relatively constant demand. Gases are produced and supplied by large facilities on or near the customers’ facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities. These sale of gas contracts generally have\n15\n- to\n20\n- year terms. We also deliver smaller quantities of product through small on-site plants (cryogenic or non-cryogenic generators), typically via\n10\n- to\n15\n- year sale of gas contracts. The contracts within this supply mode generally contain fixed monthly charges and/or minimum purchase requirements with price escalation provisions that are generally based on external indices. Revenue associated with this supply mode is generally recognized over time during the period in which we deliver or make available the agreed upon quantity of goods.\n•\nMerchant Gases\n—Supply mode associated with liquid bulk and packaged gases customers. Liquid bulk customers receive delivery of product in liquid or gaseous form by tanker or tube trailer. The product is stored, usually in its liquid state, in equipment we typically design and install at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed. Packaged gases customers receive small quantities of product delivered in either cylinders or dewars. Both liquid bulk and packaged gases sales do not contain minimum purchase requirements as they are governed by contracts and/or purchase orders based on the customer's requirements. These contracts contain stated terms that are generally\n5\nyears or less. Performance obligations associated with this supply mode are satisfied at a point in time when the customer receives and obtains control of the product, which generally occurs upon delivery.\nThe timing of revenue recognition for our regional industrial gases businesses is generally consistent with our right to invoice the customer. Variable components of consideration that may not be resolved within the month, such as the ability to earn an annual bonus or incur a penalty, are more relevant to on-site contracts and are considered constrained as they can be impacted by a single significant event such as a plant outage, which could occur at the end of a contract period. We consider contract modifications on an individual basis to determine appropriate accounting treatment. However, contract modifications are generally accounted for prospectively as they relate to distinct goods or services associated with future periods of performance.\nWe mitigate energy and natural gas price risk contractually through pricing formulas, surcharges, and cost pass-through arrangements.\nIndustrial Gases – Equipment\nWe design and manufacture equipment for air separation, hydrocarbon recovery and purification, natural gas liquefaction, and liquid helium and liquid hydrogen transport and storage. The Industrial Gases – Global and the Corporate and other segments serve our sale of equipment customers.\nOur sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation as the individual promised goods or services contained within the contracts are integrated with or dependent upon other goods or services in the contract for a single output to the customer.\n69\nRevenue from our sale of equipment contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use. Otherwise, sale of equipment contracts are satisfied at the point in time the customer obtains control of the equipment, which is generally determined based on the shipping terms of the contract. For contracts recognized over time, we primarily recognize revenue using a cost incurred input method by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer.\nSince our contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation, contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. In addition, changes in estimates on projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. Changes in estimates unfavorably impacted operating income by approximately $\n19\nin fiscal year 2021. Changes in estimates favorably impacted operating income by approximately $\n7\nand $\n37\nin fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our changes in estimates would not have significantly impacted amounts recorded in prior years.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe table below presents our consolidated sales disaggregated by supply mode for each of our reporting segments. We believe this presentation best depicts the nature, timing, type of customer, and contract terms for our sales.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of 30 September 2021, the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is estimated to be approximately $\n24\nbillion. This amount includes fixed-charge contract provisions associated with our on-site and sale of equipment supply modes. We estimate that approximately half of this revenue will be recognized over approximately the next five years and the balance thereafter.\nExpected revenue associated with new on-site plants that are not yet on stream is excluded from this amount. In addition, this amount excludes consideration associated with contracts having an expected duration of less than one year, and variable consideration for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice, including pass-through costs related to energy and natural gas.\nIn the future, actual amounts will differ due to events outside of our control, including, but not limited to, inflationary price escalations; currency exchange rates; and amended, terminated, or renewed contracts.\n70\nContract Balances\nThe table below details balances arising from contracts with customers:\nContract assets and liabilities result from differences in timing of revenue recognition and customer invoicing. These balances are reported on the consolidated balance sheets on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\nContract assets primarily relate to our sale of equipment contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. These balances represent unbilled revenue, which occurs when revenue recognized under the measure of progress exceeds the amount invoiced to our customers. Our ability to invoice the customer for contract asset balances is not only based on the passage of time, but also the achievement of certain contractual milestones.\nContract fulfillment costs primarily include deferred costs related to sale of equipment projects that cannot be inventoried and for which we expect to recognize revenue upon transfer of control at project completion or costs related to fulfilling a specific anticipated contract.\nCosts to obtain a contract, or contract acquisition costs, are capitalized only after we have established a contract with the customer. We elected to apply the practical expedient to expense these costs as they are incurred if the amortization period of the asset that would have otherwise been recognized is one year or less. Our contract acquisition costs capitalized as of 30 September 2021 and 2020 were not material.\nContract liabilities include advance payments or right to consideration prior to performance under the contract. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when or as we perform under the contract. The increase in our contract liabilities – current balance primarily relates to new sale of equipment projects as balances associated with our sale of gas contracts are generally related to fixed charges and are relatively consistent period over period. During the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021, we recognized approximately $\n240\nin revenue associated with sale of equipment contracts that was included within our contract liabilities as of 30 September 2020. Advanced payments from our customers do not represent a significant financing component as these payments are intended for purposes other than financing, such as to meet working capital demands or to protect us from our customer failing to meet its obligations under the terms of the contract.\nChanges in contract asset and liability balances during the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021 were not materially impacted by any other factors.\n5.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nIn fiscal year 2021, income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $\n70.3\n. This included net tax benefits of $\n60.0\nrecorded upon release of tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions for which the statute of limitations expired. Of this benefit, we recorded $\n51.8\nin the fourth quarter for liabilities associated with our former Performance Materials Division (\"PMD\") and $\n8.2\nin the third quarter for liabilities associated with our former Energy-from-Waste (\"EfW\") business. Additionally, we recorded a tax benefit of $\n10.3\nin the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 primarily from the settlement of a state tax appeal related to the gain on the sale of PMD in fiscal year 2017. Our consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021 includes $\n6.7\nreceived as part of the settlement.\nIn fiscal year 2020, loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $\n14.3\n. This resulted from a pre-tax loss of $\n19.0\nrecorded in the second quarter to increase our existing liability for retained environmental obligations associated with the sale of our former Amines business in September 2006. Refer to the Pace discussion within Note 16,\nCommitments and Contingencies\n, for additional information. The loss did not have an impact on our cash flows for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020\n.\n71\n6.\nINVENTORIES\nThe components of inventories are as follows:\n7.\nSUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF EQUITY AFFILIATES\nThe summarized financial information below is on a combined 100% basis and has been compiled based on financial statements of the companies accounted for by the equity method. The amounts presented include the accounts of the following equity affiliates:\nDividends received from equity affiliates were $\n157.3\n, $\n107.0\n, and $\n144.3\nin fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nThe investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates as of 30 September 2021 and 2020 included investment in foreign affiliates of $\n1,648.0\nand $\n1,431.3\n, respectively.\nAs of 30 September 2021 and 2020, the amount of investment in companies accounted for by the equity method included equity method goodwill of $\n55.3\nand $\n50.0\n, respectively.\nIndia Finance Act 2020\nOur consolidated income statements in fiscal year 2020 include a benefit of $\n33.8\nreflected in equity affiliates' income for our share of accumulated dividend distribution taxes released with respect to INOX Air Products Private Limited, an equity affiliate investment in our Industrial Gases – Asia segment. This benefit, which related to tax legislation passed by the Indian government, was not recorded in segment results. Refer to Note 21,\nIncome Taxes\n, for additional information. The benefit is included in fiscal year 2020 net income in the table above on a 100% basis.\n72\nJazan Gas Project Company\nOn 19 April 2015, Jazan Gas Project Company, a joint venture between Air Products and ACWA Holding, entered into a 20-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement to supply Aramco’s oil refinery and power plant being built in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. We own\n26\n% of the joint venture and guarantee repayment of our share of an equity bridge loan. ACWA also guarantees their share of the loan. We determined that the joint venture is a variable interest entity for which we are not the primary beneficiary. As of 30 September 2021, our consolidated balance sheets included $\n94.4\nreflected within \"Payables and accrued liabilities\" for our obligation to make equity contributions based on our proportionate share of the advances received by the joint venture under the loan.\nSubsequent Event\nAs part of the Jazan Integrated Gasification and Power Company transaction discussed in Note 24,\nSubsequent Events\n, Jazan Gas Project Company sold its air separation units to Aramco in October 2021 and repaid its outstanding debt, including the equity bridge loan.\n8.\nPLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nThe major classes of plant and equipment are as follows:\n(A)\nDepreciable lives of production facilities related to long-term customer supply contracts are generally matched to the contract lives.\n(B)\nThe depreciable lives for various types of distribution equipment are:\n10\nto\n25\nyears for cylinders, depending on the nature and properties of the product;\n20\nyears for tanks; generally\n7.5\nyears for customer stations; and\n5\nto\n15\nyears for tractors and trailers.\nDepreciation expense was $\n1,284.1\n, $\n1,150.5\n, and $\n1,049.7\nin fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n9.\nGOODWILL\nChanges to the carrying amount of consolidated goodwill by segment are as follows:\nIn fiscal year 2021, goodwill acquired is primarily attributable to expected cost synergies and growth opportunities related to a business combination completed in the second quarter. This goodwill is\nno\nt deductible for tax purposes. Refer to Note 3,\nAcquisitions\n, for additional information.\n73\n(A)\nAccumulated impairment losses include the impacts of currency translation. These losses are attributable to our Latin America reporting unit (\"LASA\") within the Industrial Gases – Americas segment.\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable. The impairment test for goodwill involves calculating the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing that value to the carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the difference is recorded as a goodwill impairment charge, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test and determined that the fair value of all our reporting units exceeded their carrying value.\n10.\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe table below summarizes the major classes of our intangible assets:\nThe decrease in net intangible assets in fiscal year 2021 was primarily attributable to amortization, partially offset by intangible assets acquired through business combinations.\nAmortization expense for intangible assets was $\n37.2\n, $\n34.5\n, and $\n33.1\nin fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Refer to Note 1,\nMajor Accounting Policies\n, for the amortization periods for each major class of intangible assets.\nThe table below details the amount of amortization expense expected to be recorded for our finite-lived intangible assets in each of the next five years and thereafter:\n74\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and comparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we conducted our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets and determined that the fair value of all our intangible assets exceeded their carrying value.\n11.\nLEASES\nLessee Accounting\nWe are the lessee under various agreements for real estate, vehicles, aircraft, and other equipment that are accounted for as operating leases. Our finance leases principally relate to the right to use machinery and equipment and are not material.\nOperating lease expense was $\n89.5\nand $\n80.1\nfor fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts exclude short-term and variable lease expenses, which were not material.\nAmounts associated with operating leases and their presentation on our consolidated balance sheets are as follows:\n(A)\nCalculated on the basis of the remaining lease term and the lease liability balance for each lease as of the reporting date.\n(B)\nCalculated on the basis of the discount rate used to calculate the lease liability for each lease and the remaining balance of the lease payments for each lease as of the reporting date.\nThe following maturity analysis of our operating lease liabilities as of 30 September 2021 presents the undiscounted cash flows for each of the next five years and thereafter with a reconciliation to the lease liability recognized on our balance sheet:\nThe impacts associated with our operating leases on the consolidated statements of cash flows are reflected within \"Other adjustments\" within operating activities. This includes non-cash operating lease expense of $\n89.5\nand $\n80.1\n, as well as a use of cash of $\n98.8\nand $\n90.0\nfor payments on amounts included in the measurement of the lease liability for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n75\nWe recorded $\n259\nand $\n442\nof noncash right-of-use asset additions during fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWe have additional operating leases that have not yet commenced as of 30 September 2021 having lease payments totaling approximately $\n195\n.\nLessor Accounting\nCertain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer have been accounted for as leases. As we generally control the operations and maintenance of the assets that provide the supply of gas to our customers, there have been no new arrangements that qualified as a lease in fiscal year 2021.\nIn cases where operating lease treatment is appropriate, there is no difference in revenue recognition over the life of the contract as compared to accounting for the contract under a sale of gas agreement. These contracts qualify for a practical expedient available to lessors to combine the lease and non-lease components and account for the combined component in accordance with the accounting treatment for the predominant component. We elected to apply this practical expedient and have accounted for the combined component as product sales under the revenue standard as we control the operations and maintenance of the assets that provide the supply of gas to our customers.\nIn cases where sales-type lease treatment is appropriate, revenue and expense are recognized up front for the sale of equipment component of the contract as compared to revenue recognition over the life of the arrangement under contracts not qualifying as sales-type leases. Additionally, a portion of the revenue representing interest income from the financing component of the lease receivable is reflected as sales over the life of the contract. During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we recognized interest income of $\n67.4\nand $\n71.2\non our lease receivables, respectively.\nOur contracts generally do not have the option to extend or terminate the lease or provide the customer the right to purchase the asset at the end of the contract term. Instead, renewal of such contracts requires negotiation of mutually agreed terms by both parties. Unless the customer terminates within the required notice period, the contract will go into evergreen. Given the long-term duration of our contracts, there is no assumed residual value for the assets at the end of the lease term.\nLease receivables, net, primarily relate to sales-type leases on certain on-site assets which are collected over the contract term. As of 30 September 2021 and 2020, our lease receivables, net were $\n824.7\nand $\n903.0\n, respectively. Lease receivables, net are primarily included within \"Noncurrent lease receivables\" on our consolidated balance sheets, with the remaining balance in \"Other receivables and current assets.\" The majority of our leases are of high credit quality and were originated prior to fiscal year 2017. As of 30 September 2021 and 2020, the credit quality of lease receivables did not require a material allowance for credit losses.\nLease payments collected in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $\n166.2\n, $\n162.8\n, and $\n171.6\n, respectively. These payments reduced the lease receivable balance by $\n98.8\n, $\n91.6\n, and $\n94.6\nin fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nAs of 30 September 2021, minimum lease payments expected to be collected, which reconciles to lease receivables, net, were as follows:\n76\n12.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nCurrency Price Risk Management\nOur earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency-denominated transactions and net investments in foreign operations. It is our policy to seek to minimize our cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates. This is accomplished by identifying and evaluating the risk that our cash flows will change in value due to changes in exchange rates and by executing strategies necessary to manage such exposures. Our objective is to maintain economically balanced currency risk management strategies that provide adequate downside protection.\nForward Exchange Contracts\nWe enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce the cash flow exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with highly anticipated cash flows and certain firm commitments, such as the purchase of plant and equipment. We also enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge the cash flow exposure on intercompany loans and third-party debt. This portfolio of forward exchange contracts consists primarily of Euros and U.S. Dollars. The maximum remaining term of any forward exchange contract currently outstanding and designated as a cash flow hedge at 30 September 2021 is\n3.2\nyears.\nForward exchange contracts are also used to hedge the value of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates by creating a liability in a currency in which we have a net equity position. The primary currency pair in this portfolio of forward exchange contracts is Euros and U.S. Dollars.\nWe also utilize forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges. These contracts are used to economically hedge foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily working capital. The primary objective of these forward exchange contracts is to protect the value of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange rates that might occur prior to their receipt or settlement. This portfolio of forward exchange contracts consists of many different foreign currency pairs, with a profile that changes from time to time depending on our business activity and sourcing decisions.\nThe table below summarizes our outstanding currency price risk management instruments:\nThe decrease in the notional value of forward exchange contracts that are not designated is primarily due to maturities.\nWe also use foreign currency-denominated debt to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The designated foreign currency-denominated debt and related accrued interest was €\n1,297.5\nmillion ($\n1,502.6\n) at 30 September 2021 and €\n1,288.7\nmillion ($\n1,510.8\n) at 30 September 2020. The designated foreign currency-denominated debt is presented within \"Long-term debt\" on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDebt Portfolio Management\nIt is our policy to identify, on a continuing basis, the need for debt capital and to evaluate the financial risks inherent in funding the Company with debt capital. Reflecting the result of this ongoing review, our debt portfolio and hedging program are managed with the intent to (1) reduce funding risk with respect to borrowings made by us to preserve our access to debt capital and provide debt capital as required for funding and liquidity purposes, and (2) manage the aggregate interest rate risk and the debt portfolio in accordance with certain debt management parameters.\n77\nInterest Rate Management Contracts\nWe enter into interest rate swaps to change the fixed/variable interest rate mix of our debt portfolio in order to maintain the percentage of fixed- and variable-rate debt within the parameters set by management. In accordance with these parameters, the agreements are used to manage interest rate risks and costs inherent in our debt portfolio. Our interest rate management portfolio generally consists of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps (which are designated as fair value hedges), pre-issuance interest rate swaps and treasury locks (which hedge the interest rate risk associated with anticipated fixed-rate debt issuances and are designated as cash flow hedges), and floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps (which are designated as cash flow hedges). As of 30 September 2021, the outstanding interest rate swaps were denominated in U.S. Dollars. The notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements is equal to or less than the designated debt being hedged. When interest rate swaps are used to hedge variable-rate debt, the indices of the swaps and the debt to which they are designated are the same. It is our policy not to enter into any interest rate management contracts which lever a move in interest rates on a greater than one-to-one basis.\nCross Currency Interest Rate Swap Contracts\nWe enter into cross currency interest rate swap contracts when our risk management function deems necessary. These contracts may entail both the exchange of fixed- and floating-rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreement and the exchange of one currency for another currency at inception and at a specified future date. The contracts are used to hedge either certain net investments in foreign operations or non-functional currency cash flows related to intercompany loans. The current cross currency interest rate swap portfolio consists of fixed-to-fixed swaps primarily between U.S. Dollars and Chinese Renminbi, U.S. Dollars and Indian Rupee, and U.S. Dollars and Chilean Pesos.\nThe table below summarizes our outstanding interest rate management contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps:\nThe table below provides the amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges:\n78\nThe table below summarizes the fair value and balance sheet location of our outstanding derivatives. Refer to Note 13,\nFair Value Measurements\n, which defines fair value, describes the method for measuring fair value, and provides additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements.\nThe table below summarizes gains (losses) recognized in other comprehensive income during the period related to our net investment and cash flow hedging relationships:\n(A)\nOther primarily includes interest rate and cross currency interest rate swaps for which excluded components are recognized in “Payables and accrued liabilities” and “Other receivables and current assets” as a component of accrued interest payable and accrued interest receivable, respectively. These excluded components are recorded in “Other non-operating income (expense), net” over the life of the cross currency interest rate swap. Other also includes the recognition of our share of gains and losses, net of tax, related to interest rate swaps held by our equity affiliates\n.\n79\nThe table below summarizes the location and amounts recognized in income related to our cash flow and fair value hedging relationships by contract type:\nThe table below summarizes the location and amounts recognized in income related to our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments by contract type:\nThe amount of unrealized gains and losses related to cash flow hedges as of 30 September 2021 that are expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next twelve months is not material.\nThe cash flows related to all derivative contracts are reported in the operating activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n80\nCredit Risk-Related Contingent Features\nCertain derivative instruments are executed under agreements that require us to maintain a minimum credit rating with both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. If our credit rating falls below this threshold, the counterparty to the derivative instruments has the right to request full collateralization on the derivatives’ net liability position. The net liability position of derivatives with credit risk-related contingent features was $\n53.4\nand $\n30.0\nas of 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively. Because our current credit rating is above the various pre-established thresholds,\nno\ncollateral has been posted on these liability positions.\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\nWe execute financial derivative transactions with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions, all of which are investment grade at this time. Some of our underlying derivative agreements give us the right to require the institution to post collateral if its credit rating falls below the pre-established thresholds with Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s. The collateral that the counterparties would be required to post was $\n38.1\nand $\n76.5\nas of 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively. No financial institution is required to post collateral at this time, as all have credit ratings at or above threshold.\n13.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair value is defined as an exit price, or the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as follows:\n•\nLevel 1\n—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2\n—Inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n•\nLevel 3\n—Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability based on our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe methods and assumptions used to measure the fair value of financial instruments are as follows:\nShort-term Investments\nShort-term investments primarily include time deposits with original maturities greater than three months and less than one year. We estimated the fair value of our short-term investments, which approximates carrying value as of the balance sheet date, using Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. Level 2 measurements were based on current interest rates for similar investments with comparable credit risk and time to maturity.\nDerivatives\nThe fair value of our interest rate management contracts and forward exchange contracts are quantified using the income approach and are based on estimates using standard pricing models. These models consider the value of future cash flows as of the balance sheet date, discounted to a present value using discount factors that match both the time to maturity and currency of the underlying instruments. These standard pricing models utilize inputs that are derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rate yield curves as well as currency spot and forward rates; therefore, the fair value of our derivatives is classified as a Level 2 measurement. On an ongoing basis, we randomly test a subset of our valuations against valuations received from the transaction’s counterparty to validate the accuracy of our standard pricing models. Counterparties to these derivative contracts are highly rated financial institutions.\nRefer to Note 12,\nFinancial Instruments\n, for a description of derivative instruments, including details related to the balance sheet line classifications.\nLong-term Debt, Including Related Party\nThe fair value of our debt is based on estimates using standard pricing models that consider the value of future cash flows as of the balance sheet date, discounted to a present value using discount factors that match both the time to maturity and currency of the underlying instruments. These standard valuation models utilize observable market data such as interest rate yield curves and currency spot rates; therefore, the fair value of our debt is classified as a Level 2 measurement. We generally perform the computation of the fair value of these instruments.\n81\nThe carrying values and fair values of financial instruments were as follows:\nThe carrying amounts reported on the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash items, short-term investments, trade receivables, payables and accrued liabilities, accrued income taxes, and short-term borrowings approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Accordingly, these items have been excluded from the above table.\nThe following table summarizes assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\n82\n14.\nDEBT\nThe table below summarizes our total outstanding debt as reflected on our consolidated balance sheets:\n(A)\nIncludes bank obligations with weighted average interest rates of\n0.6\n% and\n1.6\n% as of 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(B)\nIncludes current portion of long-term debt owed to a related party of $\n83.8\nand $\n41.3\nas of 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nTotal related party debt, including the current portion, was $\n358.4\nand $\n338.5\nas of 30 September 2021 and 30 September 2020, respectively. This debt primarily relates to a loan with our joint venture partner, Lu’An Clean Energy Company, which partially funded the acquisition of their assets by a consolidated joint venture in 2018.\nThe table below summarizes the coupon interest rates, fiscal year maturities, and carrying amounts of our long-term debt, including current portion and amounts owed to related parties:\n(A)\nWe entered into LIBOR-based interest rate swaps with various financial institutions to hedge a portion of the\n3.0\n% Senior Note maturing in fiscal year 2022. These interest rate swaps have been designated as fair value hedges of the Note. Refer to Note 12,\nFinancial Instruments\n, for additional information.\n83\nPrincipal maturities of long-term debt, including current portion and amounts owed to related parties, in each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows:\nCash paid for interest, net of amounts capitalized, was $\n150.4\n, $\n67.2\n, and $\n155.9\nin fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nSubsequent Event\nIn November 2021, we repaid the\n3.0\n% Senior Note of $\n400\n, plus interest, on its maturity date.\nDebt Covenants\nVarious debt agreements to which we are a party include financial covenants and other restrictions, including restrictions pertaining to the ability to create property liens and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. As of 30 September 2021, we are in compliance with all the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements.\nCredit Facilities\nOn 31 March 2021, we entered into a\nfive-year\n$\n2,500\nrevolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the “2021 Credit Agreement”), under which senior unsecured debt is available to us and certain of our subsidiaries. The 2021 Credit Agreement provides a source of liquidity and supports our commercial paper program. The only financial covenant in the 2021 Credit Agreement is a maximum ratio of total debt to capitalization (equal to total debt plus total equity) not to exceed\n70\n%.\nNo\nborrowings were outstanding under the 2021 Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2021.\nThe 2021 Credit Agreement replaced our previous\nfive-year\n$\n2,300\nrevolving credit agreement, which was to have matured on 31 March 2022.\nNo\nborrowings were outstanding under the previous agreement as of 30 September 2020 or at the time of its termination.\nNo\nearly termination penalties were incurred.\nWe have credit facilities available to certain of our foreign subsidiaries totaling $\n296.7\n, of which $\n176.2\nwas borrowed and outstanding as of 30 September 2021.\n2020 Debt Issuance\nIn fiscal year 2020, we issued U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated fixed-rate notes with aggregate principal amounts of $\n3.8\nbillion and €\n1.0\nbillion, respectively. Our consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020 includes long-term debt proceeds of $\n4,895.8\nfrom these issuances.\n84\n15.\nRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans are the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. These plans were closed to new participants in 2005, after which defined contribution plans were offered to new employees. The principal defined contribution plan is the Retirement Savings Plan, in which a substantial portion of the U.S. employees participate. A similar plan is offered to U.K. employees. We also provide other postretirement benefits consisting primarily of healthcare benefits to U.S. retirees who meet age and service requirements.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nPension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment.\nThe components of net periodic (benefit) cost for our defined benefit pension plans for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 were as follows:\nOur service costs are primarily included within \"Cost of sales\" and \"Selling and administrative\" on our consolidated income statements. The amount of service costs capitalized in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 were not material. The non-service related costs, including pension settlement losses, are presented outside operating income within \"Other non-operating income (expense), net.\"\nCertain of our pension plans provide for a lump sum benefit payment option at the time of retirement, or for corporate officers, six months after their retirement date. A participant’s vested benefit is considered settled upon cash payment of the lump sum. We recognize pension settlement losses when cash payments exceed the sum of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost of the plan for the fiscal year. We recognized pension settlement losses of $\n1.3\n, $\n5.0\nand $\n6.2\nin fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, to accelerate recognition of a portion of actuarial losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with the U.S. supplementary pension plan.\nWe calculate net periodic benefit cost for a given fiscal year based on assumptions developed at the end of the previous fiscal year.\nThe following table sets forth the weighted average assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost:\n85\nThe projected benefit obligation (\"PBO\") is the actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee service rendered to date, including the effects of estimated future salary increases. The following table sets forth the weighted average assumptions used in the calculation of the PBO:\nThe following tables reflect the change in the PBO and the change in the fair value of plan assets based on the plan year measurement date, as well as the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets:\n86\nThe changes in plan assets and benefit obligation that have been recognized in other comprehensive income on a pretax basis during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 consist of the following:\nThe net actuarial gains and losses represent the actual changes in the estimated obligation and plan assets that have not yet been recognized in the consolidated income statements and are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Actuarial gains arising during fiscal year 2021 are primarily attributable to higher than expected return on plan assets and higher discount rates. Accumulated actuarial gains and losses that exceed a corridor are amortized over the average remaining service period of active U.S. participants, which was approximately\nseven years\nas of 30 September 2021. For U.K. participants, accumulated actuarial gains and losses that exceed a corridor are amortized over the average remaining life expectancy, which was approximately\ntwenty-four years\nas of 30 September 2021.\nThe components recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss on a pretax basis at 30 September consisted of the following:\nThe accumulated benefit obligation (\"ABO\") is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed to employee service rendered to a particular date, based on current salaries. The ABO for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n5,140.0\nand $\n5,166.5\nas of 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe following table provides information on pension plans where the benefit liability exceeds the value of plan assets:\nThe tables above include several pension arrangements that are not funded because of jurisdictional practice. The ABO and PBO related to these plans as of 30 September 2021 were $\n86.2\nand $\n91.7\n, respectively. As of 30 September 2021, the U.S. salaried and U.K. pension plans had plan assets in excess of both PBO and ABO resulting in a decrease to the U.S. and International balances presented above. As of 30 September 2020, the PBO of these plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets.\n87\nPension Plan Assets\nOur pension plan investment strategy is to invest in diversified portfolios to earn a long-term return consistent with acceptable risk in order to pay retirement benefits and meet regulatory funding requirements while minimizing company cash contributions over time. De-risking strategies are also employed for closed plans as funding improves, generally resulting in higher allocations to long duration bonds. The plans invest primarily in passive and actively managed equity and debt securities. Equity investments are diversified geographically and by investment style and market capitalization. Fixed income investments include sovereign, corporate and asset-backed securities generally denominated in the currency of the plan.\nAsset allocation targets are established based on the long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Assets are routinely rebalanced through contributions, benefit payments, and otherwise as deemed appropriate.\nThe actual and target allocations at the measurement date are as follows:\nIn fiscal year 2021, the\n6.75\n% expected return for U.S. plan assets was based on a weighted average of estimated long-term returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets. In determining asset class returns, we take into account historical long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as other economic and market factors.\nIn fiscal year 2021, the\n4.73\n% expected rate of return for international plan assets was based on a weighted average return for plans outside the U.S., which vary significantly in size, asset structure and expected returns. The expected asset return for the U.K. plan, which represents over\n80\n% of the assets of our International plans, is\n5.30\n% and was derived from expected equity and debt security returns.\n88\nThe table below summarizes pension plan assets measured at fair value by asset class (see Note 13,\nFair Value Measurements\n, for definition of the levels):\n(A)\nReal estate pooled funds consist of funds that invest in properties. These funds generally allow for quarterly redemption with 30 days' notice. Timing for redemption could be delayed based on the priority of our request and the availability of funds. Interests in these funds are valued using the net asset value (\"NAV\") per share practical expedient and are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe table below summarizes changes in fair value of the pension plan assets classified as Level 3, which is comprised of investments in insurance contracts:\n89\nThe descriptions and fair value methodologies for the U.S. and International pension plan assets are as follows:\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities are valued at the closing market price reported on a U.S. or international exchange where the security is actively traded and are therefore classified as Level 1 assets.\nEquity Mutual and Pooled Funds\nShares of mutual funds are valued at the daily closing price as reported by the fund. The mutual funds are required to publish their daily NAV and to transact at that price. The mutual funds are deemed to be actively traded and are classified as Level 1 assets. Units of pooled funds are valued at the per unit NAV determined by the fund manager based on the value of the underlying traded holdings and are classified as Level 2 assets.\nCorporate and Government Bonds\nCorporate and government bonds are classified as Level 2 assets, as they are either valued at quoted market prices from observable pricing sources at the reporting date or valued based upon comparable securities with similar yields and credit ratings.\nFixed Income Pooled Funds\nFixed income pooled funds are classified as Level 2 assets, as they are valued at the NAV of the shares held at year end, which is determined by the fund manager based on quoted market pricing from observable pricing sources at the reporting date or valued based upon comparable securities with similar yields, credit ratings, or factors. Fixed income pooled funds may hold government bonds, index linked bonds, corporate bonds, cash and derivative instruments.\nOther Pooled Funds\nOther pooled funds are classified as Level 2 assets, as they are valued at the NAV of the shares held at year end, which is based on the fair value of the underlying investments.\nInsurance Contracts\nInsurance contracts are classified as Level 3 assets, as they are carried at contract value, which approximates the estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is based on the fair value of the underlying investment of the insurance company and discount rates that require inputs with limited observability.\nContributions and Projected Benefit Payments\nPension contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans for fiscal year 2021 were $\n44.6\n. Contributions for funded plans resulted primarily from contractual and regulatory requirements. Benefit payments to unfunded plans were due primarily to the timing of retirements. We anticipate contributing $\n40\nto $\n50\nto the defined benefit pension plans in fiscal year 2022. These contributions are anticipated to be driven primarily by contractual and regulatory requirements for funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon timing of retirements.\nProjected benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are as follows:\nThese estimated benefit payments are based on assumptions about future events. Actual benefit payments may vary significantly from these estimates.\n90\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe maintain a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (\"ESOP\") which forms part of the Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (\"RSP\"). The ESOP was established in May of 2002. The balance of the RSP is a qualified defined contribution plan including a 401(k) elective deferral component. A substantial portion of U.S. employees are eligible and participate.\nWe treat dividends paid on ESOP shares as ordinary dividends. Under existing tax law, we may deduct dividends which are paid with respect to shares held by the plan. Shares of our common stock in the ESOP totaled\n1,941,938\nas of 30 September 2021.\nOur contributions to the RSP include a Company core contribution for certain eligible employees who do not receive their primary retirement benefit from the defined benefit pension plans, with the core contribution based on a percentage of pay that is dependent on years of service. For the RSP, we also make matching contributions on overall employee contributions as a percentage of the employee contribution and include an enhanced contribution for certain eligible employees that do not participate in the defined benefit pension plans. Worldwide contributions expensed to income in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $\n53.3\n, $\n45.6\n, and $\n40.6\n, respectively.\nOther Postretirement Benefits\nWe provide other postretirement benefits consisting primarily of healthcare benefits to certain U.S. retirees who meet age and service requirements. The healthcare benefit is a continued medical benefit until the retiree reaches age 65. Healthcare benefits are contributory, with contributions adjusted periodically. The retiree medical costs are capped at a specified dollar amount, with the retiree contributing the remainder. The cost of these benefits was not material in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019. Accumulated postretirement benefit obligations as of the end of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were $\n27.4\nand $\n38.6\n, respectively, of which $\n5.5\nand $\n7.2\nwere current obligations, respectively.\nWe recognize changes in other postretirement benefit plan obligations in other comprehensive income on a pretax basis. In fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we recognized gains that arose during the period of $\n5.4\nand $\n1.3\n, respectively. There was $\n1.8\nnet actuarial gain amortization in fiscal year 2021 and\nno\nactuarial gain amortization in 2020 as the corridor for the plan was not exceeded.\nThe net actuarial gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss on a pretax basis was $\n6.6\nand $\n3.0\nas of 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n16.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLitigation\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings, including commercial, competition, environmental, intellectual property, regulatory, product liability, and insurance matters. We do not currently believe there are any legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, that are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn September 2010, the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense (\"CADE\") issued a decision against our Brazilian subsidiary, Air Products Brasil Ltda., and several other Brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities. CADE imposed a civil fine of R$\n179.2\nmillion (approximately $\n33\nat 30 September 2021) on Air Products Brasil Ltda. This fine was based on a recommendation by a unit of the Brazilian Ministry of Justice, following an investigation beginning in 2003, which alleged violation of competition laws with respect to the sale of industrial and medical gases. The fines are based on a percentage of our total revenue in Brazil in 2003.\nWe have denied the allegations made by the authorities and filed an appeal in October 2010 with the Brazilian courts. On 6 May 2014, our appeal was granted and the fine against Air Products Brasil Ltda. was dismissed. CADE has appealed that ruling and the matter remains pending. We, with advice of our outside legal counsel, have assessed the status of this matter and have concluded that, although an adverse final judgment after exhausting all appeals is possible, such a judgment is not probable. As a result,\nno\nprovision has been made in the consolidated financial statements. In the event of an adverse final judgment, we estimate the maximum possible loss to be the full amount of the fine of R$\n179.2\nmillion (approximately $\n33\nat 30 September 2021) plus interest accrued thereon until final disposition of the proceedings.\n91\nAdditionally, Winter Storm Uri, a severe winter weather storm in the U.S. Gulf Coast in February 2021, disrupted our operations and caused power and natural gas prices to spike significantly in Texas. We are currently in the early stages of litigation of a dispute regarding energy management services related to the impact of this unusual event, and other disputes may arise from such power price increases. In addition, legislative action may affect power supply and energy management charges. While it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional costs related to power supply and energy management services in Texas related to the winter storm, it is too early to estimate potential losses, if any, given significant unknowns resulting from the unusual nature of this event.\nEnvironmental\nIn the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA,\" the federal Superfund law), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\"), and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Presently, there are\n31\nsites on which a final settlement has not been reached where we, along with others, have been designated a potentially responsible party by environmental authorities or are otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation, including cleanup activity at certain of our current and former manufacturing sites. We continually monitor these sites for which we have environmental exposure.\nAccruals for environmental loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The consolidated balance sheets at 30 September 2021 and 2020 included an accrual of $\n76.7\nand $\n84.7\n, respectively, primarily as part of other noncurrent liabilities. The environmental liabilities will be paid over a period of up to\n30 years\n. We estimate the exposure for environmental loss contingencies to range from $\n76\nto a reasonably possible upper exposure of $\n90\nas of 30 September 2021.\nActual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Using reasonably possible alternative assumptions of the exposure level could result in an increase to the environmental accrual. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to the reasonably possible upper exposure level could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, a different remediation alternative is identified, or a significant increase in our proportionate share occurs. We do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year.\nPace\nAt 30 September 2021, $\n39.8\nof the environmental accrual was related to the Pace facility.\nIn 2006, we sold our Amines business, which included operations at Pace, Florida, and recognized a liability for retained environmental obligations associated with remediation activities at Pace. We are required by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (\"FDEP\") and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"USEPA\") to continue our remediation efforts. We recognized a before-tax expense of $\n42\nin fiscal year 2006 in results from discontinued operations and recorded an environmental accrual of $\n42\nin continuing operations on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we completed an updated cost review of the environmental remediation status at the Pace facility. The review was completed in conjunction with requirements to maintain financial assurance per the Consent Order issued by the FDEP discussed below. Based on our review, we expect ongoing activities to continue for 30 years. Additionally, we will require near-term spending to install new groundwater recovery wells and ancillary equipment, in addition to future capital to consider the extended time horizon for remediation at the site. As a result of these changes, we increased our environmental accrual for this site by $\n19\nin continuing operations on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized a before-tax expense of $\n19\nin results from discontinued operations in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. There has been\nno\nchange to the estimated exposure range related to the Pace facility in fiscal year 2021.\n92\nWe have implemented many of the remedial corrective measures at the Pace facility required under 1995 Consent Orders issued by the FDEP and the USEPA. Contaminated soils have been bioremediated, and the treated soils have been secured in a lined on-site corrective action management unit. Several groundwater recovery systems have been installed to contain and remove contamination from groundwater. We completed an extensive assessment of the site to determine the efficacy of existing measures, what additional corrective measures may be needed, and whether newer remediation technologies that were not available in the 1990s might be suitable to more quickly and effectively remediate groundwater. Based on assessment results, we completed a focused feasibility study that has identified alternative approaches that may more effectively remove contaminants. We continue to review alternative remedial approaches with the FDEP and have started additional field work to support the design of an improved groundwater recovery network with the objective of targeting areas of higher contaminant concentration and avoiding areas of high groundwater iron which has proven to be a significant operability issue for the project. In the first quarter of 2015, we entered into a new Consent Order with the FDEP requiring us to continue our remediation efforts at the Pace facility, along with the completion of a cost review every 5 years. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we completed an updated cost review which resulted in a change in assumptions regarding future operating costs as discussed above.\nPiedmont\nAt 30 September 2021, $\n9.5\nof the environmental accrual was related to the Piedmont site.\nOn 30 June 2008, we sold our Elkton, Maryland, and Piedmont, South Carolina, production facilities and the related North American atmospheric emulsions and global pressure sensitive adhesives businesses. In connection with the sale, we recognized a liability for retained environmental obligations associated with remediation activities at the Piedmont site. This site is under active remediation for contamination caused by an insolvent prior owner.\nWe are required by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (\"SCDHEC\") to address both contaminated soil and groundwater. Numerous areas of soil contamination have been addressed, and contaminated groundwater is being recovered and treated. The SCDHEC issued its final approval to the site-wide feasibility study on 13 June 2017 and the Record of Decision for the site on 27 June 2018, after which we signed a Consent Agreement Amendment memorializing our obligations to complete the cleanup of the site. Remediation has started in accordance with the design, which includes in-situ chemical oxidation treatment, as well as the installation of a soil vapor extraction system to remove volatile organic compounds from the unsaturated soils beneath the impacted areas of the plant. We estimate that source area remediation and groundwater recovery and treatment will continue through 2029. Thereafter, we expect this site to go into a state of monitored natural attenuation through 2047.\nWe recognized a before-tax expense of $\n24\nin 2008 as a component of income from discontinued operations and recorded an environmental liability of $\n24\nin continuing operations on the consolidated balance sheets. There have been no significant changes to the estimated exposure.\nPasadena\nAt 30 September 2021, $\n11.2\nof the environmental accrual was related to the Pasadena site.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2012, management committed to permanently shutting down our polyurethane intermediates (\"PUI\") production facility in Pasadena, Texas. In shutting down and dismantling the facility, we have undertaken certain obligations related to soil and groundwater contaminants. We have been pumping and treating groundwater to control off-site contaminant migration in compliance with regulatory requirements and under the approval of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (\"TCEQ\"). We estimate that the pump and treat system will continue to operate until 2042.\nWe plan to perform additional work to address other environmental obligations at the site. This additional work includes remediating, as required, impacted soils, investigating groundwater west of the former PUI facility, performing post closure care for two closed RCRA surface impoundment units, establishing engineering controls, and performing a pilot study to treat impacted soils. In 2012, we estimated the total exposure at this site to be $\n13\n. There have been no significant changes to the estimated exposure.\n93\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOur asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with long-term on-site supply contracts under which we have built a facility on land owned by the customer and are obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. The retirement of assets includes the contractually required removal of a long-lived asset from service and encompasses the sale, removal, abandonment, recycling, or disposal of the assets as required at the end of the contract term. These obligations are primarily reflected within \"Other noncurrent liabilities\" on the consolidated balance sheets. The timing and/or method of settlement of these obligations are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within our control.\nChanges to the carrying amount of our asset retirement obligations were as follows:\nWarranties and Guarantees\nWe do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with warranties and guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations.\nWarranties\nWe, in the normal course of business operations, have issued product warranties related to equipment sales. Also, contracts often contain standard terms and conditions which typically include a warranty and indemnification to the buyer that the goods and services purchased do not infringe on third-party intellectual property rights. The provision for estimated future costs relating to warranties is not material to the consolidated financial statements.\nGuarantees\nTo date,\nno\nequity contributions or payments have been made since the inception of the guarantees discussed below. The fair value of these guarantees is not material.\nWe are party to an equity support agreement and operations guarantee related to an air separation facility constructed in Trinidad for a venture in which we own\n50\n%. At 30 September 2021, maximum potential payments under joint and several guarantees were $\n24.0\n. Exposures under the guarantees decline over time and will be completely extinguished by 2024.\nWe guaranteed the repayment of our\n25\n% share of an equity bridge loan that has been provided to fund equity commitments to the Jazan Gas Project Company joint venture with ACWA Holding in Saudi Arabia. ACWA also guarantees their share of the loan. As of 30 September 2021, our maximum exposure under the guarantee was approximately $\n100\n, and payables and accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets included $\n94.4\nfor our obligation to make equity contributions.\nWe also have a long-term sale of equipment contract with the joint venture to engineer, procure, and construct the industrial gas facilities that will supply gases to Aramco. We provided bank guarantees to the joint venture to support our performance under the contract. As of 30 September 2021, our maximum potential payments were\n$\n247\n.\n94\nSubsequent Event\nAs part of the Jazan Integrated Gasification and Power Company transaction discussed in Note 24,\nSubsequent Events\n, Jazan Gas Project Company sold its air separation units to Aramco in October 2021 and repaid its outstanding debt, including the equity bridge loan. Our bank guarantees that support performance under the sale of equipment contract remain in place.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nWe are obligated to make future payments under unconditional purchase obligations as summarized below:\nApproximately $\n8.3\nbillion of our unconditional purchase obligations relate to helium and rare gases. The majority of these obligations occur after fiscal year 2026. Helium purchases include crude feedstock supply to helium refining plants in North America as well as refined helium purchases from sources around the world. As a rare byproduct of natural gas production in the energy sector, these helium sourcing agreements are medium- to long-term and contain take-if-tendered provisions. The refined helium is distributed globally and sold as a merchant gas, primarily under medium-term requirements contracts. While contract terms in our helium sourcing contracts are generally longer than our customer sales contracts, helium is a rare gas used in applications with few or no substitutions because of its unique physical and chemical properties.\nWe estimate our maximum obligation for future purchases of plant and equipment to be approximately $\n1.0\nbillion based on open purchase orders as of 30 September 2021. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to reschedule, cancel, or otherwise modify based on our business needs. We have disclosed this obligation in fiscal year 2022; however, timing of actual satisfaction of the obligation may vary.\nOur unconditional purchase obligations also include commitments for power and natural gas supply as well as feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. Our long-term sales contracts to customers are generally matched to the term of these obligations and provide recovery of price increases. As a result, we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\n95\n17.\nCAPITAL STOCK\nCommon Stock\nAuthorized common stock consists of\n300\nmillion shares with a par value of $\n1\nper share. As of 30 September 2021,\n249\nmillion shares were issued, with\n221\nmillion outstanding.\nOn 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $\n1.0\nbillion of our outstanding common stock. We repurchase shares pursuant to Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, through repurchase agreements established with several brokers. We did\nno\nt purchase any of our outstanding shares during fiscal year 2021. At 30 September 2021, $\n485.3\nin share repurchase authorization remains.\nA summary of the changes in common shares in fiscal year 2021 is presented below:\nPreferred Stock\nAuthorized preferred stock consisted of\n25\nmillion shares with a par value of $\n1\nper share, of which\n2.5\nmillion were designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. There were\nno\npreferred shares issued or outstanding as of 30 September 2021 and 2020.\n18.\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nOur outstanding share-based compensation programs include deferred stock units and stock options. During the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021, we granted market-based and time-based deferred stock units. We have not issued stock option awards since fiscal year 2015. The terms of our share-based awards are fixed at the grant date. We issue shares from treasury stock upon payout of deferred stock units and exercise of stock options.\nAt the annual shareholders meeting held on 28 January 2021, the shareholders approved a new Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"LTIP\"), which has an authorized pool of 1,500,000 shares available for future grant, plus additional shares underlying awards outstanding on the date the LTIP was adopted but that are not issued. As of 30 September 2021, there were\n1,566,433\nshares available for future grant under our LTIP.\nShare-based compensation cost recognized on the consolidated income statements is summarized below:\nBefore-tax share-based compensation cost relates to deferred stock units and is primarily included in \"Selling and administrative\" on our consolidated income statements. The amount of share-based compensation cost capitalized in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was not material.\n96\nDeferred Stock Units\nWe have granted deferred stock units to executives, selected employees, and outside directors. These deferred stock units entitle the recipient to one share of common stock upon vesting, which is conditioned, for employee recipients, on continued employment during the deferral period and may be conditioned on achieving certain performance targets. We grant deferred stock unit awards with a\ntwo\n- to\nfive-year\ndeferral period that is subject to payout upon death, disability, or retirement. Deferred stock units issued to outside directors are paid after service on the Board of Directors ends at the time elected by the director (not to exceed\n10\nyears after service ends). We generally expense the grant-date fair value of these awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period; however, expense recognition is accelerated for retirement eligible individuals who meet the requirements for vesting upon retirement. We have elected to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than to estimate them. Forfeitures have not been significant historically.\nMarket-based deferred stock units vest as long as the employee continues to be employed by the Company and upon the achievement of the performance target. The performance target, which is approved by the Compensation Committee, is our share price appreciation and dividends paid, or \"total shareholder return,\" in relation to a defined peer group over a\nthree-year\nperformance period beginning 1 October of the fiscal year of grant. We granted\n77,251\n,\n80,215\n, and\n114,929\nmarket-based deferred stock units in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nThe fair value of market-based deferred stock units was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model as these equity awards are tied to a market condition. The model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the market condition stipulated in the grant and calculates the fair value of the awards. We generally expense the grant-date fair value of these awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The estimated grant-date fair value of market-based deferred stock units was $\n235.48\n, $\n275.19\n, and $\n229.61\nper unit in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nThe calculation of the fair value of these market-based deferred stock units used the following assumptions:\nIn addition, we granted\n110,555\ntime-based deferred stock units at a weighted average grant-date fair value of $\n282.48\n. In fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we granted\n123,448\nand\n169,666\ntime-based deferred stock units at a weighted average grant-date fair value of $\n230.92\nand $\n168.68\n, respectively.\nA summary of deferred stock unit activity in fiscal year 2021 is presented below:\nCash payments made for deferred stock units totaled $\n5.2\n, $\n4.8\n, and $\n1.9\nin fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of 30 September 2021, there was $\n47.0\nof unrecognized compensation cost related to deferred stock units. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.5\nyears. The total fair value of deferred stock units paid out during fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, including shares vested in prior periods, was $\n88.0\n, $\n65.4\n, and $\n19.2\n, respectively.\n97\nStock Options\nWe have granted awards of options to purchase common stock to executives and selected employees. The exercise price of stock options equals the market price of our stock on the date of the grant. Options generally vest incrementally over\nthree years\nand remain exercisable for\nten years\nfrom the date of grant. As of 30 September 2021, there was no unrecognized compensation cost as all stock option awards were fully vested.\nA summary of stock option activity in fiscal year 2021 is presented below:\nThe weighted average remaining contractual term of stock options outstanding and exercisable at 30 September 2021 was\n1.9\nyears. The aggregate intrinsic value of these stock options was $\n125\n, which represents the amount by which our closing stock price of $\n256.11\nas of 30 September 2021 exceeds the exercise price multiplied by the number of in-the-money options outstanding or exercisable. The intrinsic value of stock options exercised during fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $\n29.0\n, $\n65.7\n, and $\n87.2\n, respectively.\nCompensation cost is generally recognized over the stated vesting period consistent with the terms of the arrangement, which is either on a straight-line or graded-vesting basis. Expense recognition is accelerated for retirement-eligible individuals who would meet the requirements for vesting of awards upon their retirement.\nCash received from option exercises during fiscal year 2021 was $\n10.6\n. The total tax benefit realized from stock option exercises in fiscal year 2021 was $\n6.8\n, of which $\n6.5\nwas the excess tax benefit.\n19.\nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\nThe table below summarizes changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss (\"AOCL\"), net of tax, attributable to Air Products:\n98\nThe table below summarizes the reclassifications out of AOCL and the affected line item on the consolidated income statements:\n(A)\nThe fiscal years 2021 and 2020 impacts include amortization of the excluded component and the effective portion of the related hedges.\n(B)\nThe fiscal year 2019 impact relates to a net gain on the exchange of two equity affiliates with a joint venture partner. Refer to Note 3,\nAcquisitions\n, for additional information.\n(C)\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost reclassified out of AOCL include items such as prior service cost amortization, actuarial loss amortization, and settlements and are included in “Other non-operating income (expense), net” on the consolidated income statements. Refer to Note 15,\nRetirement Benefits\n, for additional information.\n20.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe table below details the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\"):\n*EPS is calculated independently for each component and may not sum to total EPS due to rounding.\n99\nDiluted EPS attributable to Air Products reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options or other share-based awards were exercised or converted into common stock. The dilutive effect is computed using the treasury stock method, which assumes all share-based awards are exercised, and the hypothetical proceeds from exercise are used by the Company to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. To the extent they would have been dilutive, the incremental shares, or the difference between shares assumed to be issued versus purchased, are included in the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation. There were\nno\nantidilutive outstanding share-based awards in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n21.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe table below summarizes income from U.S. and foreign operations before taxes:\nThe table below details the components of our income tax provision:\nCash Paid for Taxes (Net of Cash Refunds)\nIncome tax payments, net of refunds, were $\n383.8\n, $\n379.9\n, and $\n324.3\nin fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Fiscal year 2021 reflects an income tax refund of $\n6.7\nthat is related to cash provided by discontinued operations.\n100\nIndia Finance Act 2020\nOn 27 March 2020, the Indian government passed Finance Act 2020 (the \"India Finance Act\"), which amended rules regarding the taxation of dividends declared and distributed by Indian companies. Under the India Finance Act, future dividends declared or distributed by an Indian company are no longer subject to dividend distribution tax. Instead, any non-resident recipient is subject to a withholding tax. Our income tax provision for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020 reflected an expense of $\n20.3\nfor estimated withholding taxes that we may incur on future dividends related to INOX Air Products Private Limited (\"INOX\"), an equity affiliate investment in our Industrial Gases – Asia segment. Additionally, we recorded a benefit of $\n33.8\nwithin \"Equity affiliates' income\" for our share of accumulated dividend distribution taxes released with respect to INOX.\nU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn 22 December 2017, the United States enacted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act” or \"Tax Reform\"), which significantly changed existing U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to\n21\n%, a deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings, as well as other changes. Our consolidated income statements reflect a discrete net income tax expense of $\n43.8\nin fiscal year 2019 related to impacts of the Tax Act. The net expense included the reversal of a non-recurring $\n56.2\nbenefit initially recorded in fiscal year 2018 related to the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends, which was eliminated by regulations issued in fiscal year 2019. The reversal in 2019 was partially offset by a benefit of $\n12.4\nto reduce the total expected costs of the deemed repatriation tax.\nAs of 30 September 2021, the remaining liability for the deemed repatriation tax is $\n177.7\n, $\n157.1\nof which is presented within noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We are paying this obligation in installments over\nfive\nremaining years.\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes.\nA reconciliation of the differences between the United States federal statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate is provided below:\nForeign tax differentials represent the differences between foreign earnings subject to foreign tax rates that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate and include tax holidays and incentives. Our income tax holidays relate to operations in jurisdictions that provide reduced income tax rates for certain qualifying activities and are conditional upon us meeting certain operating thresholds. The impact of these tax holidays decreased income tax expense by $\n26.9\n($\n0.12\nper share) in fiscal year 2020, primarily related to a preferential tax rate in China that is effective until 31 December 2030. This includes the impact of remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities in 2020 due to an extension of the holiday period in China. The impact of tax holidays in fiscal years 2021 and 2019 was not material.\nTax on foreign repatriated earnings includes benefits and costs related to U.S. and foreign taxation on the current and future repatriation of foreign earnings and a U.S. benefit for related foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate in 2020 reflects impacts from the India Finance Act 2020 discussed above. In addition, the Tax Act included new provisions related to the taxation of foreign operations, known as Global Intangible Low Tax Income (“GILTI”). We have elected as an accounting policy to account for GILTI as a period cost when incurred.\nShare-based compensation reflects the impact from recognition of $\n17.0\n, $\n20.0\n, and $\n14.6\nof excess tax benefits in our provision for income taxes during fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n101\nIn fiscal year 2021, other includes net tax benefits of $\n21.5\n, including interest, resulting from the release of U.S. unrecognized tax benefits upon expiration of the statute of limitations on uncertain tax positions taken in prior years.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nThe significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are included within the consolidated balance sheets as follows:\nDeferred tax liabilities related to plant and equipment increased due to the impact of accelerated tax depreciation deductions in excess of book depreciation primarily in the United States. Deferred tax assets related to retirement benefits and compensation accruals are impacted by changes in plan assets and benefit obligations that have been recognized in other comprehensive income. This balance decreased primarily due to higher than expected asset returns and higher discount rates. Deferred tax assets related to tax credits and other tax carryforwards decreased primarily due to the utilization of tax credits against our income tax liabilities.\nAs of 30 September 2021, we had the following deferred tax assets for certain tax credits:\nOf the $\n27.5\nforeign tax credits, $\n14.2\nhave indefinite carryforward periods.\n102\nAs of 30 September 2021, we had the following loss carryforwards:\nOf the $\n258.8\nof foreign net operating loss carryforwards, $\n111.5\nhave indefinite carryforward periods.\nThe valuation allowance was $\n97.6\nand $\n95.0\nas of 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of 30 September 2021, the balance primarily related to $\n35.1\nof foreign credits and loss carryforwards as well as $\n55.4\nrelated to foreign capital losses that were generated from the loss recorded on the exit from the Energy-from-Waste project in 2016. If events warrant the reversal of the valuation allowance, it would result in a reduction of tax expense. We believe it is more likely than not that future earnings and reversal of deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to utilize our deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowance, as of 30 September 2021.\nWe record income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures unless those earnings are indefinitely reinvested. Such earnings may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes. The cumulative undistributed earnings that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures are included in retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheets and amounted to $\n5.9\nbillion as of 30 September 2021. An estimated $\n540.4\nin additional foreign withholding and other income taxes would be due if these earnings were remitted as dividends.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, is as follows:\nOf our unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 September 2021, $\n73.7\nwould impact the effective tax rate from continuing operations if recognized.\nIn fiscal year 2021, reserves for unrecognized tax benefits decreased $\n104.6\ndue to statute of limitation expirations. We released reserves of $\n65.6\nrelated to the sale of our former Performance Materials Division (“PMD”), $\n8.2\nassociated with our former Energy-from-Waste business (“EfW”), and $\n27.5\nfor other reserves, including those associated with a tax election benefit related to a non-U.S. subsidiary in 2017. Upon release of the reserves related to PMD and EfW, we recorded income tax benefits of $\n51.8\nand $\n8.2\n, respectively, as a component of discontinued operations. The PMD reserve was net of related deferred tax assets of $\n13.8\n. The release of other reserves of $\n27.5\nwas net of related deferred tax assets of $\n8.4\nand resulted in an income tax benefit, including interest, of $\n21.5\n.\nInterest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as a component of income tax expense and totaled ($\n0.2\n), $\n6.1\n, and $\n12.0\nin fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our 2021 expense reflects a benefit from the reversal of accrued interest on reserves released during the period. Our accrued balance for interest and penalties was $\n24.9\nand $\n25.2\nas of 30 September 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n103\nIncome Tax Examinations\nWe are currently under examination in a number of tax jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that a change in our unrecognized tax benefits may occur in fiscal year 2022 if any of these examinations are resolved during the next twelve months. However, quantification of an estimated range cannot be made as of the date of this report.\nWe generally remain subject to examination in the following major tax jurisdictions for the years indicated below:\n22.\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\n104\nRelated Party Transactions\nOur consolidated income statements include sales to some of our equity affiliates and joint venture partners as well as other income primarily from fees charged for use of Air Products' patents and technology. Sales to and other income from related parties totaled approximately $\n225\n, $\n335\n, and $\n410\nfor the fiscal years ended 30 September 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Sales agreements with related parties include terms that are consistent with those that we believe would have been negotiated at an arm’s length with an independent party. As of 30 September 2021 and 2020, our consolidated balance sheets included related party trade receivables of approximately $\n90\nand $\n95\n, respectively.\nIn addition, refer to Note 14,\nDebt\n, for information concerning debt owed to related parties.\nFacility Closures\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we recorded a charge of $\n23.2\nprimarily for a noncash write-down of assets associated with a contract termination in the Industrial Gases – Americas segment. This charge is reflected as \"Facility closure\" on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021 and was not recorded in segment results.\nIn December 2018, one of our customers was subject to a government enforced shutdown due to environmental reasons. As a result, we recognized a charge of $\n29.0\nduring the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 primarily related to the write-off of onsite assets. This charge was reflected as “Facility closure” on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2019 and was not recorded in segment results.\n105\nCompany Headquarters Relocation Income (Expense)\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we sold property at our former corporate headquarters located in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania, in anticipation of relocating our U.S. headquarters. We received net proceeds of $\n44.1\nand recorded a gain of $\n33.8\n, which is reflected on our consolidated income statements as \"Company headquarters relocation income (expense)\" for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2020. The gain was not recorded in the results of the Corporate and other segment.\nCost Reduction Actions\nIn fiscal year 2019, we recognized an expense of $\n25.5\nfor severance and other benefits associated with position eliminations. These actions were taken to drive cost synergies primarily within the Industrial Gases – EMEA and the Industrial Gases – Americas segments. The charge is reflected on our consolidated income statements as \"Cost reduction actions\" for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2019 and was not recorded in segment results\n.\n23.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION\nOur reporting segments reflect the manner in which our chief operating decision maker reviews results and allocates resources. Except in the Industrial Gases – EMEA and Corporate and other segments, each reporting segment meets the definition of an operating segment and does not include the aggregation of multiple operating segments. Our Industrial Gases – EMEA and Corporate and other segments each include the aggregation of two operating segments that meet the aggregation criteria under GAAP.\nAs of 30 September 2021, our reporting segments are:\n•\nIndustrial Gases – Americas;\n•\nIndustrial Gases – EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa);\n•\nIndustrial Gases – Asia;\n•\nIndustrial Gases – Global; and\n•\nCorporate and other\nOn 4 November 2021, we announced the reorganization of our industrial gases segments effective 1 October 2021. Refer to Note 24,\nSubsequent Events\n, for additional information.\nIndustrial Gases – Regional\nThe regional Industrial Gases segments (Americas, EMEA, and Asia) include the results of our regional industrial gas businesses, which produce and sell atmospheric gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and argon; process gases, such as hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n), carbon monoxide, and syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide); and specialty gases. The industrial gases business also develops, builds, and operates equipment for the production or processing of gases, such as air separation units and non-cryogenic generators.\nWe supply gases to diversified customers in many industries, including those in refining, chemical, gasification, metals, electronics, manufacturing, and food and beverage, through a variety of supply modes. For additional information, refer to Note 4,\nRevenue Recognition\n.\nElectricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases. Steam methane reformers utilize natural gas as the primary raw material, and gasifiers use liquid and solid hydrocarbons as the principal raw material for the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas. We mitigate energy, natural gas, and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas, surcharges, and cost pass-through and tolling arrangements.\nThe regional Industrial Gases segments also include our share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for by the equity method. The largest of these joint ventures operate in China, India, Italy, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Thailand.\nEach of the regional Industrial Gases segments competes against global industrial gas companies as well as regional competitors. Competition is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, and the development of industrial gas applications. We derive a competitive advantage in locations where we have pipeline networks, which enable us to provide reliable and economic supply of products to larger customers.\n106\nIndustrial Gases – Global\nThe Industrial Gases – Global segment includes activity related to the sale of cryogenic and gas processing equipment for air separation. The equipment is sold worldwide to customers in a variety of industries, including chemical and petrochemical manufacturing, oil and gas recovery and processing, and steel and primary metals processing. The Industrial Gases – Global segment also includes centralized global costs associated with management of all the Industrial Gases segments. These costs include Industrial Gases global administrative costs, product development costs, and research and development costs. We compete with a large number of firms for all the offerings included in the Industrial Gases – Global segment. Competition in the equipment business is based primarily on technological performance, service, technical know-how, price, and performance guarantees.\nCorporate and other\nThe Corporate and other segment includes our liquefied natural gas, turbo machinery equipment and services, and distribution sale of equipment businesses as well as our corporate support functions that benefit all segments. Competition for the sale of equipment businesses is based primarily on technological performance, service, technical know-how, price, and performance guarantees.\nThe results of the Corporate and other segment also include income and expense that is not directly associated with the other segments, such as foreign exchange gains and losses.\nIn addition to assets of the global businesses included in this segment, other assets include cash and cash items, short-term investments, deferred tax assets, and financial instruments.\nCustomers\nWe do not have a homogeneous customer base or end market, and no single customer accounts for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues.\nAccounting Policies\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1,\nMajor Accounting Policies\n. We evaluate the performance of segments based upon reported segment operating income.\n107\nBusiness Segment Information\n(A)\nThe sales information noted above relates to external customers only. All intersegment sales are eliminated in consolidation. Intersegment sales are generally transacted at market pricing. We generally do not have intersegment sales from our regional industrial gases businesses. Equipment manufactured for our regional industrial gases segments are generally transferred at cost and are not reflected as an intersegment sale.\n(B)\nRefer to the\nReconciliations to Consolidated Results\nsection below.\nReconciliations to Consolidated Results\nOperating Income\nThe table below reconciles total operating income disclosed in the table above to consolidated operating income as reflected on our consolidated income statements:\n108\nEquity Affiliates' Income\nThe table below reconciles total equity affiliates' income disclosed in the table above to consolidated equity affiliates' income as reflected on our consolidated income statements:\nGeographic Information\nSales to External Customers\n(A)\nLong-lived assets represents plant and equipment, net.\nGeographic information is based on country of origin.\n24.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nEquity Affiliate Investment in Jazan Integrated Gasification and Power Company (“JIGPC”)\nOn 27 October 2021, we made an initial investment of $\n1.6\nbillion in Jazan Integrated Gasification and Power Company (\"JIGPC\"). JIGPC is a joint venture with Saudi Aramco Power Company (a subsidiary of Aramco), ACWA Power, and Air Products Qudra in the Jazan Economic City, Saudi Arabia. Our investment, which was made primarily in the form of shareholder loans, represents a\n55\n% interest in the joint venture, of which\n4\n% is attributable to the non-controlling partner of Air Products Qudra. Our $\n1.6\nbillion investment includes approximately $\n130\nreceived from the non-controlling partner in September 2021. This cash receipt is reflected within “Investments by noncontrolling interests” on our consolidated statements of equity and cash flows for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021.\nWe expect to make an additional investment in JIGPC of approximately $\n1\nbillion in 2023.\nWe determined JIGPC is a variable interest entity for which we are not the primary beneficiary. Therefore, we will account for our investment in JIGPC under the equity method within the Industrial Gases – Middle East segment, a new reporting segment in fiscal year 2022 as discussed below.\nJIGPC Joint Venture\nOn 27 September 2021, JIGPC signed definitive agreements for the acquisition of $\n12\nbillion of assets from Aramco and related project financing for the purchase. JIGPC will complete the acquisition of the project assets, which include power blocks, gasifiers, air separation units, syngas cleanup assets, and utilities, in two phases. JIGPC will commission, operate, and maintain the project assets to supply electricity, steam, hydrogen and utilities to Aramco’s refinery and terminal complex under a\n25\n-year agreement.\n109\nThe first phase was completed on 27 October 2021 and included $\n7\nbillion of the assets. The second phase is expected to be funded and completed in 2023. JIGPC will account for the asset transfer as a financing, recording a financing receivable upon acquisition and recognizing financing income over the supply term.\nJazan Gas Project Company\nJazan Gas Project Company (“JGPC”), a joint venture between Air Products and ACWA Holding, entered into a\n20\n-year oxygen and nitrogen supply agreement in 2015 to supply Aramco’s oil refinery and power plant in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. Air Products owns\n26\n% of the joint venture. In October 2021, the supply agreement between JGPC and Aramco was terminated, and JGPC sold its air separation units to Aramco. We initially sold these assets to JGPC and deferred revenue and profit equal to our ownership percentage in the joint venture. With the termination of the supply agreement and sale of the air separation units complete, we will recognize the remaining deferred profit in equity affiliates’ income in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022.\nSegment Reorganization\nOn 4 November 2021, we announced the reorganization of our industrial gases segments. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we will report our results under the following five reporting segments:\n•\nIndustrial Gases – Americas;\n•\nIndustrial Gases – Asia;\n•\nIndustrial Gases – Europe;\n•\nIndustrial Gases – Middle East; and\n•\nCorporate and other\nThe reorganization reflects the separation of our former Industrial Gases – EMEA segment into two separate reporting segments: Industrial Gases – Europe and Industrial Gases – Middle East. The results of an affiliate formerly reflected in the Industrial Gases – Asia segment will now be reported in the Industrial Gases – Middle East segment. Additionally, the results of our Industrial Gases – Global operating segment will be reflected in the Corporate and other segment. Except for the Corporate and other segment, each reporting segment will meet the definition of an operating segment and will not include the aggregation of multiple operating segments. Our Corporate and other segment will include the aggregation of three operating segments that meet the aggregation criteria under GAAP.\nBeginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, segment results will be presented on a retrospective basis to reflect the reorganization.\n110"
