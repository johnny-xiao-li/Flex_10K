    "text": "Textron Inc. is a multi-industry company that leverages its global network of aircraft, defense, industrial and finance businesses to provide customers with innovative products and services around the world. References to “Textron Inc.,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise indicated, refer to Textron Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nWe conduct our business through five operating segments: Textron Aviation, Bell, Textron Systems and Industrial, which represent our manufacturing businesses, and Finance, which represents our captive finance business. Our segments include operations that are unincorporated divisions of Textron Inc. and others that are separately incorporated subsidiaries. Total revenues by segment and customer type for 2020 are presented below.\nThe following description of our business and operating segments should be read in conjunction with Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nTextron Aviation Segment\nTextron Aviation is a leader in general aviation. Textron Aviation manufactures, sells and services Beechcraft and Cessna aircraft, and services the Hawker brand of business jets. The segment has two principal product lines: aircraft and aftermarket parts and services. Aircraft includes sales of business jets, turboprop aircraft, military trainer and defense aircraft and piston engine aircraft.  Aftermarket parts and services includes commercial parts sales, and maintenance, inspection and repair services. Textron Aviation markets its products worldwide through its own sales force, as well as through a network of authorized independent sales representatives.\nThe family of jets currently offered by Textron Aviation includes the Citation M2, Citation CJ3+, Citation CJ4, Citation XLS+, Citation Latitude and the Citation Longitude. Textron Aviation’s turboprop aircraft include the Beechcraft King Air 260, King Air 360ER and King Air 360, and the Cessna Caravan and Grand Caravan EX. In addition, Textron Aviation’s military trainer and defense aircraft include the T-6 trainer, which has been used to train pilots from more than 20 countries, and the AT-6 light attack military aircraft. Textron Aviation also offers piston engine aircraft including the Beechcraft Baron and Bonanza, and the Cessna Skyhawk, Skylane, and the Turbo Stationair HD.\nIn support of its family of aircraft, Textron Aviation operates a global network of 20 service centers, two of which are co-located with Bell, along with more than 300 authorized independent service centers located throughout the world. Textron Aviation-owned service centers provide customers with 24-hour service and maintenance. Textron Aviation also provides its customers with around-the-clock parts support and offers a mobile support program with approximately 70 mobile service units. In addition, Able Aerospace Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Textron Aviation, provides component and maintenance, repair and overhaul services in support of commercial and military fixed- and rotor-wing aircraft.\nProduct Development Programs\nTextron Aviation is developing the Cessna Skycourier, a twin-engine, high-wing, large-utility turboprop aircraft, which achieved its first flight in May 2020. The Denali, a high-performance single engine turboprop aircraft under development, is expected to achieve its first flight in 2021.\n3\nBell Segment\nBell is one of the leading suppliers of military and commercial helicopters, tiltrotor aircraft, and related spare parts and services in the world.\nBell supplies advanced military helicopters and provides parts and support services to the U.S. Government and to military customers outside the United States. Bell’s primary U.S. Government programs are for the production and support of the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft and the H-1 helicopters. Bell is one of the leading suppliers of helicopters to the U.S. Government and, in association with The Boeing Company (Boeing), the only supplier of military tiltrotor aircraft. Tiltrotor aircraft are designed to provide the benefits of both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. Through its strategic alliance with Boeing, Bell produces and supports the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft primarily for the U.S. Department of Defense, and also offers this aircraft to other countries under the U.S. Government-sponsored foreign military sales program. The H-1 helicopter program includes a utility model, the UH-1Y, and an advanced attack model, the AH-1Z, which have 84% parts commonality between them. While the U.S. Marine Corps is the primary customer for H-1 helicopters, we also sell these helicopters under the U.S. Government-sponsored foreign military sales program.\nThrough its commercial business, Bell is a leading supplier of commercially certified helicopters and support to corporate, private, law enforcement, utility and emergency medical helicopter operators, and the U.S. and foreign governments.  Bell produces a variety of commercial aircraft types, including light single- and twin-engine helicopters and medium twin-engine helicopters, along with other related products. The commercial helicopters currently offered by Bell include the 429, 407GXi, 412EPX, 412EPI, 412EP, 505 Jet Ranger X and Huey II.\nFor both its military programs and its commercial products, Bell provides post-sale support and service for an installed base of approximately 13,000 helicopters through a network of six Company-operated service centers, four global parts distribution centers and nearly 100 independent service centers located in over 35 countries. Collectively, these service sites offer a complete range of logistics support, including parts, support equipment, technical data, training devices, pilot and maintenance training, component repair and overhaul, engine repair and overhaul, aircraft modifications, aircraft customizing, accessory manufacturing, contractor maintenance, field service and product support engineering.\nProduct Development Programs\nIn October 2019, Bell announced a new rotorcraft, the Bell 360 Invictus, which it is developing as its entrant for the U.S. Army's Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) Competitive Prototype Program, part of the U.S. government's Future Vertical Lift (FVL) family of programs. The FARA program was initiated by the U.S. Army to develop a successor to the retired Bell OH-58D Kiowa Warrior helicopter.  In March 2020, the U.S. Army selected the 360 Invictus to move to the second phase of the Competitive Prototype Program.\nBell continues its development and refinement of the V-280 Valor, a next generation vertical lift aircraft as part of the Joint Multi Role Technology Demonstrator (JMR-TD) initiative. The JMR-TD program is the science and technology precursor to the FVL program. The V-280 achieved its first flight in December 2017 and its first cruise mode flight in May 2018. In March 2020, the U.S. Army awarded Bell a Competitive Demonstration and Risk Reduction contract for the next stage of its Future Long Range Assault Aircraft program.\nBell’s first super medium commercial helicopter, the 525 Relentless, is currently in the certification process with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\nTextron Systems Segment\nTextron Systems is a supplier to the defense, aerospace and general aviation markets.

Sales are made through a combination of a network of independent distributors and dealers worldwide, the Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s retail outlets, which sell our products under the Tracker Off-Road brand, and factory direct resources.\nFinance Segment\nOur Finance segment, or the Finance group, is a commercial finance business that consists of Textron Financial Corporation (TFC) and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Finance segment provides financing primarily to purchasers of new and pre-owned Textron Aviation aircraft and Bell helicopters. A substantial number of the originations in our finance receivable portfolio are cross-border transactions for aircraft sold outside of the U.S.  In 2020 and 2019, our Finance group paid our Manufacturing group $195 million and $184 million, respectively, related to the sale of Textron-manufactured products to third parties that were financed by the Finance group.\nOur Finance segment’s largest business risk is the collectability of its finance receivable portfolio.  See Finance Segment section in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information about the Finance segment’s credit performance.\n5\nBacklog\nBacklog represents amounts allocated to contracts that we expect to recognize as revenue in future periods when we perform under the contracts. Backlog excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts, such as Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contracts.\nOur backlog at the end of 2020 and 2019 is summarized below:\nU.S. Government Contracts and Other Governmental Regulation\nOur operations, products and services are subject to various government regulations, including regulations related to U.S. government business, international regulation of aviation products and services, and environmental regulations.\nContracts with the U.S. Government, including contracts under the U.S. Government-sponsored foreign military sales program, generated approximately 30% of our consolidated revenues in 2020, primarily in our Bell and Textron Systems segments. We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. These laws and regulations, among other things, require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation; define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. Government contracts; and safeguard and restrict the use and dissemination of classified and  covered defense information and the exportation of certain products and technical data. New laws, regulations or procurement requirements, or changes to current ones, can significantly increase our costs, reducing our profitability.\nOur contracts with the U.S. Government generally may be terminated by the U.S. Government for convenience or if we default in whole or in part by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract. If the U.S. Government terminates a contract for convenience, we normally will be entitled to payment for the cost of contract work performed before the effective date of termination, including, if applicable, reasonable profit on such work, as well as reasonable termination costs. If, however, the U.S. Government terminates a contract for default, generally: (a) we will be paid the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted and services rendered, an agreed-upon amount for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of property, and an amount for partially completed products accepted by the U.S. Government; (b) the U.S. Government may not be liable for our costs with respect to unaccepted items and may be entitled to repayment of advance payments and progress payments related to the terminated portions of the contract; (c) the U.S. Government may not be liable for assets we own and utilize to provide services under the “fee-for-service” contracts; and (d) we may be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source. See Aerospace and Defense Industry section in Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information related to regulation of U.S. Government business herein.\nCommercial aircraft products manufactured by our Textron Aviation and Bell segments are required to comply with FAA regulations in the U.S. and the regulations of other similar aviation regulatory governing authorities internationally, including, the European Aviation Safety Agency. Maintenance facilities and aftermarket services must also comply with FAA and international regulations. These regulations address production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. For an aircraft to be manufactured and sold, the model must receive a type certificate from the appropriate aviation authority, and each aircraft must receive a certificate of airworthiness. Aircraft outfitting and completions also require approval by the appropriate aviation authority. See Strategic Risks section in Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information with respect to risks related to obtaining certification of new aircraft products.\nOur operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment. For additional information regarding environmental matters, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and Business and Operational Risks and Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters sections in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nBased on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, compliance with government regulations, including environmental regulations, has not had, and we do not expect it to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, laws and regulations may be changed or adopted that impose additional compliance requirements which could necessitate capital expenditures or otherwise increase our costs of doing business, reducing our profitability and negatively impacting our operating results.\n6\nHuman Capital Resources\nAt January 2, 2021, we employed approximately 33,000 employees worldwide, with approximately 75% located in the U.S. and the remainder located outside of the U.S. Approximately 6,800, or 28%, of our U.S. employees, most of whom work for our Bell and Textron Aviation segments, are represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements, and certain of our non-U.S. employees are represented by organized works councils. From time to time our collective bargaining agreements expire and come up for renegotiation.\nOur success is highly dependent upon our ability to maintain a workforce with the skills necessary for our businesses to succeed. We need highly skilled personnel in multiple areas including, among others, engineering, manufacturing, information technology, cybersecurity, flight operations, business development and strategy and management. In order to attract and retain highly skilled employees, we are committed to ensuring a safe and healthy work environment, offering comprehensive compensation and benefit programs, creating great career opportunities and building an engaging, inclusive environment where all employees are treated with dignity and respect.\nHealth and Safety\nTo maintain and enhance the safety of our employees, we promote a culture of continuous improvement and individual accountability to provide safe workplaces. We use an annual goal setting process to drive injury rate improvements, and the injury rate reduction goal is a performance metric that is reported to Textron’s Audit Committee and is tracked and reported to senior leadership.\nThe safety of our employees has been a priority throughout our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our enterprise-wide pandemic response teams, formed early in the pandemic, guided our operations in the processes and procedures to comply with applicable government-imposed health and safety-related operating restrictions, to enhance the safety of our facilities to protect the health of our employees and to monitor trends in infection rates at locations where we have facilities. These teams continue to operate, updating enterprise guidance as the pandemic has continued and the medical science and government guidance and orders have evolved. Our businesses continue to enforce COVID-19 health and safety protocols and have implemented protocols to address actual and suspected cases of COVID-19 and resulting contact tracing and quarantine requirements. Throughout the pandemic, we have been communicating regularly with our employees and monitoring their views on issues related to COVID-19 and the workplace as well as general levels of engagement through regular pulse surveys. In addition, management has regularly updated our Board of Directors on our COVID-19 status and response, including with respect to employee safety.\nTalent and Career Development\nOur talent development programs are designed to prepare our employees at all levels to take on new career and growth opportunities at Textron. Leadership, professional and functional training courses are tailored for employees at each stage of their careers and include a mix of enterprise-wide and business unit-specific programs. Textron University, an internal corporate function, provides (i) facilitated face-to-face professional and leadership development, (ii) web-based  general and specialized  functional and technical courses and (iii) an online portal to access advanced skills technical training, manage recertification of existing qualifications and other career planning tools and resources.\nThe current and future talent needs of each of our businesses are assessed annually through a formal talent review process which enables us to develop leadership succession plans and provide our employees with potential new career opportunities. In addition, leaders from functional areas within each business belong to enterprise-wide councils which conduct annual talent reviews. These processes enable us to fill talent needs by matching employees who are ready to assume significant leadership roles with opportunities that best fit their career path, which may be in other businesses within the enterprise.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nTextron is committed to having a diverse workforce and inclusive workplaces throughout our global operations. We believe by employing highly talented, diverse employees, who feel valued, respected and are able to contribute fully, we will improve performance, innovation and collaboration and drive talent retention, all of which contribute to stronger business results and reinforce our reputation as leaders in our industries and communities.\nFor over a decade, Textron has allocated five percent of annual incentive compensation for management-level employees toward achievement of diversity goals. Beginning in 2020, we focused these goals specifically on hiring diversity. To improve our outreach to diverse candidates, we have increased our recruiting efforts at historically black colleges and universities, enhanced our partnerships with diverse professional organizations and participated in diverse STEM conferences. In addition, we provide inclusion and unconscious bias training to our employees and recruiters to improve diversity in recruiting.\nFor discussion of certain risks relating to human capital management, see Risks Related to Human Capital section in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n7\nPatents and Trademarks\nWe own, or are licensed under, numerous patents throughout the world relating to products, services and methods of manufacturing. Patents developed while under contract with the U.S. Government may be subject to use by the U.S. Government. We also own or license active trademark registrations and pending trademark applications in the U.S. and in various foreign countries or regions, as well as trade names and service marks. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of our business, we do not believe that any existing patent, license, trademark or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material adverse effect on our business taken as a whole.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nThe following table sets forth certain information concerning our executive officers as of February 19, 2021.\nMr. Donnelly joined Textron in June 2008 as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and was promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer in January 2009.

    "text": "Our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks, including those discussed below, which may affect the value of our securities. The risks discussed below are those that we believe currently are the most significant to our business.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business is being adversely impacted, and is expected to continue to be adversely impacted, by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nOur businesses have experienced and continue to experience various degrees of disruption and reduced demand for certain of our products due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of COVID-19 have included and could continue to include disruption of the operation or temporary closure of certain of our facilities or the facilities of our\n9\ncustomers, suppliers or business partners as well as other disruptions in our supply chains. Challenges resulting from the pandemic have impacted, and may continue to impact, the ability of many of our employees to work effectively, due to illness, quarantines, facility closures, changes in manufacturing processes to accommodate social distancing guidelines, remote working arrangements, or other government-imposed operating restrictions. We have experienced and may continue to experience increased costs as a result of these business and production disruptions. Likewise, we have incurred and may continue to incur additional expenses related to implementing processes and procedures to comply with required operating restrictions and to enhance the safety of our facilities to protect the health of our employees.\nOur commercial businesses have been and may continue to be adversely impacted due to a general slowdown in demand for our general aviation products and services, recreational and other specialized vehicles and automotive products. We have experienced a decline in orders for our aviation products and services, as well as lower deliveries of commercial helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft because of reduced demand and travel restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic. Economic and other impacts from the pandemic may also result in future weak demand for our aviation and commercial helicopter products and services, the delay or cancellation of existing orders by our customers and lower flight hours, and consequently, lower demand for parts and maintenance. In addition, new regulations by U.S. or foreign governments and government agencies addressed to the aviation or travel industry could impose additional regulatory, aircraft security, travel restrictions or other requirements or restrictions related to the pandemic that could adversely impact demand for aircraft and rotorcraft or significantly reduce hours flown. As a result, our costs may further increase as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. These cost increases may not be fully recoverable, negatively impacting our profitability, and may continue even after the business environment has improved.\nIt is possible that the continued spread of COVID-19 and actions taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak could also further cause disruption in our supply chain or in the operations of our business partners, impacting their ability to perform their obligations, which could impact our ability to perform our contractual obligations; cause delay by, or limit the ability of, the U.S. Government and other customers to perform, including in making timely payments to us; and cause other unpredictable events. Limitations on government operations could impact regulatory approvals such as export licenses that are needed for international sales and deliveries. In addition, there may be changes in our U.S. and foreign government customers’ priorities as they confront competing budget priorities and more limited resources. These changes may impact current and future programs, government payments and other practices, procurements and funding decisions.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries. The resulting economic downturn, the severity and length of which cannot be predicted, may cause continued reduced demand for our products, delays or cancellations of customer orders, the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products, bankruptcies of our suppliers, customers or other business partners, adverse impact to investment performance of our pension plans and continued volatility in the global capital markets adversely impacting our access to capital. The extent to which the pandemic could impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity is highly uncertain and also will depend on future developments, most of which are outside our control. Such developments may include the geographic spread and duration of the virus, the severity of the disease, the development of treatments or vaccines, and the effects of actions that have been or may be taken by various governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the outbreak.\nSee also risks related to our Finance Segment under Financial Risks section below.\nAerospace and Defense Industry Risks\nDemand for our aircraft products is cyclical and lower demand adversely affects our financial results.\nDemand for business jets, turbo props and commercial helicopters has been cyclical and difficult to forecast. Unexpected events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely impacted demand for our aircraft products and may continue to do so.  Therefore, future demand for these products could be significantly and unexpectedly less than anticipated and/or less than previous period deliveries. Similarly, there is uncertainty as to when or whether our existing commercial backlog for aircraft products will convert to revenues as the conversion depends on production capacity, customer needs and credit availability. Changes in economic conditions has in the past caused, and in the future may cause, customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled, deferred or cancelled. Reduced demand for our aircraft products or delays or cancellations of orders previously has had and, in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have customer concentration with the U.S. Government; reduction in U.S. Government defense spending can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring 2020, we derived approximately 30% of our revenues from sales to a variety of U.S. Government entities.  Our revenues from the U.S. Government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various U.S. Government defense-related programs. The funding of these programs is subject to congressional appropriation decisions and the U.S. Government budget process which includes enacting relevant legislation, such as appropriations bills and accords on the debt ceiling. Although multiple-year contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis\n10\neven though a program may continue for several years. Consequently, programs often are only partially funded initially, and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. Further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the U.S. Government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as “continuing resolutions” rather than full-year appropriations. If we incur costs in advance or in excess of funds committed on a contract, we are at risk for non-reimbursement of those costs until additional funds are appropriated.  The reduction, termination or delay in the timing of funding for U.S. Government programs for which we currently provide or propose to provide products or services from time to time has resulted and, in the future, may result in a loss of anticipated revenues. A loss of such revenues could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Significant changes in national and international policies or priorities for defense spending, as well as the potential impact of sequestration, could affect the funding, or the timing of funding, of our programs, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, because our U.S. Government contracts generally require us to continue to perform even if the U.S. Government is unable to make timely payments, we may need to finance our continued performance for the impacted contracts from our other resources on an interim basis.  An extended delay in the timely payment by the U.S. Government could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nU.S. Government contracts can be terminated at any time and may contain other unfavorable provisions.\nThe U.S. Government typically can terminate or modify any of its contracts with us either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract. In the event of termination for the U.S. Government’s convenience, contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed. A termination arising out of our default for failure to perform could expose us to liability, including but not limited to, all costs incurred under the contract plus potential liability for re-procurement costs in excess of the total original contract amount, less the value of work performed and accepted by the customer under the contract. Such an event could also have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. If any of our contracts are terminated by the U.S. Government whether for convenience or default, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts. We also enter into “fee for service” contracts with the U.S. Government where we retain ownership of, and consequently the risk of loss on, aircraft and equipment supplied to perform under these contracts. Termination of these contracts could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. On contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor. In addition, in the event that the U.S. Government is unable to make timely payments, failure to continue contract performance places the contractor at risk of termination for default. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to procurement rules and regulations; our failure to comply with these rules and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nWe must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. These laws and regulations, among other things, require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiation, define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. Government contracts, and safeguard and restrict the use and dissemination of classified information, covered defense information, and the exportation of certain products and technical data. New laws, regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones (including, for example, regulations related to cybersecurity) can significantly increase our costs, reducing our profitability. Our failure to comply with procurement regulations and requirements could allow the U.S. Government to suspend or debar us from receiving new contracts for a period of time, reduce the value of existing contracts, issue modifications to a contract, withhold cash on contract payments, and control and potentially prohibit the export of our products, services and associated materials, any of which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. A number of our U.S. Government contracts contain provisions that require us to make disclosure to the Inspector General of the agency that is our customer if we have credible evidence that we have violated U.S. criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, or bribery; the U.S. civil False Claims Act; or received a significant overpayment under a U.S. Government contract. Failure to properly and timely make disclosures under these provisions may result in a termination for default or cause, suspension and/or debarment, and potential fines.\nAs a U.S. Government contractor, our businesses and systems are subject to audit and review by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA).\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the U.S. Government and its agencies such as the DCAA and DCMA. These agencies review our performance under contracts, our cost structure and our compliance with laws and regulations applicable to U.S. Government contractors. The systems that are subject to review include, but are not limited to, our accounting, estimating, material management and accounting, earned value management, purchasing and government property systems. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions that may include the termination of our contracts, forfeiture or reduction of profits, suspension or\n11\nreduction of payments, fines, and, under certain circumstances, suspension or debarment from future contracts for a period of time. Whether or not illegal activities are alleged, the U.S. Government also has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate.  These laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our government customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business.\nThe use of multi-award contracts by the U.S. Government increases competition, pricing pressure and cost.\nThe U.S. Government increasingly relies upon competitive contract award types, including indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity and multi-award contracts, which have the potential to create greater competition and increased pricing pressure, as well as to increase our cost by requiring that we submit multiple bids. In addition, multi-award contracts increase our cost as they require that we make sustained efforts to obtain task orders and delivery orders under the contract. Further, the competitive bidding process is costly and demands managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or may be split among competitors.\nOur profitability and cash flow varies depending on the mix of our government contracts and our ability to control costs\n.\nUnder fixed-price contracts, generally we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur, and, consequently, any costs in excess of the fixed price are absorbed by us. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates used in developing the pricing for such contracts can adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, fixed-price contracts generally require progress payments rather than performance-based payments which can delay our ability to recover a significant amount of costs incurred on a contract and thus affect the timing of our cash flows. Under fixed-price incentive contracts, we share with the U.S. Government cost underrun savings, which are derived from total cost being less than target costs; we also share in cost overruns, which occur when total costs exceed target costs up to a negotiated cost ceiling, but are solely responsible for costs above the ceiling. Under time and materials contracts, we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rates and for certain expenses. Under cost-reimbursement contracts that are subject to a contract-ceiling amount, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fee, which may be fixed or performance based, however, if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract or applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all such costs.  Due to the nature of our work under government contracts, we sometimes experience unforeseen technological difficulties and cost overruns. Under each type of contract, if we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Cost overruns also may adversely affect our ability to sustain existing programs and obtain future contract awards.\nStrategic Risks\nDeveloping new products and technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties.\nTo continue to grow our revenues and segment profit, we must successfully develop new products and technologies or modify our existing products and technologies for our current and future markets. Our future performance depends, in part, on our ability to identify emerging technological trends and customer requirements and to develop and maintain competitive products and services. Delays or cost overruns in the development and acceptance of new products or certification of new aircraft and other products occur from time to time and could adversely affect our results of operations. These delays could be caused by unanticipated technological hurdles, production changes to meet customer demands, unanticipated difficulties in obtaining required regulatory certifications of new aircraft or other products, coordination with joint venture partners or failure on the part of our suppliers to deliver components as agreed. We also could be adversely affected if our research and development efforts are less successful than expected or if we do not adequately protect the intellectual property developed through these efforts. Likewise, new products and technologies could generate unanticipated safety or other concerns resulting in expanded product liability risks, potential product recalls and other regulatory issues that could have an adverse impact on us. Furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing certain of our products to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. A reduction in capital spending in the aerospace or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for new products and technologies under development, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our investments in equipment or technology that we believe will enable us to obtain future service contracts for our U.S. Government or other customers may not result in contracts or revenues sufficient to offset such investment. The market for our product offerings does not always develop or continue to expand as we anticipate. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing technologies which gain superior market acceptance compared to our products.  A significant failure in our new product development efforts or the failure of our products or services to achieve market acceptance relative to our competitors’ products or services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n12\nWe have made and may continue to make acquisitions that increase the risks of our business.\nWe enter into acquisitions in an effort to expand our business and enhance shareholder value. Acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties that, in some cases, have resulted, and, in the future, could result in our not achieving expected benefits.  Such risks include difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner; challenges in achieving expected strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits; the risk that the acquired businesses’ markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the acquired businesses’ products and technologies do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets; the risk that our due diligence reviews of the acquired business do not identify or adequately assess all of the material issues which impact valuation of the business or result in costs or liabilities in excess of what we anticipated; the risk that we pay a purchase price that exceeds what the future results of operations would have merited; the risk that the acquired business may have significant internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions; and the potential loss of key customers, suppliers and employees of the acquired businesses.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nOur business could be negatively impacted by information technology disruptions and security threats.\nOur information technology (IT) and related systems are critical to the efficient operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day to day processes. From time to time, we update and/or replace IT systems used by our businesses.  The implementation of new systems can present temporary disruptions of business activities as existing processes are transitioned to the new systems, resulting in productivity issues, including delays in production, shipments or other business operations. We also outsource certain support functions, including certain global IT infrastructure services, to third-party service providers, and any disruption of such outsourced processes or functions could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  In addition, as a U.S. defense contractor, we face certain security threats, including threats to our IT infrastructure and unlawful attempts to gain access to our information via phishing / malware campaigns and other cyberattack methods, as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, as do our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and joint venture partners. Attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential, classified or otherwise proprietary information or that of our employees or customers, as well as other security breaches, are persistent, continue to evolve and require highly skilled IT resources.\nWe maintain Information Systems Incident Management Standards applicable to all our businesses intended to ensure information security events and weaknesses associated with information systems are communicated and acted on in a timely manner. Our enterprise risk management program includes cyber risk/network protection mitigation plans, and our disclosure controls and procedures address cybersecurity and include processes intended to ensure that security breaches are analyzed for potential disclosure. Additionally, we conduct periodic training for our employees regarding the protection of sensitive information which includes training intended to prevent the success of cyberattacks. Further, our insider trading compliance program addresses restrictions against trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information in connection with a cybersecurity incident.\nWhile we have experienced cybersecurity attacks, we have not suffered any material losses relating to such attacks, and we believe our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures are robust.  Due to the evolving nature of security threats, the possibility of future material incidents cannot be completely mitigated, and we may not always be successful in detecting, reporting or responding to cyber incidents. Future attacks or breaches of data security, whether of our systems or the systems of our service providers or other third parties who may have access to our data for business purposes, could disrupt our operations, cause the loss of business information or compromise confidential information, exposing us to liability or regulatory action. Such an incident also could require significant management attention and resources, increase costs that may not be covered by insurance, and result in reputational damage, potentially adversely affecting our competitiveness and our results of operations. Products and services that we provide to our customers may themselves be subject to cyberthreats which may not be detected or effectively mitigated, resulting in potential losses that could adversely affect us and our customers. In addition, our customers, including the U.S. Government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands.\nFailure to perform by our subcontractors or suppliers could adversely affect our performance.\nWe rely on other companies to provide raw materials, major components and subsystems for our products. Subcontractors also perform services that we provide to our customers in certain circumstances. We depend on these suppliers and subcontractors to meet our contractual obligations to our customers and conduct our operations. Our ability to meet our obligations to our customers could be adversely affected if suppliers or subcontractors do not provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in compliance with customer requirements and in a timely and cost-effective manner. Likewise, the quality of our products could be adversely impacted if companies to whom we delegate manufacture of major components or subsystems for our products, or from whom we acquire such items, do not provide components or subsystems which meet required specifications and perform to our and our customers’ expectations. Our suppliers may be less likely than us to be able to quickly recover from natural disasters and other events beyond their control and may be subject to additional risks such as financial problems that limit their ability to conduct their operations. The risk of these adverse effects would likely be greater in circumstances where we rely on only one or two subcontractors or suppliers for a particular raw material, product or service. In particular, in the aircraft\n13\nindustry, most vendor parts are certified by the regulatory agencies as part of the overall Type Certificate for the aircraft being produced by the manufacturer. If a vendor does not or cannot supply its parts, then the manufacturer’s production line may be stopped until the manufacturer can design, manufacture and certify a similar part itself or identify and certify another similar vendor’s part, resulting in significant delays in the completion of aircraft. Such events may adversely affect our financial results, damage our reputation and relationships with our customers, and result in regulatory actions and/or litigation.\nWe are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries that could adversely impact our business.\nDuring 2020, we derived approximately 32% of our revenues from international business, including U.S. exports. Conducting business internationally exposes us to additional risks than if we conducted our business solely within the U.S. We maintain manufacturing facilities, service centers, supply centers and other facilities worldwide, including in various emerging market countries.  Risks related to international operations include import, export, economic sanctions and other trade restrictions; changing U.S. and foreign procurement policies and practices; changes in international trade policies, including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials and renegotiation of free trade agreements; potential retaliatory tariffs imposed by foreign countries against U.S. goods; impacts related to the voluntary exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Brexit); restrictions on technology transfer; difficulties in protecting intellectual property; increasing complexity of employment and environmental, health and safety regulations; foreign investment laws; exchange controls; repatriation of earnings or cash settlement challenges; compliance with increasingly rigorous data privacy and protection laws; competition from foreign and multinational firms with home country advantages; economic and government instability, acts of terrorism and related safety concerns.  The impact of any one or more of these or other factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nAdditionally, some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific in-country purchases, technology transfers, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known as offsets, as a condition for a contract award. These contracts generally extend over several years and may include penalties if we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements which are often subjective. We also are exposed to risks associated with using foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and operations and teaming with international subcontractors and suppliers in connection with international programs. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we maintain policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, a violation of such laws by any of our international representatives, consultants, joint ventures, business partners, subcontractors or suppliers, even if prohibited by our policies, could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nNatural disasters or other events outside of our control may disrupt our operations, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and may not be fully covered by insurance.\nNatural disasters, including hurricanes, fires, tornados, floods and other forms of severe weather, the intensity and frequency of which are being exacerbated by climate change, other impacts of climate change, such as rising sea waters, as well as other events outside of our control including public health crises or pandemics, power outages and industrial accidents, have in the past and could in the future disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business. Any of these events could result in physical damage to and/or complete or partial closure of one or more of our facilities, temporary or long-term disruption of our operations or the operations of our suppliers by causing business interruptions or by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing or otherwise impacting our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide full protection for the costs that may arise from such events. The occurrence of any of these events could materially increase our costs and expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial Risks\nIf our Finance segment has difficulty collecting on its finance receivables, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nThe financial performance of our Finance segment depends on the quality of loans, leases and other assets in its portfolio. Portfolio quality can be adversely affected by several factors, including finance receivable underwriting procedures, collateral value, geographic or industry concentrations, and the effect of general economic conditions such as the recent deterioration of the economy due to the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has resulted in disruptions in the ability of many of our customers to conduct business effectively because of illness, quarantines, government shut-down orders, facility closures, reduced customer demand or other restrictions. As a result, our Finance segment has modified a significant number of the loans in its portfolio in order to provide temporary payment relief to its customers. In addition, the Finance segment has provided extended payment relief to certain customers. These modifications will delay our ultimate recovery on these assets. In addition, a substantial number of the originations in our finance receivable portfolio are cross-border transactions for aircraft sold outside of the U.S. Cross-border transactions present additional challenges and risks in the event of borrower default, which can result in difficulty or delay in collecting on the related finance receivables. Should current economic conditions persist or worsen, our\n14\nFinance segment may have difficulty successfully collecting on its finance receivable portfolio, and as a result our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe periodically need to obtain financing and such financing may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nWe periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due, to support our operations and/or to make acquisitions. Our access to the debt capital markets and the cost of borrowings are affected by a number of factors including market conditions and the strength of our credit ratings. If we cannot obtain adequate sources of credit on favorable terms, or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various non-U.S. jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the location of income among these different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore, changes to unrecognized tax benefits or changes in tax laws, which could affect our profitability. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income, as well as changes to applicable statutory tax rates. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters\nWe are subject to increasing compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results.\nAs a global business, we are subject to laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. International sales and global operations require importing and exporting goods, software and technology, some of which have military applications subjecting them to more stringent import-export controls across international borders on a regular basis. For example, we sometimes initially must obtain licenses and authorizations from various U.S. Government agencies before we are permitted to sell certain of our aerospace and defense products outside the U.S., and we are not always successful in obtaining these licenses or authorizations in a timely manner. Both U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to us have been increasing in scope and complexity. For example, both U.S. and foreign governments and government agencies regulate the aviation industry, and they have previously and may in the future impose new regulations for additional aircraft security or other requirements or restrictions, including, for example, restrictions and/or fees related to carbon emissions levels. Changes in environmental and climate change laws and regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to the necessity for new or additional investment in product designs or manufacturing processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures, including costs to defend regulatory reviews. New or changing laws and regulations or related interpretation and policies could increase our costs of doing business, affect how we conduct our operations, adversely impact demand for our products, and/or limit our ability to sell our products and services. Compliance with laws and regulations of increasing scope and complexity is even more challenging in our current business environment in which reducing our operating costs is often necessary to remain competitive. In addition, a violation of U.S. and/or foreign laws by one of our employees or business partners could subject us or our employees to civil or criminal penalties, including material monetary fines, or other adverse actions, such as denial of import or export privileges and/or debarment as a government contractor which could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business.\nCertain of our products are subject to laws regulating consumer products and could be subject to repurchase or recall as a result of safety issues.\nAs a distributor of consumer products in the U.S., certain of our products are subject to the Consumer Product Safety Act, which empowers the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous. Under certain circumstances, the CPSC could require us to repair, replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of our products, or potentially even discontinue entire product lines. We also may voluntarily take such action and, from time to time, have done so, but within strictures recommended by the CPSC. The CPSC also can impose fines or penalties on a manufacturer for non-compliance with its requirements. Furthermore, failure to timely notify the CPSC of a potential safety hazard can result in significant fines being assessed against us. Any repurchases or recalls of our products or an imposition of fines or penalties could be costly to us and could damage the reputation or the value of our brands. Additionally, laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states, as well as in other countries in which we sell our products, and more restrictive laws and regulations could be adopted in the future.\nIncreased regulation related to global climate change could negatively affect our business.\nIncreased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions. If environmental or climate change laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon our business or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.\n15\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and other claims.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business, including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions; government contracts; alleged lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations; production partners; product liability; patent and trademark infringement; employment disputes; and environmental, safety and health matters.  Due to the nature of our manufacturing business, we are regularly subject to liability claims arising from accidents involving our products, including claims for serious personal injuries or death caused by weather or by pilot, driver or user error. In the case of litigation matters for which reserves have not been established because the loss is not deemed probable, it is reasonably possible that such claims could be decided against us and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that are not presently estimable. In addition, we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate and that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial claims. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and costs in the future.  Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and we could incur judgments, receive adverse arbitration awards or enter into settlements for current or future claims that could adversely affect our results of operations in any particular period.\nIntellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers.\nIntellectual property infringement claims are, from time to time, asserted by third parties against us or our customers. Any related indemnification payments or legal costs we are obliged to pay on behalf of our businesses, our customers or other third parties can be costly.  Infringement claims also have resulted in legal restrictions on our businesses engaging in sales of allegedly infringing products. If such a restriction were imposed upon a material product line, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.  In addition, we own the rights to many patents, trademarks, brand names, trade names and trade secrets that are important to our business. The inability to enforce these intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, our intellectual property could be at risk due to cybersecurity threats.\nRisks Related to Human Capital\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to maintain a qualified workforce.\nOur success is highly dependent upon our ability to maintain a workforce with the skills necessary for our businesses to succeed. We need highly skilled personnel in multiple areas including, among others, engineering, manufacturing, information technology, cybersecurity, flight operations, business development and strategy and management.  From time to time we face challenges that may impact employee retention such as workforce reductions and facility consolidations and closures. In addition, some of our most experienced employees are retirement-eligible.  To the extent that we lose experienced personnel through retirement or otherwise, it is critical for us to develop other employees, hire new qualified employees and successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge.  Competition for skilled employees is intense, and we may incur higher labor, recruiting and/or training costs in order to attract and retain employees with the requisite skills. We may not be successful in hiring or retaining such employees which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect our results.\nOur results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by increasing costs and funding requirements related to our employee benefit plans. The obligation for our defined benefit pension plans is driven by, among other things, our assumptions of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate used for future payment obligations. Additionally, as part of our annual evaluation of these plans, significant changes in our assumptions, due to changes in economic, legislative and/or demographic experience or circumstances, or changes in our actual investment returns could negatively impact the funded status of our plans requiring us to substantially increase our pension liability with a resulting decrease in shareholders’ equity. Also, changes in pension legislation and regulations could increase the cost associated with our defined benefit pension plans.\nOur business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages and other labor issues.\nApproximately 6,800, or 28%, of our U.S. employees are unionized, and many of our non-U.S. employees are represented by organized councils. As a result, from time to time we experience work stoppages, which can negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis, resulting in strain on our relationships with our customers, loss or delay of revenues and/or increased cost. The presence of unions also may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive pressures in the marketplace. In addition, the workforces of many of our suppliers and customers are represented by labor unions. Work stoppages or strikes at the plants of our key suppliers could disrupt our manufacturing processes; similar actions at the plants of our customers could result in delayed or canceled orders for our products. Any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations."

    "text": "As previously reported in Textron’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 4, 2020, on August 22, 2019, a purported shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court in the Southern District of New York against Textron, its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer. The suit, filed by Building Trades Pension Fund of Western Pennsylvania, alleges that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements and concealing material adverse facts related to the Arctic Cat acquisition and integration. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages. On November 12, 2019, the Court appointed IWA Forest Industry Pension Fund (IWA) as the sole lead plaintiff in the case. On December 24, 2019, IWA filed an Amended Complaint in the now entitled\nIn re Textron Inc. Securities Litigation\n.  On February 14, 2020, IWA filed a Second Amended Complaint, and on March 6, 2020, Textron filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. On July 20, 2020, the Court granted Textron’s motion to dismiss and closed the case.  On August 18, 2020, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal contesting the dismissal, which Textron has opposed.  That appeal remains pending.\nAs previously reported in Textron’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, on February 7, 2012, a lawsuit was filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Ohio, Eastern Division (Akron) by Brian A. Bash, Chapter 7 Trustee for Fair Finance Company against Textron Financial Corporation (TFC), Fortress Credit Corp. and Fair Facility I, LLC. TFC provided a revolving line of credit of up to $17.5 million to Fair Finance Company from 2002 through 2007. The complaint alleges numerous counts against TFC, as Fair Finance Company’s working capital lender, including receipt of fraudulent transfers and assisting in fraud perpetrated on Fair Finance investors. The Trustee seeks avoidance and recovery of alleged fraudulent transfers in the amount of $316 million as well as damages of $223 million on the other claims. On November 9, 2012, the Court dismissed all claims against TFC. The trustee appealed, and on August 23, 2016, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal in part and remanded certain claims back to the trial court. On September 27, 2018, after reconsidering the remanded claims which were based upon civil conspiracy and intentional fraudulent transfer, the trial court granted partial summary judgment in favor of TFC, dismissing the Trustee’s civil conspiracy claim, as well as a portion of the Trustee’s claim for intentional fraudulent transfer, leaving only a portion of the intentional fraudulent transfer claim to be adjudicated.  A trial for this matter was held in February 2020, and on March 10, 2020, the jury returned a verdict in favor of TFC and against the Trustee. On the same day, the Court entered judgment in TFC's favor. On March 23, 2020, the Trustee filed a notice of appeal, which Textron has opposed. That appeal remains pending.\nWe also are subject to actual and threatened legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business, including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions; government contracts; alleged lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations; production partners; product liability; patent and trademark infringement; employment disputes; and environmental, health and safety matters. Some of these legal proceedings and claims seek damages, fines or penalties in substantial amounts or remediation of environmental contamination. As a government contractor, we are subject to audits, reviews and investigations to determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Under federal government procurement regulations, certain claims brought by the U.S. Government could result in our suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting for a period of time. On the basis of information presently available, we do not believe that existing proceedings and claims will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations."

    "text": "Overview\nDuring 2020, the global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, known as “COVID-19”, led to worldwide facility closures, workforce disruptions, supply chain destabilizations, reduced demand for many products and services, volatility in the capital markets and uncertainty in the economic outlook. Our operations experienced and continue to experience various degrees of disruption due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the pandemic. While some of our commercial manufacturing facilities had temporarily closed during the first quarter of 2020 through the latter part of the second quarter due to reduced demand for certain of our products, substantially all manufacturing activities had resumed in the third quarter. In the second half of the year, our commercial businesses have generally experienced an increase in customer demand compared with the first half of 2020.  However, demand has not returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, following the onset of the pandemic, we strengthened our cash position by issuing $650 million in senior debt and by borrowing $500 million under a new 364-Day Term Loan Credit Agreement. We also temporarily suspended share repurchases and took other measures to reduce costs and conserve cash, including employee furloughs at many of our commercial businesses and at corporate headquarters, reducing capital expenditures and delaying certain research and development projects. In the second quarter, we continued most of the measures taken in the first quarter to reduce costs and conserve cash and initiated a restructuring plan at certain of our businesses to further reduce costs. During the remainder of the year, we continued our focus on managing our businesses through the impacts of the pandemic while investing in future products and technologies.  Key financial highlights for 2020 include:\n•\nGenerated $833 million of net cash from operating activities from our manufacturing businesses.\n•\nMaintained a strong cash position with $2.3 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the year.\n•\nInvested $317 million in capital expenditures and $549 million in research and development projects.\n•\nRepurchased 4.1 million shares of our common stock.\nWhile we expect our commercial businesses, which have been adversely impacted by the pandemic, to slowly recover with the broader economic recovery, we cannot reasonably estimate when customer demand for our products and services may return to pre-pandemic levels.  There are many uncertainties regarding the pandemic, and we continue to closely monitor the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business, including how it is impacting our customers, employees, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional risks and uncertainties related to the pandemic’s impact on our business. The ultimate extent of the effects of the pandemic on the company and our consolidated financial position is uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the length and severity of the pandemic, and such effects could exist for an extended period of time, even after the pandemic ends.\nFor an overview of our business segments, including a discussion of our major products and services, refer to Item 1. Business. A discussion of our financial condition and operating results for 2020 compared with 2019 is provided below, while a discussion of 2019 compared with 2018 can be found in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 4, 2020. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n20\nRevenues\nRevenues decreased $2.0 billion, 15%, in 2020, compared with 2019. The revenue decrease included the following factors:\n•\nTextron Aviation revenues were lower\nby\n$1.2 billion,\nlargely\ndue\nto\nlower\nCitation\njet\nand\ncommercial\nturboprop\nvolume\nof $916 million, reflecting a decline in demand related to the pandemic, and lower aftermarket volume of $337 million, reflecting lower aircraft utilization resulting from the pandemic.\n•\nIndustrial revenues were lower by $798 million, largely due to lower volume in the Fuel Systems and Functional Components product line, primarily due to manufacturing facility closures in the first half of 2020, and lower volume and mix in the Specialized Vehicles product line, primarily reflecting a decline in demand related to the pandemic.\n•\nBell revenues were higher by $55 million, due to higher military revenues of $225 million, largely reflecting spares and  logistics support,  partially offset by lower commercial\nrevenues.\nCost of Sales and Selling and Administrative Expense\nCost of sales decreased $1.3 billion, 12%, in 2020, compared with 2019, largely due to lower net volume and mix described above. The decrease in cost of sales was partially offset by idle facility costs of $142 million, primarily at the Textron Aviation segment, reflecting unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs attributable to abnormally low production levels resulting from the pandemic and temporary manufacturing facility closures, and a $55 million inventory charge related to the TRU business discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Gross margin as a percentage of Manufacturing revenues decreased 290 basis points in 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to lower margin at the Textron Aviation segment reflecting unfavorable impacts from the pandemic, including the idle facility costs and inventory valuation charges.\nSelling and administrative expense decreased $107 million, 9%, in 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to cost reduction activities across our manufacturing segments, principally at the Textron Aviation and Industrial segments.\nSpecial Charges\nSpecial charges of $147 million and $72 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily include restructuring activities and intangible asset impairment charges as described in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nIncome Taxes\nIn 2020, the effective tax rate of (9.6)% was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to an audit settlement with respect to certain state income tax returns that resulted in a $52 million benefit and the favorable impact of research credits.  In 2019, the effective tax rate of 13.5% was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21%, primarily due to $61 million in benefits recognized for additional tax credits related to prior years as a result of the completion of a research and development tax credit analysis.\nFor a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nSegment Analysis\nWe operate in, and report financial information for, the following five business segments: Textron Aviation, Bell, Textron Systems, Industrial and Finance. Segment profit is an important measure used for evaluating performance and for decision-making purposes. Segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense, certain corporate expenses, gains/losses on major business dispositions, special charges and an inventory charge related to the 2020 COVID-19 restructuring plan, as discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The measurement for the Finance segment includes interest income and expense along with intercompany interest income and expense.  Operating expenses for the Manufacturing segments include cost of sales, selling and administrative expense and other non-service components of net periodic benefit cost/(credit), and exclude certain corporate expenses and special charges.\nIn our discussion of comparative results for the Manufacturing group, changes in revenues and segment profit for our commercial businesses typically are expressed in terms of volume and mix, pricing, foreign exchange, acquisitions and dispositions, inflation and performance. For revenues, volume and mix represents changes in revenues from increases or decreases in the number of units delivered or services provided and the composition of products and/or services sold.  For segment profit, volume and mix represents a change due to the number of units delivered or services provided and the composition of products and/or services\n21\nsold at different profit margins. Pricing represents changes in unit pricing. Foreign exchange is the change resulting from translating foreign-denominated amounts into U.S. dollars at exchange rates that are different from the prior period. Revenues generated by acquired businesses are reflected in Acquisitions for a twelve-month period, while reductions in revenues and segment profit from the sale of businesses are reflected as Dispositions. Inflation represents higher material, wages, benefits, pension service cost or other costs.  Performance reflects an increase or decrease in research and development, depreciation, selling and administrative costs, warranty, product liability, quality/scrap, labor efficiency, overhead, non-service pension cost/(credit), product line profitability, start-up, ramp up and cost-reduction initiatives or other manufacturing inputs.\nApproximately 30% of our 2020 revenues were derived from contracts with the U.S. Government, including those under the U.S. Government-sponsored foreign military sales program.  For our segments that contract with the U.S. Government, changes in revenues related to these contracts are expressed in terms of volume.  Changes in segment profit for these contracts are typically expressed in terms of volume and mix and performance; these include cumulative catch-up adjustments associated with a) revisions to the transaction price that may reflect contract modifications or changes in assumptions related to award fees and other variable consideration or b) changes in the total estimated costs at completion due to improved or deteriorated operating performance.\nTextron Aviation\nTextron Aviation Revenues and Operating Expenses\nFactors contributing to the 2020 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:\nTextron Aviation’s revenues decreased $1.2 billion, 23%, in 2020, compared with 2019, largely due to lower Citation jet volume of $688 million and lower commercial turboprop volume of $228 million, reflecting a decline in demand related to the pandemic, and lower aftermarket volume of $337 million, reflecting lower aircraft utilization resulting from the pandemic.  We delivered 132 Citation jets and 113 commercial turboprops in 2020, compared with 206 Citation jets and 176 commercial turboprops in 2019.\nTextron Aviation’s operating expenses decreased $780 million, 16%, in 2020, compared with 2019, largely due to lower volume and mix described above. A favorable impact from cost reduction activities, including employee furloughs and other actions, was more than offset by $115 million of idle facility costs recognized in the period and higher inventory valuation charges of $60 million, largely resulting from the pandemic. Idle facility costs reflect unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs attributable to abnormally low production levels resulting from the pandemic and temporary manufacturing facility closures.\n22\nTextron Aviation Segment Profit\nFactors contributing to 2020 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below:\nTextron Aviation’s segment profit decreased $433 million, in 2020, compared with 2019, due to the impact from lower volume and mix described above. Performance includes $115 million of idle facility costs, described above, and higher inventory valuation charges of $60 million, largely resulting from the pandemic, partially offset by a favorable impact from cost reduction activities described above.\nBell\nBell’s major U.S. Government programs at this time are the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft and the H-1 helicopter platforms, which are both in the production and support stage and represent a significant portion of Bell’s revenues from the U.S. Government.\nBell Revenues and Operating Expenses\nFactors contributing to the 2020 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:\nBell’s revenues increased $55 million, 2%, in 2020, compared with 2019, due to higher military revenues of $225 million, largely reflecting spares and logistics support, partially offset by lower commercial revenues. We delivered 140 commercial helicopters in 2020, compared with 201 commercial helicopters in 2019.\nBell’s operating expenses increased $28 million, 1%, in 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to higher net volume and mix as described above.\nBell Segment Profit\nFactors contributing to 2020 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below:\nBell’s segment profit increased $27 million, 6%, in 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to the impact from higher volume and mix described above, and a favorable impact from performance and other of $11 million.  Performance and other includes\n23\nlower research and development and selling and administrative costs, partially offset by $25 million in lower net favorable program adjustments.\nBell Backlog\nBell’s backlog decreased $1.6 billion, 23%, in 2020, primarily as a result of revenues recognized on our U.S. Government contracts in excess of new contracts received.\nTextron Systems\nTextron Systems Revenues and Operating Expenses\nFactors contributing to the 2020 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:\nRevenues at Textron Systems decreased $12 million in 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to lower volume of $36 million in the Simulation, Training and Other product line and $29 million in the Marine and Land Systems product line, partially offset by higher volume of $49 million in the Unmanned Systems product line. Within the Simulation, Training and Other product line, lower volume of $107 million in the TRU Simulation + Training business, largely due to a decline in demand and order cancellations related to the pandemic, was largely offset by higher volumes at other businesses included in this product line.\nTextron Systems’ operating expenses decreased $23 million, 2%, in 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to lower net volume described above.\nTextron Systems Segment Profit\nFactors contributing to 2020 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below:\nTextron Systems’ segment profit increased $11 million, 8%, in 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to favorable product mix.  Performance and other includes the impact of an $18 million gain recognized in the second quarter of 2019 related to our contribution of assets to a training business formed with FlightSafety International, Inc.\nTextron Systems Backlog\nBacklog at Textron Systems’ increased $1.3 billion in 2020, primarily due to new contracts received in excess of revenues recognized across all product lines.\n24\nIndustrial\nIndustrial Revenues and Operating Expenses\nFactors contributing to the 2020 year-over-year revenue change are provided below:\nIndustrial segment revenues decreased $798 million, 21%, in 2020, compared with 2019, largely due to lower volume and mix, in both product lines. Lower volume in the Fuel Systems and Functional Components product line was primarily related to manufacturing facility closures in the first half of 2020 as a result of the pandemic. As our OEM customers reopened and resumed production, all of our manufacturing facilities had reopened by the end of the second quarter. In the Specialized Vehicles product line, lower volume and mix was primarily related to reduced demand in the ground support equipment business, which has been impacted by the reduction in global air travel, as well as reduced demand in certain consumer and commercial markets that have been impacted by the pandemic.\nOperating expenses for the Industrial segment decreased $692 million, 19%, in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to lower volume and mix described above.\nIndustrial Segment Profit\nFactors contributing to 2020 year-over-year segment profit change are provided below:\nSegment profit for the Industrial segment decreased $106 million in 2020, compared with 2019, largely resulting from lower volume and mix described above, partially offset by favorable performance of $61 million. Performance includes the impact from cost reduction activities, partially offset by idle facility costs of $27 million recognized in 2020, reflecting unfavorable absorption of manufacturing costs attributable to abnormally low production levels resulting from the pandemic and temporary manufacturing facility closures.\n25\nFinance\nFinance segment revenues decreased $11 million in 2020, compared with 2019, and segment profit decreased $18 million in 2020, compared with 2019, primarily due to higher provision for loan losses. The following table reflects information about the Finance segment’s credit performance related to finance receivables.\nThe Finance segment has provided temporary payment relief through loan modifications at the request of certain customers and continues to work with certain customers to provide extended payment relief as needed. If the current economic conditions continue to persist or worsen, we may experience increased customer delinquencies, however, we believe our allowance for credit losses adequately covers our exposure on these loans as our estimated collateral values largely exceed the outstanding loan amounts. Loan modifications and key portfolio quality indicators are discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups.  The Manufacturing group consists of Textron consolidated with its majority-owned subsidiaries that operate in the Textron Aviation, Bell, Textron Systems and Industrial segments.  The Finance group, which also is the Finance segment, consists of Textron Financial Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. We designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the Finance group. Our Manufacturing group operations include the development, production and delivery of tangible goods and services, while our Finance group provides financial services.  Due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities, investors, rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group’s performance. To support those evaluations, we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nKey information that is utilized in assessing our liquidity is summarized below:\nThe unprecedented conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic led to volatility in the capital markets and uncertainty in the economic outlook, in addition to causing various degrees of disruption in our operations.  In light of these conditions, we have strengthened our cash position since the onset of the pandemic by taking various measures to reduce costs and conserve cash, and by increasing our borrowings as discussed below.  Given our strengthened liquidity position and stabilization of the capital markets in the second half of 2020, we reactivated our share repurchase plan in the fourth quarter.  We believe that we will have\n26\nsufficient cash to meet our needs based on our existing cash balances, the cash we expect to generate from our manufacturing operations and the availability of our existing credit facility.\nCredit Facilities and Other Sources of Capital\nTextron has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for an aggregate principal amount of Textron has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for an aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion, of which up to $100 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit. We may elect to increase the aggregate amount of commitments under the facility to up to $1.3 billion by designating an additional lender or by an existing lender agreeing to increase its commitment. The facility expires in October 2024, subject to up to two one-year extensions at our option with the consent of lenders representing a majority of the commitments under the facility.  At January 2, 2021 and January 4, 2020, there were no amounts borrowed against the facility and there were $9 million and $10 million, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility.\nWe also maintain an effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to issue an unlimited amount of public debt and other securities. In March 2020, we issued $650 million in SEC-registered fixed-rate notes due June 2030, with an annual interest rate of 3.00%.  In August 2020, we issued $500 million of SEC-registered fixed-rate notes due March 2031 with an annual interest rate of 2.45%, the proceeds of which were used to repay $500 million of outstanding borrowings under a new 364-Day Term Loan Credit Agreement entered into in April 2020.\nIn September 2020, the Finance Group’s $150 million variable-rate loan due December 2020 was amended to extend its maturity date to September 2021, with an option to extend for an additional year. The annual interest rate was modified from the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) plus 1.125% to LIBOR plus 1.55%, which is an annual interest rate of 1.70% at January 2, 2021.\nManufacturing Group Cash Flows\nCash flows from continuing operations for the Manufacturing group as presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are summarized below:\nCash flows from operating activities were $833 million in 2020 compared with $960 million in 2019, a decrease of $127 million.  The change in cash flows primarily reflected an $893 million year over year increase in cash used to settle accounts payable, principally at the Textron Aviation segment, and lower earnings, partially offset by a $753 million reduction in cash used for inventories, primarily at the Textron Aviation segment, a $299 million increase in cash flows from contract assets/liabilities, primarily at the Bell segment, and other favorable improvements in working capital accounts.\nNet tax payments were $34 million and $120 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Pension contributions were $47 million and $51 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn 2020 and 2019, investing cash flows included capital expenditures of $317 million and $339 million, respectively. Cash flows provided by financing activities in 2020 primarily included $1.1 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and $377 million of proceeds from borrowings against corporate-owned life insurance policies. These cash inflows were partially offset by $548 million of payments on long-term debt, $377 million of payments on borrowings against corporate-owned life insurance policies, and $183 million of cash paid to repurchase an aggregate of 4.1 million shares of our common stock under both a prior 2018 share repurchase plan and a 2020 share repurchase plan described below.  In 2019, cash flows used in financing activities primarily included $503 million of cash paid to repurchase an aggregate of 10.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock under a 2018 share repurchase authorization and $252 million of payments on long-term debt, partially offset by net proceeds of $301 million from the issuance of long-term debt.\nOn February 25, 2020, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 25 million shares of our common stock. This plan allows us to opportunistically repurchase shares and to continue our practice of repurchasing shares to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under compensation and benefit plans. The 2020 plan has no expiration date and replaced the prior 2018 share repurchase authorization.\nDividend payments to shareholders totaled $18 million in both 2020 and 2019. In 2019, dividends of $50 million received from the Finance group are included within cash flows from operating activities for the Manufacturing group as they represent a return on investment.\n27\nFinance Group Cash Flows\nThe cash flows from continuing operations for the Finance group as presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are summarized below:\nThe Finance group’s cash flows from operating activities were $13 million in 2020, compared with $34 million in 2019, a decrease of $21 million, primarily reflecting higher net tax payments and lower earnings. Cash flows from investing activities primarily included collections on finance receivables totaling $128 million and $277 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, partially offset by finance receivable originations of $195 million and $184 million, respectively.\nCash flows used in financing activities included payments on long-term and nonrecourse debt of $45 million and $51 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Dividend payments to the Manufacturing group totaled $50 million in 2019.\nConsolidated Cash Flows\nThe consolidated cash flows from continuing operations, after elimination of activity between the borrowing groups, are summarized below:\nConsolidated cash flows from operating activities were $769 million in 2020, compared with $1.0 billion in 2019, a decrease of $247 million.  The change in cash flows primarily reflected an $893 million year over year increase in cash used to settle accounts payable, principally at the Textron Aviation segment, lower earnings, and a $134 million net cash outflow from captive finance receivables, partially offset by a $726 million reduction in cash used for inventories, primarily at the Textron Aviation segment, a $299 million increase in cash flows from contract assets/liabilities, primarily at the Bell segment, and other favorable improvements in working capital accounts.\nNet tax payments were $42 million and $121 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Pension contributions were $47 million and $51 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn 2020 and 2019, investing cash flows included capital expenditures of $317 million and $339 million, respectively. Cash flows provided by financing activities in 2020 primarily included $1.1 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and $377 million from borrowings against corporate-owned life insurance policies. These cash inflows were partially offset by $593 million of payments on outstanding debt, $377 million of payments on borrowings against corporate-owned life insurance policies, and $183 million of share repurchases. In 2019, cash flows used in financing activities primarily included $503 million of share repurchases and $303 million of payments on outstanding debt, partially offset by $301 million of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt.\nCaptive Financing and Other Intercompany Transactions\nThe Finance group provides financing primarily to purchasers of new and pre-owned Textron Aviation aircraft and Bell helicopters manufactured by our Manufacturing group, otherwise known as captive financing. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash received from customers is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties. However, in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups, cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group. For example, when product is sold by our Manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the Finance group, the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the Finance group’s statement of cash flows. Meanwhile, in the Manufacturing group’s statement of cash flows, the cash received from the Finance group on the customer’s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow. Although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups, there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing. These captive financing activities, along with all significant intercompany transactions, are reclassified or eliminated from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n28\nReclassification adjustments included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are summarized below:\nUnder a Support Agreement between Textron and TFC, Textron is required to maintain a controlling interest in TFC. The agreement, as amended in December 2015, also requires Textron to ensure that TFC maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than 125% and consolidated shareholders' equity of no less than $125 million. There were no cash contributions required to be paid to TFC in 2020 and 2019 to maintain compliance with the support agreement.\nContractual Obligations\nManufacturing Group\nThe following table summarizes the known contractual obligations, as defined by reporting regulations, of our Manufacturing group as of January 2, 2021:\nPension and Postretirement Benefits\nWe maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Included in the above table are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors, including mortality assumptions, expected retirement age, rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates, which are subject to change in future years. Our policy for funding pension plans is to make contributions annually, consistent with applicable laws and regulations; however, future contributions to our pension plans are not included in the above table.  In 2021, we expect to make approximately $22 million of contributions to our funded pension plans. Based on our current assumptions, which may vary with changes in market conditions, our current contribution for each of the years from 2022 through 2025 is estimated to be approximately $51 million under the plan provisions in place at this time.\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\nOther long-term liabilities consist of undiscounted amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheets that primarily include obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs. Payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management’s assumptions of expected retirement age, mortality, stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals. The timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs is largely based on historical experience. Certain other long-term liabilities, such as deferred taxes, unrecognized tax benefits, and reserves for product liability, warranty, product maintenance and litigation, have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments.\nPurchase Obligations\nPurchase obligations include undiscounted amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price, quantity and delivery dates. Approximately 42% of the purchase obligations we\n29\ndisclose represent purchase orders issued for goods and services to be delivered under firm contracts with the U.S. Government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses.\nFinance Group\nThe following table summarizes the known contractual obligations, as defined by reporting regulations, of our Finance group as of January 2, 2021:\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nTo prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies. The accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below. We believe these policies require our most difficult, subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties. This section should be read in conjunction with Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which includes other significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nA substantial portion of our revenues is related to long-term contracts with the U.S. Government, including those under the U.S. Government-sponsored foreign military sales program, for the design, development, manufacture or modification of aerospace and defense products as well as related parts and services.  We generally use the cost-to-cost method to measure progress for these contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs on our contracts.  Under this measure, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation, and revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred.\nApproximately 75% of our 2020 revenues with the U.S. Government were under fixed-price and fixed-price incentive contracts. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit and could potentially incur a loss.\nThe transaction price for our contracts represents our best estimate of the consideration we will receive and includes assumptions regarding variable consideration as applicable. Certain of our long-term contracts contain incentive fees or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical performance, and all other information that is reasonably available to us.\nDue to the number of years it may take to complete many of our contracts and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contracts, the estimation of total transaction price and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables and, accordingly, is subject to change. In estimating total costs at completion, we are required to make numerous assumptions related to the complexity of design and related development work to be performed; engineering requirements; product performance; subcontractor performance; availability and cost of materials; labor productivity, availability and cost; overhead and capital costs; manufacturing efficiencies; the length of time to complete the contract (to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials); and costs of satisfying offset obligations, among other variables. Our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals. We review and update our cost projections quarterly or more frequently when circumstances significantly change. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total sales to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\nAt the outset of each contract, we estimate an initial profit booking rate considering the risks surrounding our ability to achieve the technical requirements (e.g., a newly-developed product versus a mature product), schedule (e.g., the number and type of milestone events), and costs by contract requirements in the initial estimated costs at completion. Profit booking rates may\n30\nincrease during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule, and cost aspects of the contract. Conversely, the profit booking rate may decrease if we are not successful in retiring the risks; and, as a result, our estimated costs at completion increase. All estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and, therefore, may affect the profit booking rate.\nChanges in our estimate of the total expected cost or in the transaction price for a contract typically impact our profit booking rate. We utilize the cumulative catch-up method of accounting to recognize the impact of these changes on our profit booking rate for a contract. Under this method, the inception-to-date impact of a profit adjustment on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. The impact of our cumulative catch-up adjustments on segment profit recognized in prior periods is presented below:\nDue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different revenues and/or cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if (a) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment, (b) total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation, (c) there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or (d) we are unable to meet contract milestones.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings or cash flows, or material adverse changes in the business climate, indicate a potential impairment of a reporting unit. A reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment, in which case such component is the reporting unit. In certain instances, we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics.\nWe calculate the fair value of each reporting unit using discounted cash flows. These cash flows incorporate assumptions for revenue growth rates, operating margins and discount rates that represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions, cost structure, anticipated net cost reductions, and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a business having similar risks and characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed. The revenue growth rates and operating margins are based on our strategic plans and long-range planning forecasts. The long-term revenue growth rate we use to determine the terminal value of the business is based on our assessment of its minimum expected terminal growth rate, as well as its past historical growth and broader economic considerations such as gross domestic product, inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve. The discount rates utilized in this analysis are based on each reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. We believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that an independent investor or market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed.\nIf the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment, and no further analysis is performed. Otherwise, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess carrying value over the estimated fair value amount. Based on our annual impairment review, the fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values, and we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any units might fail the impairment test in the foreseeable future.\nRetirement Benefits\nWe sponsor funded and unfunded domestic and international pension and postretirement plans for certain of our employees. Beginning on January 1, 2010, we initiated actions to commence the closure of the pension plans to new entrants. We provide employees hired subsequent to these closures with defined contribution benefits. Our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are calculated based on actuarial valuations. Key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses or benefits include the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost projections. We also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increases.  We evaluate and update these assumptions annually.\n31\nTo determine the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class.  A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense.  For 2020 and 2019, the assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was 7.55%. For 2020, the assumed rate of return for our domestic plans, which represent approximately 90% of our total pension assets, was 7.75%.  For 2021, to reflect the impact of current expectations of long-term market conditions on certain investment returns, we have assumed a long-term rate of return for our domestic plans of 7.25%. The change in this assumption will increase pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately $35 million.\nThe discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date, reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled. This rate should be in line with rates for high-quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits, which fluctuate as long-term interest rates change.  A lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense.  In 2020, the weighted-average discount rate used in calculating pension expense was 3.36%, compared with 4.24% in 2019.  For our domestic plans, the assumed discount rate was 3.45% in 2020, compared with 4.35% in 2019. A decrease of 50 basis-points in this weighted-average discount rate in 2020 would have increased pension cost for our domestic plans by approximately $64 million.\nActuarial gains and losses, representing differences between the assumptions utilized to develop estimated obligations and actual results or experience, that exceed 10% of the higher of the market related value of assets or the benefit obligation in a year, are initially recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and amortized over future years as a component of our annual benefit cost. We amortize actuarial differences over the average remaining service period of eligible employees. If all or almost all of a plan’s participants are inactive or are not accruing additional benefits, we amortize these differences over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants. As of the end of 2020, almost all of the participants in one of our domestic plans, the Textron Master Retirement Plan (TMRP), are no longer active. Beginning in 2021, actuarial gains and losses for this plan will be amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the participants. A change in the TMRP amortization period in 2021 from 7 years to 20 years will reduce pension cost by approximately $85 million. The deferral of these differences reduces the volatility of our annual benefit cost that can result either from year-to-year changes in the assumptions or from actual results that are not necessarily representative of the long-term financial position of these plans.\nThe trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate and has an important effect on postretirement liabilities. The 2020 medical and prescription drug cost trend rates represent the weighted-average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits. In 2020, we assumed a trend rate of 7% for both medical and prescription drug cost and assumed this rate would gradually decline to 5% by 2024 and then remain at that level."

    "text": "Foreign Currency Exchange Risk\nOur financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the various countries in which our products are manufactured and/or sold.  For our manufacturing operations, we manage our foreign currency transaction exposures by entering into foreign currency exchange contracts. These contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. The notional amount of outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts was $318 million and $342 million at January 2, 2021 and January 4, 2020, respectively.  We also may hedge exposures to certain of our foreign currency assets and earnings by funding those asset positions with debt in the same foreign currency so the exposures are naturally offset.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur financial results are affected by changes in interest rates. As part of managing this risk, we seek to achieve a prudent balance between floating- and fixed-rate exposures. We continually monitor our mix of these exposures and adjust the mix, as necessary. For our Finance group, we generally limit our risk to changes in interest rates with a strategy of matching floating-rate assets with floating-rate liabilities.  This strategy includes the use of interest rate swap agreements.  At the end of 2020, we had an interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of $294 million, which effectively converted certain floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate equivalent.\nQuantitative Risk Measures\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading. The financial instruments that are subject to market risk include finance receivables (excluding leases), debt (excluding finance lease obligations) and foreign currency exchange contracts. To quantify the market risk inherent in these financial instruments, we utilize a sensitivity analysis that includes a hypothetical change in fair value assuming a 10% decrease in interest rates and a 10% strengthening in foreign exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. The fair value of these financial instruments is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis and indicative market pricing as reported by leading financial news and data providers.\n32\nAt the end of each year, the table below provides the carrying and fair values of these financial instruments along with the sensitivity of fair value to the hypothetical changes discussed above. This sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future.\n* The value represents an asset or (liability).\n33"

Our financings are conducted through\ntwo\nseparate borrowing groups. The Manufacturing group consists of Textron Inc. consolidated with its majority-owned subsidiaries that operate in the Textron Aviation, Bell, Textron Systems and Industrial segments. The Finance group, which also is the Finance segment, consists of Textron Financial Corporation (TFC) and its consolidated subsidiaries. We designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the Finance group. Our Manufacturing group operations include the development, production and delivery of tangible goods and services, while our Finance group provides financial services. Due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group’s activities, investors, rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group’s performance. To support those evaluations, we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur Finance group provides financing primarily to purchasers of new and pre-owned Textron Aviation aircraft and Bell helicopters manufactured by our Manufacturing group, otherwise known as captive financing. In the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, cash received from customers is reflected as operating activities when received from third parties. However, in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups, cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group. For example, when product is sold by our Manufacturing group to a customer and is financed by the Finance group, the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow in the Finance group’s statement of cash flows. Meanwhile, in the Manufacturing group’s statement of cash flows, the cash received from the Finance group on the customer’s behalf is recorded within operating cash flows as a cash inflow. Although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups, there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing. These captive financing activities, along with all significant intercompany transactions, are reclassified or eliminated in consolidation.\nAt the beginning of 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\n. This standard changed the prior incurred loss model to a forward-looking current expected credit loss model for most financial assets, such as trade and finance receivables, contract assets and other instruments. There was no significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption of the standard.\nCollaborative Arrangements\nOur Bell segment has a strategic alliance agreement with The Boeing Company (Boeing) to provide engineering, development and test services related to the V-22 aircraft, as well as to produce the V-22 aircraft, under a number of separate contracts with the U.S. Government (V-22 Contracts). The alliance created by this agreement is not a legal entity and has no employees, no assets and no true operations. This agreement creates contractual rights and does not represent an entity in which we have an equity interest. We account for this alliance as a collaborative arrangement with Bell and Boeing reporting costs incurred and revenues generated from transactions with the U.S. Government in each company’s respective income statement. Neither Bell nor Boeing is considered to be the principal participant for the transactions recorded under this agreement. Profits on cost-plus contracts are allocated between Bell and Boeing on a 50%-50% basis. Negotiated profits on fixed-price contracts are also allocated 50%-50%; however, Bell and Boeing are each responsible for their own cost overruns and are entitled to retain any cost underruns. Based on the contractual arrangement established under the alliance, Bell accounts for its rights and obligations under the specific requirements of the V-22 Contracts allocated to Bell under the work breakdown structure. We account for all of our rights and obligations, including warranty, product and any contingent liabilities, under the specific requirements of the V-22 Contracts allocated to us under the agreement. Revenues and cost of sales reflect our performance under the V-22 Contracts with revenues recognized using the cost-to-cost method.  We include all assets used in performance of the V-22 Contracts that we own and all liabilities arising from our obligations under the V-22 Contracts in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of changes, if any, are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period that they are determined.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of the goods or services promised under the contract is transferred to the customer either at a point in time (e.g., upon delivery) or over time (e.g., as we perform under the contract). We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights and payment terms of the parties are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. Contracts are reviewed to determine whether there is one or\n41\nmultiple performance obligations. A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer and represents the unit of accounting for revenue recognition. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the expected consideration, or the transaction price, is allocated to each performance obligation identified in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Revenue is then recognized for the transaction price allocated to the performance obligation when control of the promised goods or services underlying the performance obligation is transferred. Contract consideration is not adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component when, at contract inception, the period between when control transfers and when the customer will pay for that good or service is one year or less.\nCommercial Contracts\nThe majority of our contracts with commercial customers have a single performance obligation as there is only one good or service promised or the promise to transfer the goods or services is not distinct or separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time, which is generally when the customer obtains control of the asset upon delivery and customer acceptance.  Contract modifications that provide for additional distinct goods or services at the standalone selling price are treated as separate contracts.\nFor commercial aircraft, we contract with our customers to sell fully outfitted fixed-wing aircraft, which may include configuration options. The aircraft typically represents a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance and delivery. For commercial helicopters, our customers generally contract with us for fully functional basic configuration aircraft and control is transferred upon customer acceptance and delivery. At times, customers may separately contract with us for the installation of accessories and customization to the basic aircraft. If these contracts are entered into at or near the same time of the basic aircraft contract, we assess whether the contracts meet the criteria to be combined. For contracts that are combined, the basic aircraft and the accessories and customization, are typically considered to be distinct, and therefore, are separate performance obligations. For these contracts, revenue is recognized on the basic aircraft upon customer acceptance and transfer of title and risk of loss, and on the accessories and customization, upon delivery and customer acceptance. We utilize observable prices to determine the standalone selling prices when allocating the transaction price to these performance obligations.\nThe transaction price for our commercial contracts reflects our estimate of returns, rebates and discounts, which are based on historical, current and forecasted information. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in the transaction price and generally are not treated as separate performance obligations as these costs fulfill a promise to transfer the product to the customer. Taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities are recorded on a net basis.\nWe primarily provide standard warranty programs for products in our commercial businesses for periods that typically range from\none year\nto\nfive years\n. These assurance-type programs typically cannot be purchased separately and do not meet the criteria to be considered a performance obligation.\nU.S. Government Contracts\nOur contracts with the U.S. Government generally include the design, development, manufacture or modification of aerospace and defense products as well as related parts and services. These contracts, which also include those under the U.S. Government-sponsored foreign military sales program, accounted for approximately\n30\n% of total revenues in 2020.  The customer typically contracts with us to provide a significant service of integrating a complex set of tasks and components into a single project or capability, which often results in the delivery of multiple units. Accordingly, the entire contract is accounted for as one performance obligation. In certain circumstances, a contract may include both production and support services, such as logistics and parts plans, which are considered to be distinct in the context of the contract and represent separate performance obligations. When a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, we generally utilize the expected cost plus a margin approach to determine the standalone selling prices when allocating the transaction price.\nOur contracts are frequently modified for changes in contract specifications and requirements. Most of our contract modifications with the U.S. Government are for goods and services that are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration service provided in the context of the contract and are accounted for as part of that existing contract. The effect of these contract modifications on our estimates is recognized using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting.\nContracts with the U.S. Government generally contain clauses that provide lien rights to work-in-process along with clauses that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work-in-process. Due to the continuous transfer of control to the U.S. Government, we recognize revenue over the time that we perform under the contract. Selecting the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or service to be provided. We generally use the cost-to-cost method to measure progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs on our contracts.  Under this measure, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation, and revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred.\n42\nThe transaction price for our contracts represents our best estimate of the consideration we will receive and includes assumptions regarding variable consideration as applicable. Certain of our long-term contracts contain incentive fees or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical performance, and all other information that is reasonably available to us.\nTotal contract cost is estimated utilizing current contract specifications and expected engineering requirements. Contract costs typically are incurred over a period of several years, and the estimation of these costs requires substantial judgment. Our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals. We review and update our projections of costs quarterly or more frequently when circumstances significantly change.\nApproximately\n75\n% of our 2020 revenues with the U.S. Government were under fixed-price and fixed-price incentive contracts. Under the typical payment terms of these contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based or progress payments. Performance-based payments represent interim payments of up to\n90\n% of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments of up to\n80\n% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a small portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, these contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings, which we present as contract assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified in Accounts receivable, net. The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer. For cost-type contracts, we are generally paid for our actual costs incurred within a short period of time.\nFinance Revenues\nFinance revenues primarily include interest on finance receivables, finance lease earnings and portfolio gains/losses. Portfolio gains/losses include impairment charges related to repossessed assets and properties and gains/losses on the sale or early termination of finance assets. We recognize interest using the interest method, which provides a constant rate of return over the terms of the receivables. Accrual of interest income is suspended if credit quality indicators suggest full collection of principal and interest is doubtful. In addition, we automatically suspend the accrual of interest income for accounts that are contractually delinquent by more than\nthree months\nunless collection is not doubtful. Cash payments on nonaccrual accounts, including finance charges, generally are applied to reduce the net investment balance. Once we conclude that the collection of all principal and interest is no longer doubtful, we resume the accrual of interest and recognize previously suspended interest income at the time either a) the loan becomes contractually current through payment according to the original terms of the loan, or b) if the loan has been modified, following a period of performance under the terms of the modification.\nContract Estimates\nFor contracts where revenue is recognized over time, we recognize changes in estimated contract revenues, costs and profits using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. This method recognizes the cumulative effect of changes on current and prior periods with the impact of the change from inception-to-date recorded in the current period. Anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable.\nIn 2020, 2019 and 2018, our cumulative catch-up adjustments increased segment profit by $\n72\nmillion, $\n91\nmillion and $\n196\nmillion, respectively, and net income by $\n55\nmillion, $\n69\nmillion and $\n149\nmillion, respectively ($\n0.24\n, $\n0.30\nand $\n0.59\nper diluted share, respectively). In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized revenue from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods of $\n77\nmillion, $\n97\nmillion and $\n190\nmillion, which related to changes in profit booking rates that impacted revenue.\nFor 2020, 2019 and 2018, gross favorable adjustments totaled $\n148\nmillion, $\n173\nmillion and $\n249\nmillion, respectively. The 2018 favorable adjustments included $\n145\nmillion, largely related to overhead rate improvements and risk retirements associated with contracts in the Bell segment. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, gross unfavorable adjustments totaled $\n76\nmillion, $\n82\nmillion and $\n53\nmillion, respectively.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nContract assets arise from contracts when revenue is recognized over time and the amount of revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. These amounts are included in contract assets until the right to payment is no longer conditional on events other than the passage of time and are included in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Contract liabilities, which are primarily included in Other current liabilities, include deposits, largely from our commercial aviation customers, and billings in excess of revenue recognized.\n43\nThe incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer that is expected to be recovered is expensed as incurred when the period to be benefitted is one year or less.\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nAccounts receivable, net includes amounts billed to customers where the right to payment is unconditional. We maintain an allowance for credit losses for our commercial accounts receivable to provide for the estimated amount that will not be collected, even when the risk of loss is remote. The allowance is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exists and is established as a percentage of accounts receivable. We have identified pools with similar risk characteristics, based on customer and industry type and geographic location. The percentage is based on all available and relevant information including age of outstanding receivables and collateral value, if any, historical payment experience and loss history, current economic conditions, and, when reasonable and supportable factors exist, management’s expectation of future economic conditions. For amounts due from the U.S. Government, we have not established an allowance for credit losses as we have zero loss expectation based on a long history of no credit losses and the explicit guarantee of a sovereign entity.\nCash and Equivalents\nCash and equivalents consist of cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.  We value our inventories generally using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for certain qualifying inventories where LIFO provides a better matching of costs and revenues. We determine costs for our commercial helicopters on an average cost basis by model considering the expended and estimated costs for the current production release.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated primarily using the straight-line method.  We capitalize expenditures for improvements that increase asset values and extend useful lives.  Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows, the asset is written down to fair value.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid for the acquisition of a business over the fair values assigned to intangible and other net assets of the acquired business. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to an annual impairment test. We evaluate the recoverability of these assets in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings or cash flows, or material adverse changes in the business climate, indicate a potential impairment.\nFor our goodwill impairment test, we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit using discounted cash flows.  A reporting unit represents the operating segment unless discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by segment management for businesses one level below that operating segment, in which case such component is the reporting unit.  In certain instances, we have aggregated components of an operating segment into a single reporting unit based on similar economic characteristics. The discounted cash flows incorporate assumptions for revenue growth rates, operating margins and discount rates that represent our best estimates of current and forecasted market conditions, cost structure, anticipated net cost reductions, and the implied rate of return that we believe a market participant would require for an investment in a business having similar risks and characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is primarily determined using the relief of royalty method based on forecasted revenues and royalty rates. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. Otherwise, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value.\nAcquired intangible assets with finite lives are subject to amortization. These assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.  Amortization of these intangible assets is recognized over their estimated useful lives using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized. Approximately\n86\n% of our gross intangible assets are amortized based on the cash flow streams used to value the assets, with the remaining assets amortized using the straight-line method.\n44\nFinance Receivables\nFinance receivables primarily include loans provided to purchasers of new and pre-owned Textron Aviation aircraft and Bell helicopters. Finance receivables are generally recorded at the amount of outstanding principal less allowance for losses.\nWe establish an allowance for credit losses to cover probable but specifically unknown losses existing in the portfolio. This allowance is established as a percentage of finance receivables categorized by pools with similar risk characteristics, such as collateral or customer type and geographic location. The percentage is based on a combination of factors, including historical loss experience, current delinquency and default trends, collateral values, current economic conditions, and, when reasonable and supportable factors exist, management’s expectation of future economic conditions.\nFor those finance receivables that do not have similar risk characteristics, including larger balance accounts specifically identified as impaired, a reserve is established based on comparing the expected future cash flows, discounted at the finance receivable's effective interest rate, or the fair value of the underlying collateral if the finance receivable is collateral dependent, to its carrying amount. The expected future cash flows consider collateral value; financial performance and liquidity of our borrower; existence and financial strength of guarantors; estimated recovery costs, including legal expenses; and costs associated with the repossession and eventual disposal of collateral. When there is a range of potential outcomes, we perform multiple discounted cash flow analyses and weight the potential outcomes based on their relative likelihood of occurrence. The evaluation of our portfolio is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired finance receivables and the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, which may differ from actual results. While our analysis is specific to each individual account, critical factors included in this analysis include industry valuation guides, age and physical condition of the collateral, payment history, and existence and financial strength of guarantors.\nFinance receivables are charged off at the earlier of the date the collateral is repossessed or when management no longer deems the receivable collectible.  Repossessed assets are recorded at their fair value, less estimated cost to sell.\nPension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations\nWe maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally. Our pension plans include significant benefit obligations, which are calculated based on actuarial valuations.  Key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates and healthcare cost projections.  We evaluate and update these assumptions annually in consultation with third-party actuaries and investment advisors.  We also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increases.\nFor our year-end measurement, our defined benefit plan assets and obligations are measured as of the month-end date closest to our fiscal year-end. We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our pension and postretirement plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognize changes in the funded status of our defined benefit plans in comprehensive income (loss) in the year in which they occur.  To the extent actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the higher of the market-related value of assets or the benefit obligation in a year, the excess is recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is amortized into net periodic pension cost over the remaining service period of the active participants.  For plans in which all or almost all of the plan’s participants are inactive, the amortization period is the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants.  This determination is made on a plan-by-plan basis.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nWe are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.  We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  To manage the volatility relating to our exposures, we net these exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets.  For the residual portion, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices.  Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is considered minimal and is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and through periodic settlements of positions.\nAll derivative instruments are reported at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Designation to support hedge accounting is performed on a specific exposure basis.  For financial instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges, we record changes in the fair value of derivatives (to the extent they are effective as hedges) in other comprehensive income (loss), net of deferred taxes. Changes in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are recorded in earnings.\nForeign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars.  Adjustments from currency rate changes are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment account in shareholders’ equity until the related foreign entity is sold or substantially liquidated.\n45\nLeases\nWe identify leases by evaluating our contracts to determine if the contract conveys the right to use an identified asset for a stated period of time in exchange for consideration. Specifically, we consider whether we can control the underlying asset and have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits or outputs from the asset.  For our contracts that contain both lease components (e.g., fixed payments including rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs) and non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance costs, other goods/services), we allocate the consideration in the contract to each component based on its standalone price.  Leases with terms greater than 12 months are classified as either operating or finance leases at the commencement date.  For these leases, we capitalize the lesser of a) the present value of the minimum lease payments over the lease term, or b) the fair value of the asset, as a right-of-use asset with an offsetting lease liability. The discount rate used to calculate the present value of the minimum lease payments is typically our incremental borrowing rate, as the rate implicit in the lease is generally not known or determinable. The lease term includes any noncancelable period for which we have the right to use the asset and may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option.  Operating leases are recognized as a single lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while finance lease cost is recognized separately as amortization and interest expense.\nProduct Liabilities\nWe accrue for product liability claims and related defense costs when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.  Our estimates are generally based on the specifics of each claim or incident and our best estimate of the probable loss using historical experience.\nEnvironmental Liabilities and Asset Retirement Obligations\nLiabilities for environmental matters are recorded on a site-by-site basis when it is probable that an obligation has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated.  We estimate our accrued environmental liabilities using currently available facts, existing technology, and presently enacted laws and regulations, all of which are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties. Our environmental liabilities are not discounted and do not take into consideration possible future insurance proceeds or significant amounts from claims against other third parties.\nWe have incurred asset retirement obligations primarily related to costs to remove and dispose of underground storage tanks and asbestos materials used in insulation, adhesive fillers and floor tiles. Currently, there is no legal requirement to remove these items  and there is no plan to remodel the related facilities or otherwise cause the impacted items to require disposal. Since these asset retirement obligations are not probable, there is\nno\nrelated liability recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWarranty Liabilities\nFor our assurance-type warranty programs, we estimate the costs that may be incurred and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenues are recognized.  Factors that affect this liability include the number of products sold, historical costs per claim, length of warranty period, contractual recoveries from vendors and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, including production and warranty patterns for new models.  We assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability periodically and adjust the amounts as necessary.  Additionally, we may establish a warranty liability related to the issuance of aircraft service bulletins for aircraft no longer covered under the limited warranty programs.\nResearch and Development Costs\nOur customer-funded research and development costs are charged directly to the related contracts, which primarily consist of U.S. Government contracts.  In accordance with government regulations, we recover a portion of company-funded research and development costs through overhead rate charges on our U.S. Government contracts.  Research and development costs that are not reimbursable under a contract with the U.S. Government or another customer are charged to expense as incurred.  Company-funded research and development costs were $\n549\nmillion, $\n647\nmillion and $\n643\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are included in cost of sales.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income tax expense is calculated on reported income before income taxes based on current tax law and includes, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Tax laws may require items to be included in the determination of taxable income at different times from when the items are reflected in the financial statements. Deferred tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates in effect for the year taxes are expected to be paid or recovered.\nDeferred tax assets represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future years and require certain estimates and assumptions to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the benefit will not be realized.  The recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits is determined by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback\n46\nyears, estimated future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. Should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate recoverability of a deferred tax asset, we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in income tax expense.\nWe record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s evaluation of the information available at the reporting date.  To be recognized in the financial statements, the tax position must meet the more-likely-than-not threshold that the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authority based on technical merits assuming the tax authority has full knowledge of all relevant information.  For positions meeting this recognition threshold, the benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold to be sustained. We periodically evaluate these tax positions based on the latest available information.  For tax positions that do not meet the threshold requirement, we recognize net tax-related interest and penalties for continuing operations in income tax expense.\nNote 2.\nBusiness Dispositions\nOn November 25, 2020, we reached a definitive agreement to sell TRU Simulation + Training Canada Inc. within our Textron Systems segment. At January 2, 2021, the assets and liabilities of this business met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or fair value, less cost to sell. The net carrying amounts classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet included $\n78\nmillion of assets, primarily inventories, recorded in Other current assets and $\n77\nmillion of liabilities, primarily contract liabilities, recorded in Other current liabilities.  The transaction closed on January 25, 2021, and we expect to record an after-tax gain of approximately $\n10\nmillion in the first quarter of 2021.\nOn July 2, 2018, we completed the sale of the businesses that manufacture and sell the products in our Tools and Test Equipment product line within our Industrial segment for net cash proceeds of $\n807\nmillion. We recorded an after-tax gain of $\n419\nmillion related to this disposition.\nNote 3.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment are as follows:\n(a)\nSee Note 7 for additional information.\n(b)\nReclassifications include $\n12\nmillion of goodwill classified as held for sale in connection with a business disposition described in Note 2 and amounts transferred between segments.\nIntangible Assets\nOur intangible assets are summarized below:\n47\nTrade names and trademarks in the table above include $\n169\nmillion and $\n208\nmillion of indefinite-lived intangible assets at January 2, 2021 and January 4, 2020, respectively.  In 2020, we recognized $\n47\nmillion of intangible asset impairment charges, primarily related to indefinite-lived assets as discussed in Note 17.  Amortization expense totaled $\n54\nmillion, $\n59\nmillion and $\n66\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization expense is estimated to be approximately $\n51\nmillion, $\n51\nmillion, $\n35\nmillion, $\n32\nmillion and $\n30\nmillion in 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.\nNote 4.\nAccounts Receivable and Finance Receivables\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable is composed of the following:\nFinance Receivables\nFinance receivables are presented in the following table:\nFinance receivables primarily includes loans provided to purchasers of new and pre-owned Textron Aviation aircraft and Bell helicopters. These loans typically have initial terms ranging from\nfive\nto\ntwelve years\n, amortization terms ranging from\neight\nto\nfifteen years\nand an average balance of $\n1.6\nmillion at January 2, 2021. Loans generally require the customer to pay a significant down payment, along with periodic scheduled principal payments that reduce the outstanding balance through the term of the loan.\nOur finance receivables are diversified across geographic region and borrower industry. At both January 2, 2021 and January 4, 2020,\n59\n% of our finance receivables were distributed internationally and\n41\n% throughout the U.S. At January 2, 2021 and January 4, 2020, finance receivables of $\n125\nmillion and $\n148\nmillion, respectively, have been pledged as collateral for TFC’s debt of $\n68\nmillion and $\n87\nmillion, respectively.\nFinance Receivable Portfolio Quality\nWe internally assess the quality of our finance receivables based on a number of key credit quality indicators and statistics such as delinquency, loan balance to estimated collateral value and the financial strength of individual borrowers and guarantors.  Because many of these indicators are difficult to apply across an entire class of receivables, we evaluate individual loans on a quarterly basis and classify these loans into three categories based on the key credit quality indicators for the individual loan. These three categories are performing, watchlist and nonaccrual.\nWe classify finance receivables as nonaccrual if credit quality indicators suggest full collection of principal and interest is doubtful. In addition, we automatically classify accounts as nonaccrual once they are contractually delinquent by more than\nthree months\nunless collection of principal and interest is not doubtful. Accounts are classified as watchlist when credit quality indicators have deteriorated as compared with typical underwriting criteria, and we believe collection of full principal and interest is probable but not certain. All other finance receivables that do not meet the watchlist or nonaccrual categories are classified as performing.\nWe measure delinquency based on the contractual payment terms of our finance receivables.  In determining the delinquency aging category of an account, any/all principal and interest received is applied to the most past-due principal and/or interest amounts due. If a significant portion of the contractually due payment is delinquent, the entire finance receivable balance is reported in accordance with the most past-due delinquency aging category.\n48\nIn March 2020, due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and at the request of certain of our customers, we began working with them to provide temporary payment relief through loan modifications. The types of temporary payment relief we offered to these customers included delays in the timing of required principal payments, deferrals of interest payments and/or interest-only payments. For loan modifications that cover payment-relief periods in excess of\nsix months\n, even if the loan was previously current, the loan is deemed a troubled debt restructuring and considered impaired. These impaired loans are classified as either nonaccrual or watchlist based on a review of the credit quality indicators as discussed above.\nDuring 2020, we modified finance receivable contracts for\n94\ncustomers with an outstanding balance totaling $\n278\nmillion at January 2, 2021. Of the modifications occurring during 2020, contracts for\n32\ncustomers, or $\n129\nmillion of finance receivables, were categorized as troubled debt restructurings. Due to the nature of these restructurings, the financial effects were not significant. We had\ntwo\ncustomer defaults related to finance receivables previously modified as a troubled debt restructuring that had an insignificant outstanding balance. We believe our allowance for credit losses adequately covers our exposure on these loans as our estimated collateral values largely exceed the outstanding loan amounts.\nFinance receivables categorized based on the credit quality indicators and by delinquency aging category are  summarized as follows:\nAt January 2, 2021,\n48\n% of our performing finance receivables were originated since the beginning of 2019 and\n26\n% were originated from 2016 to 2018. For finance receivables categorized as watchlist and nonaccrual,\n9\n% and\n25\n%, respectively, were originated since the beginning of 2019, and\n47\n% and\n36\n%, respectively, from 2016 to 2018. For accounts modified in 2020, the origination date prior to the modification was maintained based on the types of temporary payment relief provided.\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate individual larger balance accounts for impairment.  A finance receivable is considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement based on our review of the credit quality indicators described above.  Impaired finance receivables include both nonaccrual accounts and accounts for which full collection of principal and interest remains probable, but the account’s original terms have been, or are expected to be, significantly modified.  If the modification specifies an interest rate equal to or greater than a market rate for a finance receivable with comparable risk, the account is not considered impaired in years subsequent to the modification.\nA summary of impaired finance receivables, excluding leveraged leases, and the average recorded investment is provided below:\n49\nA summary of the allowance for losses on finance receivables based on how the underlying finance receivables are evaluated for impairment, is provided below.  The finance receivables reported in this table exclude $\n95\nmillion and $\n104\nmillion of leveraged leases at January 2, 2021 and January 4, 2020, respectively, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nNote 5.\nInventories\nInventories are composed of the following:\nInventories valued by the LIFO method totaled $\n2.2\nbillion and $\n2.5\nbillion at January 2, 2021 and January 4, 2020, respectively, and the carrying values of these inventories would have been higher by approximately $\n507\nmillion and $\n475\nmillion, respectively, had our LIFO inventories been valued at current costs.\nNote 6.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nOur Manufacturing group’s property, plant and equipment, net is composed of the following:\nThe Manufacturing group’s depreciation expense, which included amortization expense on finance leases, totaled $\n325\nmillion, $\n346\nmillion and $\n358\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNote 7.\nOther Assets\nOther assets includes the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies, net of any borrowings against these policies. During the first quarter of 2020, we borrowed $\n377\nmillion against the policies as we strengthened our cash position in light of disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These borrowings were subsequently repaid and there were\nno\noutstanding borrowings against these policies at January 2, 2021. Proceeds from these borrowings and subsequent payments have been classified as financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Interest expense incurred on borrowings against corporate-owned life insurance policies is recorded as an offset with policy income.\nIn 2019, TRU Simulation + Training Inc., a business within our Textron Systems segment, contributed assets associated with its training business into FlightSafety Textron Aviation Training LLC, a company formed by FlightSafety International Inc. and TRU to provide training solutions for Textron Aviation’s commercial business and general aviation aircraft.  We have a\n30\n% interest in this company and our investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  We contributed assets with a carrying value of $\n69\nmillion to the company, which primarily included property, plant and equipment.  In addition, $\n71\nmillion of the Textron Systems segment’s goodwill was allocated to this transaction.  Based on the fair value of our share of the business, we recorded a pre-tax net gain of $\n18\nmillion in 2019 to cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n50\nNote 8.\nOther Current Liabilities\nThe other current liabilities of our Manufacturing group are summarized below:\nChanges in our warranty liability are as follows:\n* Adjustments include changes to prior year estimates, new issues on prior year sales, reclassifications to held for sale, business acquisitions/dispositions and currency translation adjustments.\nNote 9.\nLeases\nWe primarily lease certain manufacturing plants, offices, warehouses, training and service centers at various locations worldwide that are classified as either operating or finance leases. Our leases have remaining lease terms up to\n28\nyears, which include options to extend the lease term for periods up to\n25\nyears when it is reasonably certain the option will be exercised.\nOperating lease cost totaled $\n61\nmillion and $\n64\nmillion, in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Finance lease cost and variable and short-term lease costs were not significant.  In 2020 and 2019, cash paid for operating lease liabilities totaled $\n60\nmillion and $\n62\nmillion, respectively, which is classified as cash flows from operating activities. Noncash transactions totaled $\n119\nmillion in 2020 and $\n25\nmillion in 2019, reflecting the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities for new or extended leases.\nBalance sheet and other information related to our leases is as follows:\n51\nMaturities of our lease liabilities at January 2, 2021 are as follows:\nNote 10.\nDebt and Credit Facilities\nOur debt is summarized in the table below:\n* Notes amortize on a monthly basis and are secured by finance receivables as described in Note 4.\nThe following table shows required payments during the next five years on debt outstanding at January 2, 2021:\nTextron has a senior unsecured revolving credit facility for an aggregate principal amount of $\n1.0\nbillion, of which up to $\n100\nmillion is available for the issuance of letters of credit. We may elect to increase the aggregate amount of commitments under the facility to up to $\n1.3\nbillion by designating an additional lender or by an existing lender agreeing to increase its commitment. The facility expires in October 2024, subject to up to\ntwo\none\n-year extensions at our option with the consent of lenders representing a\n52\nmajority of the commitments under the facility.  At January 2, 2021 and January 4, 2020, there were\nno\namounts borrowed against the facility and there were $\n9\nmillion and $\n10\nmillion, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility.\nFixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Notes\nThe Finance group’s $\n294\nmillion of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Notes are unsecured and rank junior to all of its existing and future senior debt. The notes mature on\nFebruary 15, 2067\n; however, we have the right to redeem the notes at par at any time and we are obligated to redeem the notes beginning on\nFebruary 15, 2042\n.  During 2020, TFC repurchased $\n5\nmillion of these notes. Interest on the notes was fixed at\n6\n% through\nFebruary 15, 2017\nand is now variable at the\nthree-month London Interbank Offered Rate\n+\n1.735\n%.\nSupport Agreement\nUnder a Support Agreement between Textron and TFC, Textron is required to maintain a controlling interest in TFC. The agreement, as amended in December 2015, also requires Textron to ensure that TFC maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than\n125\n% and consolidated shareholders' equity of no less than $\n125\nmillion. There were\nno\ncash contributions required to be paid to TFC in 2020, 2019 and 2018 to maintain compliance with the support agreement.\nNote 11.\nDerivative Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\nWe measure fair value at the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  We prioritize the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability into a three-tier fair value hierarchy.  This fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority (Level 1) to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority (Level 3) to unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exist, requiring companies to develop their own assumptions.  Observable inputs that do not meet the criteria of Level 1, which include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, are categorized as Level 2.  Level 3 inputs are those that reflect our estimates about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances.  Valuation techniques for assets and liabilities measured using Level 3 inputs may include methodologies such as the market approach, the income approach or the cost approach and may use unobservable inputs such as projections, estimates and management’s interpretation of current market data.  These unobservable inputs are utilized only to the extent that observable inputs are not available or cost effective to obtain.\nAssets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nWe manufacture and sell our products in a number of countries throughout the world, and, therefore, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.  We primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with maturities of no more than\nthree years\nto manage this volatility.  These contracts qualify as cash flow hedges and are intended to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on forecasted sales, inventory purchases and overhead expenses. Net gains and losses recognized in earnings and Accumulated other comprehensive loss on cash flow hedges, including gains and losses related to hedge ineffectiveness, were not significant in the periods presented.\nOur foreign currency exchange contracts are measured at fair value using the market method valuation technique.  The inputs to this technique utilize current foreign currency exchange forward market rates published by third-party leading financial news and data providers.  These are observable data that represent the rates that the financial institution uses for contracts entered into at that date; however, they are not based on actual transactions so they are classified as Level 2. At January 2, 2021 and January 4, 2020, we had foreign currency exchange contracts with notional amounts upon which the contracts were based of $\n318\nmillion and $\n342\nmillion, respectively. At January 2, 2021, the fair value amounts of our foreign currency exchange contracts were a $\n5\nmillion asset and a $\n2\nmillion liability.  At January 4, 2020, the fair value amounts of our foreign currency exchange contracts were a $\n2\nmillion asset and a $\n2\nmillion liability.\nOur Finance group enters into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. By using these contracts, we are able to convert floating-rate cash flows to fixed-rate cash flows.  These agreements are designated as cash flow hedges.  At January 2, 2021, we had one swap agreement that matures in February 2022 for a notional amount of $\n294\nmillion with a fair value of a $\n4\nmillion liability.\n53\nAssets and Liabilities Not Recorded at Fair Value\nThe carrying value and estimated fair value of our financial instruments that are not reflected in the financial statements at fair value are as follows:\nFair value for the Manufacturing group debt is determined using market observable data for similar transactions (Level 2).  The fair value for the Finance group debt was determined primarily based on discounted cash flow analyses using observable market inputs from debt with similar duration, subordination and credit default expectations (Level 2).  Fair value estimates for finance receivables were determined based on internally developed discounted cash flow models primarily utilizing significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), which include estimates of the rate of return, financing cost, capital structure and/or discount rate expectations of current market participants combined with estimated loan cash flows based on credit losses, payment rates and expectations of borrowers’ ability to make payments on a timely basis.\nNote 12.\nShareholders’ Equity\nCapital Stock\nWe have authorization for\n15\nmillion shares of preferred stock with a par value of $\n0.01\nand\n500\nmillion shares of common stock with a par value of $\n0.125\n.\nOutstanding common stock activity is presented below:\nEarnings Per Share\nWe calculate basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) based on net income, which approximates income available to common shareholders for each period.  Basic EPS is calculated using the two-class method, which includes the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period and restricted stock units to be paid in stock that are deemed participating securities as they provide nonforfeitable rights to dividends.  Diluted EPS considers the dilutive effect of all potential future common stock, including stock options.\nThe weighted-average shares outstanding for basic and diluted EPS are as follows:\nIn 2020, 2019 and 2018, stock options to purchase\n7.6\nmillion,\n4.3\nmillion and\n1.3\nmillion shares, respectively, of common stock are excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.\n54\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe components of Accumulated other comprehensive loss are presented below:\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nThe before and after-tax components of other comprehensive income (loss) are presented below:\n* These components of other comprehensive income (loss) are included in the computation of net periodic pension cost. See Note 16 for additional information.\nNote 13.\nSegment and Geographic Data\nWe operate in, and report financial information for, the following\nfive\nbusiness segments: Textron Aviation, Bell, Textron Systems, Industrial and Finance.

During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized revenues of $\n506\nmillion, $\n590\nmillion and $\n817\nmillion, respectively, that were included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of each year.\n58\nNote 15.\nShare-Based Compensation\nUnder our 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (Plan), which replaced our 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan in April 2015, we have authorization to provide awards to selected employees and non-employee directors in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock, performance share units and other awards.  A maximum of\n17\nmillion shares is authorized for issuance for all purposes under the Plan plus any shares that become available upon cancellation, forfeiture or expiration of awards granted under the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan. No more than\n17\nmillion shares may be awarded pursuant to incentive stock options, and no more than\n4.25\nmillion shares may be issued pursuant to awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance stock or other awards that are payable in shares. For 2020, 2019 and 2018, the awards granted under this Plan primarily included stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units.\nThrough our Deferred Income Plan for Textron Executives, we provide certain executives the opportunity to voluntarily defer up to\n80\n% of their base salary, along with incentive compensation.  Elective deferrals may be put into either a stock unit account or an interest-bearing account.  Participants cannot move amounts between the two accounts while actively employed by us and cannot receive distributions until termination of employment. The intrinsic value of amounts paid under this deferred income plan was not significant in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nShare-based compensation costs are reflected primarily in selling and administrative expense.\nCompensation expense included in net income for our share-based compensation plans is as follows:\nCompensation cost for awards subject only to service conditions that vest ratably is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. Our awards include continued vesting provisions for retirement eligible employees. Upon reaching retirement eligibility, the service requirement for these individuals is considered to have been satisfied and compensation expense for future awards is recognized on the date of the grant.\nAs of January 2, 2021, we had not recognized $\n30\nmillion of total compensation costs associated with unvested awards subject only to service conditions. We expect to recognize compensation expense for these awards over a weighted-average period of approximately\ntwo years\n.\nStock Options\nStock option compensation expense was $\n20\nmillion, $\n22\nmillion and $\n23\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Options to purchase our shares have a maximum term of\nten years\nand generally vest ratably over a\nthree-year\nperiod. Stock option compensation cost is calculated under the fair value approach using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of options granted on the date of grant. The expected volatility used in this model is based on historical volatilities and implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock. The expected term is based on historical option exercise data, which is adjusted to reflect any anticipated changes in expected behavior.\nWe grant options annually on the first day of March.\nThe assumptions used in our option-pricing model for these grants and the weighted-average fair value for these options are as follows:\n59\nThe stock option activity during 2020 is provided below:\nAt January 2, 2021, our outstanding options had an aggregate intrinsic value of $\n65\nmillion and a weighted-average remaining contractual life of\n5.8\nyears.  Our exercisable options had an aggregate intrinsic value of $\n48\nmillion and a weighted-average remaining contractual life of\n4.4\nyears at January 2, 2021.  The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n10\nmillion, $\n22\nmillion and $\n62\nmillion, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Units\nWe issue restricted stock units that include the right to receive dividend equivalents and are settled in both cash and stock.  Beginning in 2020, new grants of restricted stock units will vest in full on the third anniversary of the grant date.  Restricted stock units granted prior to 2020 vest one-third each in the third, fourth and fifth year following the year of the grant. The fair value of these units is based on the trading price of our common stock. For units payable in stock, we use the trading price on the grant date, while units payable in cash are remeasured using the price at each reporting period date.\nThe 2020 activity for restricted stock units is provided below:\nThe fair value of the restricted stock unit awards that vested and/or amounts paid under these awards is as follows:\nPerformance Share Units\nThe fair value of share-based compensation awards accounted for as liabilities includes performance share units, which are paid in cash in the first quarter of the year following vesting.  Beginning with grants made in 2020, performance share units are subject to performance goals set at the beginning of the three-year performance period.  Performance share units granted prior to 2020 are subject to performance goals set for each year of the three-year performance period. Performance share units vest at the end of the\nthree-year\nperformance period. The fair value of these units is based on the trading price of our common stock and is remeasured at each reporting period date.\nThe 2020 activity for our performance share units is as follows:\n60\nThe fair value of the performance share units that vested and/or amounts paid under these awards is as follows:\nNote 16.\nRetirement Plans\nWe provide defined-contribution benefits to eligible employees, as well as some remaining defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefits covering certain of our U.S. and Non-U.S. employees. Substantially all of our employees are covered by defined contribution plans.  The largest of these plans, the Textron Savings Plan, is a qualified 401(k) plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  Our defined contribution plans cost $\n128\nmillion, $\n130\nmillion and $\n125\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  We also provide postretirement benefits other than pensions for certain retired employees in the U.S. that include healthcare, dental care, Medicare Part B reimbursement and life insurance.\nA portion of our U.S. employees participate in the legacy defined benefit pension plans which were closed to new participants beginning on January 1, 2010.  These plans; the Textron Master Retirement Plan, the Bell Helicopter Textron Master Retirement Plan, and the CWC Castings Division of Textron Inc. Hourly-Rated Employees' Pension Plan, are subject to the provisions of ERISA and provide a minimum guaranteed benefit to participants. The primary factors affecting the benefits earned by participants in our pension plans are employees’ years of service and compensation levels. Employees hired subsequent to the closure of these plans receive an additional annual cash contribution to their Textron Savings Plan account based on their eligible compensation of up to\n4\n%.\nPeriodic Benefit Cost (Credit)\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) are as follows:\n* Excludes the cost associated with the defined contribution component, included in certain of our U.S.-based defined benefit pension plans, that totaled $\n11\nmillion in 2020 and $\n13\nmillion for both  2019 and 2018.\n61\nObligations and Funded Status\nAll of our plans are measured as of our fiscal year-end.\nThe changes in the projected benefit obligation and in the fair value of plan assets, along with our funded status, are as follows:\nActuarial losses (gains) reflected in the table above for both 2020 and 2019 were largely the result of changes in the discount rate utilized.\nAmounts recognized in our balance sheets are as follows:\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n9.3\nbillion and $\n8.5\nbillion at January 2, 2021 and January 4, 2020, respectively, which included $\n440\nmillion and $\n404\nmillion, respectively, in accumulated benefit obligations for unfunded plans where funding is not permitted or in foreign environments where funding is not feasible.\nPension plans with accumulated benefit obligation exceeding the fair value of plan assets are as follows:\n62\nPension plans with projected benefit obligation exceeding the fair value of plan assets are as follows:\nAssumptions\nThe weighted-average assumptions we use for our pension and postretirement plans are as follows:\nFor 2021, the long-term rate of return on assets for our domestic plans will be reduced from\n7.75\n% to\n7.25\n%, principally reflecting the impact of current expectations of long-term market conditions on certain investment returns.  As discussed in Note 1, actuarial gains and losses are amortized into net periodic pension cost based on either the remaining service period of the active participants or the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. As of January 2, 2021, almost all of the participants for our largest domestic plan, the TMRP, were considered inactive largely due to actions taken in prior years to close the plan to new entrants. Accordingly, the amortization period for this plan will change to the average remaining life expectancy of the participant; this change from\n7\nyears to\n20\nyears will reduce 2021 pension cost by approximately $\n85\nmillion.\nOur assumed healthcare cost trend rate for both the medical and prescription drug cost was\n7.00\n% in both 2020 and 2019. We expect this rate to gradually decline to\n5\n% by\n2024\nwhere we assume it will remain.\nPension Assets\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on a variety of considerations, including the established asset allocation targets and expectations for those asset classes, historical returns of the plans’ assets and other market considerations. We invest our pension assets with the objective of achieving a total rate of return over the long term that will be sufficient to fund future pension obligations and to minimize future pension contributions. We are willing to tolerate a commensurate level of risk to achieve this objective based on the funded status of the plans and the long-term nature of our pension liability. Risk is controlled by maintaining a portfolio of assets that is diversified across a variety of asset classes, investment styles and investment managers. Where possible, investment managers are prohibited from owning our securities in the portfolios that they manage on our behalf.\nFor U.S. plan assets, which represent the majority of our plan assets, asset allocation target ranges are established consistent with our investment objectives, and the assets are rebalanced periodically.  For Non-U.S. plan assets, allocations are based on expected cash flow needs and assessments of the local practices and markets.\nOur target allocation ranges are as follows:\n63\nThe fair value of our pension plan assets by major category and valuation method is as follows:\nCash and equivalents, equity securities and debt securities include comingled funds, which represent investments in funds offered to institutional investors that are similar to mutual funds in that they provide diversification by holding various equity and debt securities.  Since these comingled funds are not quoted on any active market, they are priced based on the relative value of the underlying equity and debt investments and their individual prices at any given time; these funds are not subject to leveling within the fair value hierarchy. Debt securities are valued based on same day actual trading prices, if available.  If such prices are not available, we use a matrix pricing model with historical prices, trends and other factors.\nPrivate investment partnerships represents interests in funds which invest in equity, debt and other financial assets.  These funds are generally not publicly traded so the interests therein are valued using income and market methods that include cash flow projections and market multiples for various comparable investments.  Real estate includes owned properties and limited partnership interests in real estate partnerships.  Owned properties are valued using certified appraisals at least every\nthree years\nthat are updated at least annually by the real estate investment manager based on current market trends and other available information. These appraisals generally use the standard methods for valuing real estate, including forecasting income and identifying current transactions for comparable real estate to arrive at a fair value.  Limited partnership interests in real estate partnerships are valued similarly to private investment partnerships, with the general partner using standard real estate valuation methods to value the real estate properties and securities held within their portfolios.  Neither private investment nor real estate partnerships are subject to leveling within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of the fair value measurements for owned real estate properties, which use significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):\n64\nEstimated Future Cash Flow Impact\nDefined benefits under salaried plans are based on salary and years of service.  Hourly plans generally provide benefits based on stated amounts for each year of service.  Our funding policy is consistent with applicable laws and regulations.  In 2021, we expect to contribute approximately $\n51\nmillion to our pension plans. Benefit payments provided below reflect expected future employee service, as appropriate, and are expected to be paid, net of estimated participant contributions. These payments are based on the same assumptions used to measure our benefit obligation at the end of 2020. While pension benefit payments primarily will be paid out of qualified pension trusts, we will pay postretirement benefits other than pensions out of our general corporate assets.\nBenefit payments that we expect to pay on an undiscounted basis are as follows:\nNote 17.\nSpecial Charges\nSpecial charges recorded by segment and type of cost are as follows:\n2020 COVID-19 Restructuring Plan\nIn the second quarter of 2020, we initiated a restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses through headcount reductions, facility consolidations and other actions in response to the economic challenges and uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of ongoing evaluations, this plan was expanded in the third quarter of 2020 to include additional headcount reductions and facility consolidations in the Industrial segment. The plan primarily impacts the TRU business within the Textron Systems segment, and the Industrial and Textron Aviation segments. At TRU, there has been a substantial decline in demand and order cancellations for flight simulators in light of the expected long-term impact of the pandemic on the commercial air transportation business. Accordingly, we ceased manufacturing at TRU’s facility in Montreal, Canada, resulting in a production suspension of its commercial air transport simulators, along with workforce reductions, contract terminations, facility closures and asset impairments. As a result of market conditions and the cessation of manufacturing at this facility, we incurred an inventory valuation charge of $\n55\nmillion in the second quarter of 2020, which was recorded in Cost of Sales, to write-down TRU’s inventory to its net realizable value. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we reached a definitive agreement to sell TRU Simulation + Training Canada Inc. as described in Note 2.\nThrough the end of 2020, we recorded pre-tax charges of $\n108\nmillion since the inception of the plan.  In 2021, we expect to incur additional contract termination costs and other charges in the range of $\n20\nmillion to $\n30\nmillion, primarily in the Industrial segment. We estimate a total reduction of\n2,700\npositions, representing\n8\n% of our workforce, and expect the plan to be substantially completed in the first half of 2021.\n65\n2020 Other Charges\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we recognized $\n39\nmillion of intangible asset impairment charges at the Textron Aviation and Industrial segments. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced decreased demand for our products and services as our customers delayed or ceased orders due to the environment of economic uncertainty. In light of these conditions, Textron Aviation had temporarily shut down most aircraft production, including the King Air turboprop and Beechcraft piston product lines, and had instituted employee furloughs. Based on these events, we performed an interim impairment test of the indefinite-lived Beechcraft and King Air trade name intangible assets at April 4, 2020. Fair value of these assets was determined utilizing the relief of royalty method assuming an increase in the discount rate based on market data to\n9.7\n% and revised expectations of future revenues for the products and services associated with the tradenames. This analysis resulted in an impairment charge of $\n32\nmillion. At January 2, 2021, these intangible assets totaled $\n169\nmillion.  In the Industrial segment, we fully impaired the Arctic Cat trade name intangible asset within the Specialized Vehicles product line and recorded a $\n7\nmillion impairment charge.\nOther Restructuring Plans\nIn 2019, we recorded $\n67\nmillion of special charges in connection with a restructuring plan that was designed to reduce costs and improve overall operating efficiency through headcount reductions, facility consolidations and other actions in the Industrial and Textron Aviation segments. In the Industrial segment, in connection with the strategic review of our Kautex business, cost reduction and other measures were initiated to maximize its operating margin, and we took further cost cutting actions in our Textron Specialized Vehicles businesses. In the Textron Aviation segment, we conducted a review of our ongoing workforce requirements, resulting in targeted headcount reductions and other actions to realign our cost structure. Headcount reductions totaling approximately\n1,000\npositions, which included business support and administrative functions within both segments, were completed in 2020. The headcount reductions at Textron Aviation were primarily related to engineering positions, reflecting completion of the Longitude certification activities and reduced requirements for ongoing development programs.\nIn 2018, we recorded $\n73\nmillion of special charges in connection with a plan to restructure the Textron Specialized Vehicles businesses within our Industrial segment, which included asset impairment charges of $\n47\nmillion, primarily intangible assets related to product rationalization, contract termination and other costs of $\n18\nmillion and severance costs of $\n8\nmillion. Headcount reductions totaled approximately\n400\npositions, representing\n10\n% of Textron Specialized Vehicles’ workforce.\nRestructuring Reserve\nOur restructuring reserve activity is summarized below:\n* Reclassifications include amounts classified as held for sale in connection with a business disposition described in Note 2.\nThe majority of the remaining cash outlays of $\n52\nmillion is expected to be paid in the first half of 2021. Severance costs generally are paid on a lump-sum basis and include outplacement costs, which are paid in accordance with normal payment terms.\nNote 18.\nIncome Taxes\nWe conduct business globally and, as a result, file numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns within and outside the U.S.  For all of our U.S. subsidiaries, we file a consolidated federal income tax return.\nIncome before income taxes is as follows:\n66\nIncome tax expense (benefit) is summarized as follows:\nThe following table reconciles the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate:\n(a)\nIn 2020, the benefit of research and development tax credits as a percentage of pre-tax income was higher than prior periods primarily due to lower pre-tax income. In 2019, $\n61\nmillion in benefits were recognized for additional tax credits related to prior years as a result of the completion of a research and development tax analysis.\n(b)\nIn 2020, the effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by a $\n55\nmillion inventory charge and special charges in a non-U.S. jurisdiction where tax benefits cannot be realized, along with a $\n10\nmillion tax expense related to a decision to dividend cash back from select non-U.S. jurisdictions to the U.S., partially offset by a $\n14\nmillion valuation allowance release.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nOur unrecognized tax benefits represent tax positions for which reserves have been established, with unrecognized  state tax benefits reflected net of applicable federal tax benefits. At the end of 2020, 2019 and 2018, if our unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in future periods, they would favorably impact our effective tax rate.\nA reconciliation of these unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nIn 2020, certain tax positions related to state tax attributes were reduced by $\n68\nmillion based on an audit settlement with respect to certain state income tax returns. In 2019, additional tax positions primarily reflect the completion of a research and development tax credit analysis for tax credits related to prior years. In 2018, certain tax positions related to research and development tax credits were reduced by $\n25\nmillion based on new information, including interactions with the tax authorities and recent audit settlements.\n67\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world. We are generally no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examinations for years before 2014, state and local income tax examinations for years before 2015, and non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2011.  In 2019, we filed U.S. federal amended returns for 2012 and 2013 for additional research and development tax credits that are subject to examination.\nDeferred Taxes\nThe significant components of our net deferred tax assets/(liabilities) are provided below:\n(a)\nAt January 2, 2021, U.S. operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits of $\n283\nmillion expire through 2040 if not utilized and $\n37\nmillion may be carried forward indefinitely.\n(b)\nAccrued liabilities include warranty reserves, self-insured liabilities and interest.\n(c)\nAt January 2, 2021, non-U.S. operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits of $\n29\nmillion expire through 2040 if not utilized and $\n36\nmillion may be carried forward indefinitely.\nWe believe earnings during the period when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits.  For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more than likely, a valuation allowance is provided.\nThe following table presents the breakdown of our deferred taxes:\nNon-U.S. and U.S. state income taxes have not been provided for on basis differences in certain investments, primarily as a result of unremitted earnings in foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested, totaled $\n1.7\nbillion at January 2, 2021 and  January 4, 2020. Should these earnings be distributed in the future in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to withholding and income taxes payable to various non-U.S. jurisdictions and U.S. states.  Determination of the deferred tax liability associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable due to multiple factors, including the complexity of non-U.S. tax laws and tax treaty interpretations, exchange rate fluctuations, and the uncertainty of available credits or exemptions under U.S. federal and state tax laws.\n68\nNote 19.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising out of the conduct of our business, including proceedings and claims relating to commercial and financial transactions; government contracts; alleged lack of compliance with applicable laws and regulations; production partners; product liability; patent and trademark infringement; employment disputes; and environmental, safety and health matters.  Some of these legal proceedings and claims seek damages, fines or penalties in substantial amounts or remediation of environmental contamination.  As a government contractor, we are subject to audits, reviews and investigations to determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  Under federal government procurement regulations, certain claims brought by the U.S. Government could result in our suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting for a period of time.  On the basis of information presently available, we do not believe that existing proceedings and claims will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into standby letter of credit agreements and surety bonds with financial institutions to meet various performance and other obligations.  These outstanding letter of credit arrangements and surety bonds aggregated to approximately $\n216\nmillion and $\n247\nmillion at January 2, 2021 and January 4, 2020, respectively.\nEnvironmental Remediation\nAs with other industrial enterprises engaged in similar businesses, we are involved in a number of remedial actions under various federal and state laws and regulations relating to the environment that impose liability on companies to clean up, or contribute to the cost of cleaning up, sites on which hazardous wastes or materials were disposed or released.  Our accrued environmental liabilities relate to installation of remediation systems, disposal costs, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversight costs, legal fees, and operating and maintenance costs for both currently and formerly owned or operated facilities.  Circumstances that can affect the reliability and precision of the accruals include the identification of additional sites, environmental regulations, level of cleanup required, technologies available, number and financial condition of other contributors to remediation and the time period over which remediation may occur.  We believe that any changes to the accruals that may result from these factors and uncertainties will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nBased upon information currently available, we estimate that our potential environmental liabilities are within the range of $\n40\nmillion to $\n150\nmillion. At January 2, 2021, environmental reserves of $\n76\nmillion have been established to address these specific estimated liabilities. We estimate that we will likely pay our accrued environmental remediation liabilities over the next\nten years\nand have classified $\n15\nmillion as current liabilities. Expenditures to evaluate and remediate contaminated sites were $\n7\nmillion, $\n13\nmillion and $\n13\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNote 20.\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\nOur cash payments and receipts are as follows:\n69\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Textron Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Textron Inc. (the Company) as of January 2, 2021 and January 4, 2020, the related Consolidated Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Income, Shareholders’ Equity and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 2, 2021, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule contained on page 73 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 2, 2021 and January 4, 2020 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 2, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) and our report dated February 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n70\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1957.\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 19, 2021\n71\nQuarterly Data\n* See Note 17 for additional information.\n72\nSchedule II — Valuation and Qualifying Accounts\n*\nDeductions primarily include amounts written off on uncollectible accounts (less recoveries), inventory disposals, changes to prior year estimates, reclassifications to held for sale, business dispositions and currency translation adjustments."

    "text": "Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 2, 2021. The evaluation was performed with the participation of senior management of each business segment and key Corporate functions, under the supervision of our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were operating and effective as of January 2, 2021.\nChanges in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for Textron Inc. as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Our internal control structure is designed to provide reasonable assurance, at appropriate cost, that assets are safeguarded and that transactions are properly executed and recorded. The internal control structure includes, among other things, established policies and procedures, an internal audit function, the selection and training of qualified personnel as well as management oversight.\nWith the participation of our management, we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based on our evaluation under the 2013 Framework, we have concluded that Textron Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2021.\nThe independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the Consolidated Financial Statements of Textron Inc. and has issued an attestation report on Textron’s internal controls over financial reporting as of January 2, 2021, as stated in its report, which is included herein.\n73\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Textron Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Textron Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control— Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Textron, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Company as of January 2, 2021 and January 4, 2020, and the related Consolidated Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Income, Shareholder’s Equity and Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 2, 2021, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule contained on page 73, of the Company and our report dated February 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 19, 2021\n74\nPART III"
