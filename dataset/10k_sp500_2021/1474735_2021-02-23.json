Our strategic plan centers around a number of key mega-trends that we believe will drive significant secular growth opportunities for our business. \"Grid 2.0,\" climate change, the abundance of natural gas globally, an aging infrastructure, and 5G telecommunications are all major themes that we believe will drive future long-term growth. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 has led to a new and emerging trend that we refer to as \"Home as a Sanctuary,\" where millions of people are working, learning, shopping, entertaining, and in general, spending more time at home, which has resulted in a significant increased awareness for backup power security and willingness to invest more in home improvement projects. As we continue to move our strategic plan into the future, we are focused on a number of initiatives that are driven by the following four key objectives:\nGrowing the residential power solutions market.\nThis encompasses the still underpenetrated market for home standby generators along with the emerging market for energy storage, monitoring and management systems. As the leader in the home standby generator market, it is incumbent upon us to continue to drive growth and increase the penetration rate of these products in households across the world. Central to this strategy is to increase the awareness, availability and affordability of home standby generators. Ongoing power outage activity due to more severe weather and an aging electrical grid, combined with expanding and developing our residential/light commercial dealer base and overall distribution in affected regions, are key drivers in elevating the awareness of home standby generators over the long term. We intend to continue to supplement these key growth drivers by focusing on a variety of strategic initiatives targeted toward generating increased sales leads, improving close rates and reducing the total overall cost of a home standby system. In addition, we intend to continue to focus on innovation in this growing product category and introduce new products and solutions into the marketplace. With only approximately 5.0% penetration of the addressable market of homes in the United States (which we define as single-family detached, owner-occupied households with a home value of over $125,000, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 American Housing Survey for the United States), we believe there are significant opportunities to further penetrate the residential standby generator market both domestically and internationally.\nIn early 2020, we launched our PWRcell™ energy storage system into the market and began to significantly ramp up our shipment volumes for these products. We expect the market for clean energy products to grow significantly as the energy landscape continues to change and favor on-site renewable power, and homeowners increasingly appreciate the improved payback and resiliency provided by these systems. We expect to further advance our growing capabilities for energy storage systems including product development, sourcing, distribution, and marketing, as well as leveraging our significant competencies developed over the past two decades to grow the residential standby generator market to accelerate our market position in the emerging residential energy storage, monitoring and management markets.\nGaining market share and entering new markets\n.\nWe continue to sharpen our focus on improving our share of the power equipment markets in which we participate around the world by emphasizing our innovation and continually expanding our product lines and services. We design and build a wide range of products from stationary, portable, and mobile generators, light towers, field and brush mowers and trimmers, pressure washers, pumps, and other engine powered equipment. We have many advantages over our competitors with strengths in our engineering, sourcing and operations capabilities as well as a global distribution network that we believe can be leveraged further for continued market share gains. We are also focused on expanding our addressable market opportunities by entering new markets, be it with new products or new geographies around the world.\nLead with natural gas power generation products.\nWe will attempt to gain incremental market share within commercial and industrial markets through our leading position in the growing market for cleaner burning, more cost effective natural gas fueled standby power solutions. Demand for these products continues to represent an increasing portion of the overall C&I market, which we believe will continue to increase at a faster rate than traditional diesel fueled generators as a result of their lower capital investment and operating costs. Given the abundance of natural gas as a global source for base-load power, we also intend to explore new gaseous generator related market opportunities, including increasing our product capabilities for applications beyond standby generation including continuous-duty, prime rated, distributed generation, demand response, micro grids and overall use as a distributed energy resource in areas where grid stability or capacity is needed. We plan to do this by leveraging our deep technical capabilities for gaseous-fueled products, leading position for natural gas standby generators and growing market acceptance for these products. As part of this strategy, we plan to continue to expand our natural gas product offering into larger power nodes to take advantage of the continuing shift from diesel to natural gas generators.\nConnect to monitor and manage energy technology products.\nWe will work to continue to diversify our business model from primarily “equipment centric” to a systems and services provider through connectivity solutions and subscription based applications deployed enterprise wide. This includes an important emphasis on improving the end-user experience, helping customers to lower utility costs and to help offset the purchase cost of our equipment over the product's lifespan. A critical focus continues to be increasing the connection with our products to unlock opportunities and revenue streams. We have developed and acquired tools and programs that add value to dealers, utilities, energy retailers and end-users that will result in recurring revenue from subscriptions and parts. We leverage data obtained from connected devices by developing predictive analytics that result in continuously improving product quality, sales processes and tools, energy optimization, aftermarket penetration, customer experience and alignment with dealers. Finally, we will continue to build or acquire energy management capabilities to monetize an ecosystem of devices that relate to energy use, storage, generation, control and optimization, including capitalizing on the future ability of these devices to be used as distributed energy resources in grid services applications around the world to help support the operational stability of electrical grids.\nExpansion globally is a core element to the success of each of our strategic objectives. The acquisitions completed over the past several years that now comprise our International segment have significantly increased our global presence by adding product, manufacturing and distribution capabilities that serve local markets around the world, and have resulted in us becoming a leading global player for backup power and mobile power equipment. As we look forward, we intend to leverage our increased international footprint attained from these acquisitions to serve the significant global markets for power generation, energy storage, monitoring and management, and grid services outside the U.S. and Canada.\n5\nSee “Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Business Drivers and Trends” for additional drivers that influence demand for our products and other trends affecting the markets that we serve.\nManufacturing\nWe operate numerous manufacturing plants, distribution facilities and inventory warehouses located throughout the world.

    "text": "You should carefully consider the following risks. These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us. These risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under “Forward-Looking Statements” and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n8\nRisk factors r\nelated to COVID-19\nThe duration and scope of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain and may continue to adversely affect our operations, supply chain, distribution, and demand for certain of our products and services.\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 has created significant uncertainty within the global markets that we serve. We have operations, customers and suppliers in countries significantly impacted by COVID-19. Governmental authorities around the world have taken a variety of measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans or restrictions, increased border controls or closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns and such authorities may impose additional restrictions in the future. We have also taken actions to protect our employees and to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 within our business. There can be no assurance that the measures implemented by governmental authorities or our own actions will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and our customers, as well as recent volatility in oil prices, has negatively impacted demand for certain of our products and is expected to continue to do so in the future. Its effects could also result in disruptions to our manufacturing operations and supply chain, which could negatively impact our ability to meet customer demand. Our forward-looking statements assume that our production facilities, supply chain and distribution partners continue to operate during the pandemic. To date, we have been able to operate the majority of our facilities given our status as an essential operation. If we were to encounter a significant work stoppage, disruption, or outbreak due to COVID-19 at one or more of our locations or suppliers, we may not be able to satisfy customer demand for a period of time.\nFurthermore, the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, demand for our products and impacts to our operations, including the measures taken by governmental authorities to address it, may precipitate or exacerbate other risks and/or uncertainties, including specifically many of the risk factors set forth in this Annual Report, including risks related to the fair market value of intangible assets that could lead to an impairment, which may have a significant impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition, although we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time.\nRisk factors r\nelated to our business and industry\nDemand for\nthe majority of\nour products is significantl\ny affected by unpredictable\npower\noutage\nactivity\nthat can lead to substantial variations in, and uncertainties regarding, our financial results from period to period.\nSales of our products are subject to consumer buying patterns, and demand for the majority of our products is affected by power outage events caused by thunderstorms, hurricanes, ice storms, blackouts, public safety power shutoffs, and other power grid reliability issues. The impact of these outage events on our sales can vary depending on the location, frequency and severity of the outages. Sustained periods without major power disruptions can lead to reduced consumer awareness of the benefits of standby and portable generator products and can result in reduced sales growth rates and excess inventory. There are smaller, more localized power outages that occur frequently that drive a baseline level of demand for back-up power solutions. The lack of major power outage events and fluctuations to the baseline levels of power outage activity are part of managing our business, and these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales and profits. Despite their unpredictable nature, we believe power disruptions create awareness and accelerate adoption for our home standby products.\nDemand for our products is significantly affected by durable goods spending by consumers and businesses\n,\nand other macroeconomic conditions.\nOur business is affected by general economic conditions, and uncertainty or adverse changes such as the prolonged downturn in U.S. residential investment and the impact of more stringent credit standards could lead to a decline in demand for our products and pressure to reduce our prices. Our sales of light-commercial and industrial generators are affected by conditions in the non-residential construction sector and by the capital investment trends for small and large businesses and municipalities. If these businesses and municipalities cannot access credit markets or do not utilize discretionary funds to purchase our products as a result of the economy or other factors, our business could suffer and our ability to realize benefits from our strategy of increasing sales in the light-commercial and industrial sectors through, among other things, our focus on innovation and product development, including natural gas engine and modular technology, could be adversely affected. In addition, consumer confidence and home remodeling expenditures have a significant impact on sales of our residential products, and prolonged periods of weakness in consumer durable goods spending could have a material impact on our business. Typically, we do not have contracts with our customers which call for committed volume, and we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to purchase our products at the same level, if at all. If general economic conditions or consumer confidence were to worsen, or if the non-residential construction sector or rate of capital investments were to decline, our net sales and profits would likely be adversely affected. Additionally, timing of capital spending by our national account customers can vary from quarter-to-quarter based on capital availability and internal capital spending budgets. Also, the availability of renewable energy mandates and investment tax credits and other subsidies can have an impact on the demand for energy storage systems.\nDecreases in the availability and quality, or increases in the cost, of raw materials\n,\nkey components\nand labor\nwe use to make our products could materially reduce our earnings.\nThe principal raw materials that we use to produce our products are steel, copper and aluminum. We also source a significant number of component parts from third parties that we utilize to manufacture our products. The prices of those raw materials and components are susceptible to significant fluctuations due to trends in supply and demand, commodity prices, currencies, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, price controls, economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances beyond our control. We do not have long-term supply contracts in place to ensure the raw materials and components we use are available in necessary amounts or at fixed prices. If we are unable to mitigate raw material or component price increases through product design improvements, price increases to our customers, manufacturing productivity improvements, or hedging transactions, our profitability could be adversely affected. Also, our ability to continue to obtain quality materials and components is subject to the continued reliability and viability of our suppliers, including in some cases, suppliers who are the sole source of certain important components. If we are unable to obtain adequate, cost efficient or timely deliveries of required raw materials and components, or sufficient labor resources while we ramp up production to meet higher levels of demand, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of products on a timely basis. This could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs, delay new product introductions or suffer harm to our reputation.\n9\nThe industry in which we compete is highly competitive, and our failure to compete successfully\ncould adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in markets that are highly competitive. Some of our competitors have established brands and are larger in size or are divisions of large diversified companies which have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Some of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower margins in order to compete with us. In addition, we could face new competition from large international or domestic companies with established industrial brands that enter our end markets. Demand for our products may also be affected by our ability to respond to changes in design and functionality, to respond to downward pricing pressure, and to provide shorter lead times for our products than our competitors. If we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures, we could lose market share, which could have an adverse impact on our results. For further information, see “Item 1—Business—Competition”.\nOur industry is subject to te\nchnological change, and our failure to continue developing new and improved products and to bring these products rapidly to market could have an adverse impact on our business.\nNew products, or refinements and improvements to our existing products, may have technical failures, delayed introductions, higher than expected production costs or may not be well accepted by our customers. If we are not able to anticipate, identify, develop and market high quality products in line with technological advancements that respond to changes in customer preferences, demand for our products could decline and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on independent dealers and distribution partners, and the loss of these dealers and distribution partners, or of any of our sales arrangements with significant private label,\nnational\n, retail or equipment rental customers, would adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to our direct sales force and manufacturer sales representatives, we depend on the services of independent distributors and dealers to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our end customers. We also rely upon our distribution channels to drive awareness for our product categories and our brands. In addition, we sell our products to end users through private label arrangements with leading home equipment, electrical equipment and construction machinery companies; arrangements with top retailers and equipment rental companies; and our direct national accounts with telecommunications and industrial customers. Our distribution agreements and any contracts we have with large national, retail and other customers are typically not exclusive, and many of the distributors with whom we do business offer competitors’ products and services. Impairment of our relationships with our distributors, dealers or large customers, loss of a substantial number of these distributors or dealers or of one or more large customers, or an increase in our distributors' or dealers' sales of our competitors' products to our customers or of our large customers' purchases of our competitors' products could materially reduce our sales and profits. Also, our ability to successfully realize our growth strategy is dependent in part on our ability to identify, attract and retain new distributors at all layers of our distribution platform, including increasing the number of energy storage distributors, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts. For further information, see “Item 1—Business—Distribution Channels and Customers”.\nOur business could be negatively impacted if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if third parties claim that we are in violation of their intellectual property rights.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights to be important assets, and seek to protect them through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing and confidentiality agreements. These protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, breaching any confidentiality agreements with us, copying or reverse engineering our products, or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business. Not only are intellectual property-related proceedings burdensome and costly, but they could span years to resolve and we might not ultimately prevail. We cannot guarantee that any patents, issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties. Moreover, the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products.\nIn addition, we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties' intellectual property rights. Any such claim, even if it is without merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to defend, subject us to damages, cause us to cease making, using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property, require us to redesign our products, divert management time and attention, and/or require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements.\nW\ne may incur costs and liabilities as a result o\nf product liability\nclaims.\nWe face a risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other damage. Although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. A significant unsuccessful product liability defense could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed. If our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our market share and pricing with respect to some of our products, which could reduce our sales and profitability.\n10\nWe are unable to determine the specific impact of changes in selling prices or changes in volumes\nor mix\nof our products on our net sales.\nBecause of the wide range of products that we sell, the level of customization for many of our products, the frequent rollout of new products, the different accounting systems utilized, and the fact that we do not apply pricing changes uniformly across our entire portfolio of products, we are unable to determine with specificity the effect of volume or mix changes or changes in selling prices on our net sales.\nPolicy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position.\nChanges in government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. Our business benefits from free trade agreements, and efforts to withdraw from, or substantially modify such agreements, in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs, import or export licensing requirements, exchange controls or new barriers to entry, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For example, starting in 2018 and continuing, we are experiencing increased tariffs on many of our products and product components, although these tariffs did not ultimately have a material adverse effect on our results due to the implementation of various mitigation efforts and temporary exclusions in conjunction with our supply chain and end market partners.\nAdditionally, the United Kingdom’s exit from European Union (EU) membership has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty. Although it is unknown what the terms of the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the EU will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and EU and increased regulatory complexities. Any of these factors could adversely impact customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our results of operations.\nRisk factors related to our operations\nThe loss of any key members of our senior management team or key employees could disrupt our operations and harm our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on the efforts of certain key individuals, including the members of our senior management team, who have significant experience in the power products industry. If, for any reason, our senior executives do not continue to be active in management, or if our key employees leave our company, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Failure to continue to attract these individuals at reasonable compensation levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and results of operations. Although we do not anticipate that we will have to replace any of these individuals in the near future, the loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDisruptions caused by labor dis\nputes or organized labor activities could harm our business.\nWe may from time to time experience union organizing activities in our non-union facilities. Disputes with the current labor union or new union organizing activities could lead to work slowdowns or stoppages and make it difficult or impossible for us to meet scheduled delivery times for product shipments to our customers, which could result in loss of business. In addition, union activity could result in higher labor costs, which could harm our financial condition, results of operations and competitive position. A work stoppage or limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, many of our suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n11\nWe may experience material disruptions to our manufacturing operations.\nWhile we seek to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable rules and regulations and take measures to minimize the risks of disruption at our facilities, a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively impact our financial results. Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our equipment within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:\nIn addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing and production facilities are located in Wisconsin within a 100-mile radius of each other. We could experience prolonged periods of reduced production due to unforeseen events occurring in or around our manufacturing facilities in Wisconsin. In the event of a business interruption at our facilities, in particular our Wisconsin facilities, we may be unable to shift manufacturing capabilities to alternate locations, accept materials from suppliers or meet customer shipment needs, among other severe consequences. Such an event could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition and results of our operations.\nWe are vulnerable to supply disruptions from single-sourced suppliers.\nWe single-source certain types of parts in our product designs. Any delay in our suppliers’ deliveries may impair our ability to deliver products to our customers. A wide variety of factors could cause such delays including, but not limited to, lack of capacity, economic downturns, availability of credit, logistical challenges, trade restrictions, weather events, disease or natural disasters.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant unexpected difficulties in integrating acquired businesses.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses with our business. The integration of independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. Further, integrating and managing businesses with international operations may pose challenges not previously experienced by our management. As a result, we may be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of any acquired businesses with ours. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, could preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating an acquired business into our existing operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, the overall integration of our acquired businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and diversion of management's attention, and may cause our stock price to decline. The difficulties of combining the operations of acquired businesses with ours include, among others:\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if the operations of our acquired businesses are integrated successfully with our operations, we may not realize the full benefits of the transaction, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Or, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our businesses. All of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition, and cause a decrease in the price of our common stock. As a result, we cannot assure you that the combination of our acquisitions with our business will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transaction.\n12\nA significant portion of our purchased components are sourced in foreign countries, exposing us to additional risks that may not exist in the United States.\nWe source a significant portion of our purchased components overseas, primarily in Asia and Europe. Our international sourcing subjects us to a number of potential risks in addition to the risks associated with third-party sourcing generally. Such risks include:\nThese factors may have an adverse effect on our ability to efficiently and cost effectively source our purchased components overseas. In particular, if the U.S. dollar were to depreciate significantly against the currencies in which we purchase raw materials from foreign suppliers, our cost of goods sold could increase materially, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisk factors related to legal and regulatory matters\nAs a U.S. corporation that conducts business in\na variety of foreign countries\n, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice\ns Act and a variety of anti-corruption laws worldwide. A determination that we violated any of these laws may affect our business and operations adversely.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. The United Kingdom Bribery Act (UKBA) prohibits domestic and foreign bribery of the private sector as well as public officials. Any determination that we have violated any anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and non-compliance with or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs, fines, sanctions and claims.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations including those governing, among other things, emissions to air; discharges to water; noise; and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. In addition, under federal and state environmental laws, we could be required to investigate, remediate and/or monitor the effects of the release or disposal of materials both at sites associated with past and present operations and at third-party sites where wastes generated by our operations were disposed. This liability may be imposed retroactively and whether or not we caused, or had any knowledge of, the existence of these materials and may result in our paying more than our fair share of the related costs. We could also be subject to a recall action by regulatory authorities. Violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs, fines and civil or criminal proceedings or personal injury and workers' compensation claims.\nOur products are subject to substantial government regulation.\nOur products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing, among other things, emissions, noise, labeling, transport, product content, and data privacy, including standards imposed by the EPA, CARB and other regulatory agencies around the world. Also, as we increase our connectivity with our products and customers, we may be required to comply with additional data privacy and cybersecurity regulations. These laws are constantly evolving and many are becoming increasingly stringent. Changes in applicable laws or regulations, or in the enforcement thereof, could require us to redesign our products and could adversely affect our business or financial condition in the future. Developing and marketing products to meet such new requirements could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in some markets. In some cases, we may be required to modify our products or develop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to air emissions and carbon monoxide. Typically, additional costs associated with significant compliance modifications are passed on to the market. While we have been able to meet previous deadlines and requirements, failure to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards could adversely affect our position in the markets we serve.\n13\nRisk factors related to cybersecurity\nFailures or security breaches of our networks or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business\n.\nWe rely heavily on information technology (IT) both in our products and services for customers and in our IT systems used to run our business. Further, we collect and store sensitive information in our data centers and on our networks. Government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers, cyber-criminals, malicious insiders and other actors targeting confidential information and all types of IT systems. These actors may engage in fraudulent activities, theft of confidential or proprietary information and sabotage or ransomware.\nOur IT systems, our connected products, and our confidential information may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of attacks including computer viruses, worms or other malicious software programs. The risk of such attacks may increase as we integrate newly acquired companies or develop new connected products and related software. These attacks pose a risk to the security of our products, systems and networks and those of our customers, suppliers and third-party service providers, as well as to the confidentiality of our information and the integrity and availability of our data. While we attempt to mitigate these risks through board oversight, controls, due diligence, employee training and communication, third party intrusion testing, system hardening, email and web filters, regular patching, surveillance, encryption, and other measures, we remain vulnerable to information security threats.\nDespite the precautions we take, an intrusion or infection of our systems or connected products could result in the disruption of our business, or a loss of proprietary or confidential information. Similarly, an attack on our IT systems or connected products could result in theft or disclosure of trade secrets or other intellectual property, a breach of confidential customer or employee information, or product failure or misuse. Any such events could have an adverse impact on sales, harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns. As the threats evolve and become more potent, we may incur additional costs to secure the products that we sell, as well as our data and infrastructure of networks and devices.\nRisk factors related to our capital structure\nWe hav\ne\nindebtedness which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to make payments on our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2020 we had total indebtedness of $885.2 million. Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. While we maintain interest rate swaps covering a portion of our outstanding debt, our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because debt under our credit facilities bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR or other base rate. In connection with our term loan amendment in December 2019, language was added to the agreement to include a benchmark replacement rate, selected by the administrative agent and the borrower, as a replacement to LIBOR that would take affect at the time LIBOR ceases. The Company plans to work with its lenders in the near future to amend other LIBOR based debt agreements to add a replacement rate should the use of LIBOR cease. If we do not have sufficient earnings to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell securities, none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do.\nThe terms of our credit facilities restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions.\nOur credit facilities contain, and any future indebtedness of ours or our subsidiaries would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, including limitations on our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long-term interests. These restrictions set limitations on, among other things, our ability to:\nThe operating and financial restrictions in our credit facilities and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. A breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities would result in a default. If any such default occurs, the lenders under our credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable, or enforce their security interest, any of which would result in an event of default. The lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. Our existing credit facilities do not contain any financial maintenance covenants.\n14\nWe may need additional capital to finance our growth strategy or to refinance our existing credit facilities, and we may not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms, or at all, which may limit ou\nr ability to grow.\nWe may require additional financing to expand our business. Financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable. The terms of our senior secured credit facilities limit our ability to incur additional debt. In addition, economic conditions, including a downturn in the credit markets, could impact our ability to finance our growth on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain capital on acceptable terms, we may have to delay, modify or abandon some or all of our growth strategies. In the future, if we are unable to refinance our credit facilities on acceptable terms, our liquidity could be adversely affected.\nOur total assets include goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles. If we determine these have become impaired,\nour\nnet income could be materially adversely affected.\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Indefinite-lived intangibles are comprised of certain tradenames. At December 31, 2020, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles totaled $983.6 million. We review goodwill and other intangibles at least annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the statement of comprehensive income. Future impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of an acquired business or product line, adverse market conditions and changes in the competitive landscape, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of an acquired business or product line, and a variety of other circumstances including any of the risk factors noted above. A reduction in net income resulting from the write-down or impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.

    "text": "The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “Item 1 – Business,” the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements, based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance, that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under “Item 1A - Risk Factors.”\nOverview\nWe are a leading global designer and manufacturer of a wide range of energy technology solutions. The Company provides power generation equipment, energy storage systems, grid services solutions, and other power products serving the residential, light commercial and industrial markets.\nPower generation and storage is a key focus of the Company, which differentiates us from our competitors who also have broad operations outside of the power equipment market. As the only significant market participant with a primary focus on these products, we maintain one of the leading market positions in the power equipment market in North America and an expanding presence internationally. We believe we have one of the widest ranges of products in the marketplace, including residential, commercial and industrial standby generators; as well as portable and mobile generators used in a variety of applications. A key strategic focus for the Company in recent years has been leveraging our leading position in the growing market for cleaner burning, more cost-effective natural gas fueled generators to expand into applications beyond standby power, allowing us to participate in distributed generation projects. The Company in recent years has been evolving its business model to also focus on clean energy products, solutions, and services. In 2019, we began providing energy storage systems as a clean energy solution for residential use that capture and store electricity from solar panels or other power sources and help reduce home energy costs while also protecting homes from shorter-duration power outages. During 2020, we entered the market for grid services involving distributed energy optimization and control software that helps support the operational stability of the world's power grids. We have also been focused on connecting the equipment we manufacture to the users of that equipment, helping to drive additional value to our customers and our distribution partners over the product lifecycle. The strategic focus on expanding the connectivity of our products will broaden our monitoring capabilities and also enable the increasing utilization of this equipment as distributed energy resources as the nascent market for grid-services expands over the next several years. Overall, as the traditional centralized utility model evolves over time, we believe that a cleaner, more decentralized grid infrastructure will build-out, and Generac's energy technology solutions are strategically positioned to participate in this future \"Grid 2.0\".\nIn addition to power generation and storage solutions, other products that we design and manufacture include light towers which provide temporary lighting for various end markets, and a broad and growing product line of outdoor power equipment for residential and commercial use.\n18\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business\nThe global outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020 and has negatively affected the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant market volatility and uncertainty. Our management team has been very proactive in addressing the impact of COVID-19 on our business. The situation continues to evolve, and we are working to ensure employee safety, monitor customer demand, proactively address supply chain or production challenges, and support our communities during this challenging time. We manufacture and provide essential products and services to a variety of critical infrastructure customers around the globe, and as a result, substantially all of our operations and production activities have, to-date, been operational. We have implemented changes in our work practices, maintaining a safe working environment for production and office employees at our facilities, while enabling other employees to productively work from home.\nThe further extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business is dependent on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic, our ability to operate during the pandemic, actions taken by domestic and foreign governments to contain the spread of the virus, and the related length of its impact on the global economy and our customers.\nDemand\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty within various global markets that we serve. Several areas of our business have been and may continue to be negatively impacted, in particular our Commercial and Industrial (C&I) products around the world. The decline in oil prices has impacted our C&I mobile products demand significantly as national rental customers are deferring their capital spending. C&I stationary product shipments through our North American distributor channel and our Telecom customers have slowed during 2020 due to declines in quoting activity. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a broad-based sharp drop in global demand for our C&I products in our International segment, which magnified the slower economic growth and geopolitical headwinds that were already being experienced by our international business. Given the magnitude of the downturn in demand for C&I products, we initiated a number of meaningful cost-cutting actions for this part of our business during the second quarter of 2020 to better align our cost structure with customer demand. We are continuing to monitor these negative impacts on our C&I product demand closely and may implement additional measures in response.\nWith regard to our Residential products, historical experience and our current year results have shown that demand for Residential products can decouple from broader economic trends as these products are largely driven by power outages. The aging and underinvested electrical grid in the U.S. continues to be more vulnerable to elevated power outages across the country. As the vast majority of U.S. citizens are spending much more time at home due to the pandemic, it is becoming more essential to have a backup power strategy, especially as homeowners are doing more critical activities like working and learning from home. In addition, with California emerging as a major market for back-up power and our entrance into clean energy, these incremental growth drivers have helped to more than offset the impact of lower consumer spending due to COVID-19.\nSupply Chain and Operations\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement numerous and constantly evolving measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limits on gatherings, quarantines, and business shutdowns. While we are deemed an essential, critical infrastructure business and our facilities currently remain operational, this continues to be a fluid process and subject to change. We have experienced and may continue to experience increased employee absences at several of our production facilities. If we were to encounter a significant work stoppage, disruption, or COVID-19 outbreak at one or more of our locations or suppliers, we may not be able to satisfy customer demand for a period of time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global supply chain and we are continually monitoring scheduled material receipts to mitigate any delays. To date, we have not experienced significant impacts or interruptions to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but this could be subject to change if one or more of our suppliers can no longer operate in this environment. We have maintained business continuity by utilizing safety stock inventory levels and executing air freight strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted the global logistics network. Although we have experienced inbound and outbound logistics delays and increased costs in moving shipments across several regions, the impact to our business thus far has not been significant. This could change if freight carriers are delayed or not able to operate.\nLiquidity\nAlthough the COVID-19 outbreak has created uncertain market conditions, we believe our business model, current cash balance, projected cash flow generation, and availability under our ABL credit facility provide us with a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. This financial strength allows us, notwithstanding unforeseen impacts of the current COVID-19 pandemic, to remain focused on our strategic plan and provides the flexibility to continue to invest in future growth opportunities.\n19\nBusiness D\nrivers\nand Operational Factors\nIn operating our business and monitoring its performance, we pay attention to a number of business drivers and trends as well as operational factors. The statements in this section are based on our current expectations.\nBusiness\nDrivers and T\nrends\nOur performance is affected by the demand for reliable power generation products, energy storage systems, grid services solutions, and other power products by our customer base. This demand is influenced by several important drivers and trends affecting our industry, including the following:\nKey Mega-trends:\nThere are some important mega-trends that we believe represent major themes that will drive significant secular growth opportunities across our business over the long term. “Grid 2.0”, which is the evolution of the traditional electrical utility model, includes the decentralization and de-carbonization of the grid and a migration toward distributed energy resources that is expected to drive demand for a variety of clean energy and grid services solutions going forward.  Attitudes around global warming and climate change are shifting, which includes the expectation of more severe weather driving increased power outage activity.  Natural gas is expected to be a key fuel of the future with the abundance of supply globally leading to increasing demand for natural gas generators in applications beyond standby power.  The legacy infrastructure is in need of a major investment cycle to rebuild and upgrade aging networks and systems including transportation, water and power.  The wireless telecommunications infrastructure is shifting to the next generation “5G” architecture, which will enable new technologies requiring significant improvement in network uptime through backup power solutions.\nThe onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 has led to a new and emerging mega-trend that we refer to as “Home as a Sanctuary,” where millions of people are working, learning, shopping, entertaining, and in general, spending more time at home.  As working adults spend much more time working from home and school-age children learning from home, they become more sensitive to power outages due to lost productivity.  These trends combined with ongoing elevated power outage activity has led to a significant increased awareness, importance and need for backup power security.  As a result of spending more time at home, homeowners are also investing more into home improvement projects and outdoor project activity, which is leading to increased and broad-based demand for home standby generators as well as chore products used in a variety of property maintenance applications.\nIncreasing penetration opportunity.\nMany potential customers are still not aware of the costs and benefits of automatic backup power solutions. We estimate that penetration rates for home standby generators are still only approximately 5.0% of the addressable market of homes in the United States. The decision to purchase backup power for many light-commercial buildings such as convenience stores, restaurants and gas stations is more return-on-investment driven and, as a result, these applications have relatively lower penetration rates as compared to buildings used in code-driven or mission critical applications such as hospitals, wastewater treatment facilities, 911 call centers, data centers and certain industrial locations. The emergence of lower cost, cleaner burning natural gas fueled generators has helped to increase the penetration of standby generators over the past decade in the light-commercial market. In addition, the installed base of backup power for telecommunications infrastructure is still increasing due to a variety of factors, including the impending rollout of next-generation 5G wireless networks enabling new technologies and the growing importance for critical communications being transmitted over wireless networks. We believe by expanding our distribution network, continuing to develop our product lines, and targeting our marketing efforts, we can continue to build awareness and increase penetration for our standby generators for residential, commercial and industrial purposes.\nEffect of large scale\nand baseline\npower disruptions.\nPower disruptions are an important driver of customer awareness for back-up power and have historically influenced demand for generators, both in the United States and internationally. Increased frequency and duration of major power outage events, that have a broader impact beyond a localized level, increases product awareness and may drive consumers to accelerate their purchase of a standby or portable generator during the immediate and subsequent period, which we believe may last for six to twelve months following a major power outage event for standby generators. For example, there have been a number of major outage events that occurred over the past decade that drove strong demand for portable and home standby generators, and the increased awareness of these products contributed to strong revenue growth in both the year they occurred along with the following subsequent year. Major power disruptions are unpredictable by nature and, as a result, our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period. In addition, there are smaller, more localized power outages that occur frequently across the United States that drive the baseline level of demand for back-up power solutions. The level of baseline power outage activity occurring across the United States can also fluctuate, and may cause our financial results to fluctuate from year to year.\nEnergy storage and monitoring markets developing quickly.\nDuring 2019, we entered the rapidly developing energy storage, monitoring and management markets with the acquisitions of Pika Energy and Neurio Technologies, along with the subsequent introduction of complete energy storage systems - marketed under the names PWRcell™ and PWRview™. We believe the electric utility landscape will undergo significant changes in the decade ahead as a result of rising utility rates, grid instability and power quality issues, environmental concerns, and the continuing performance and cost improvements in renewable energy and batteries. On-site power generation from solar, wind, geothermal, and natural gas generators is projected to become more prevalent as will the need to monitor, manage, and store this power – potentially developing into a significant market opportunity. The capabilities provided by Pika and Neurio have enabled us to bring an efficient and intelligent energy-savings solution to the energy storage and monitoring markets, which enabled us to quickly ramp shipments for these clean energy solutions during 2020, and we believe will position Generac as a key participant going forward. Although different from the emergency backup power space, we believe this market will develop similarly as the home standby generator market has over the past two decades given both products can provide power resiliency to homeowners. We expect to further advance our growing capabilities for energy storage systems including product development, sourcing, distribution, and marketing, as we leverage our significant competencies in the residential standby generator market to accelerate our market position in the emerging residential energy storage, monitoring and management markets.\nCalifornia market for backup power increasing.\nOver the past two years, utilities in the state of California have executed a number of Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) events in large portions of their service areas. These events were pro-active measures to prevent their equipment from potentially causing catastrophic wildfires during the dry and windy season of the year. The occurrence of these events, along with the utilities warning these actions could continue in the future as they upgrade their transmission and distribution infrastructure, have resulted in significant awareness and increased demand for our generators in California, where penetration rates of home standby generators still stand at only approximately 1%. We have a significant focus on expanding distribution in California and are working together with local regulators, inspectors, and gas utilities to increase their bandwidth and sense of urgency around approving and providing the infrastructure necessary for home standby and other backup power products. Our efforts in this part of the country will also be helpful in developing the market for energy storage and monitoring where the installed base of solar and other renewable sources of electricity are some of the highest in the U.S., and the regulatory environment is increasingly mandating renewable energy on new construction applications.\n20\nImpact of residential investment cycle.\nThe market for residential generators and energy storage systems is also affected by the residential investment cycle and overall consumer confidence and sentiment. When homeowners are confident of their household income, the value of their home and overall net worth, they are more likely to invest in their home. These trends can have an impact on demand for residential generators and energy storage systems. Trends in the new housing market, highlighted by residential housing starts, can also impact demand for these products. Demand for outdoor power equipment is also impacted by several of these factors, as well as weather precipitation patterns. Finally, the existence of renewable energy mandates and investment tax credits and other subsidies can also have an impact on the demand for energy storage systems.\nImpact of business capital investment and other economic cycle\ns\n.\nThe global market for our commercial and industrial products is affected by different capital investment cycles, which can vary across the numerous regions around the world in which we participate. These markets include non-residential building construction, durable goods and infrastructure spending, as well as investments in the exploration and production of oil & gas, as businesses or organizations either add new locations or make investments to upgrade existing locations or equipment. These trends can have a material impact on demand for these products. The capital investment cycle may differ for the various commercial and industrial end markets that we serve including light commercial, retail, office, telecommunications, industrial, data centers, healthcare, construction, oil & gas and municipal infrastructure, among others. The market for these products is also affected by general economic and geopolitical conditions as well as credit availability in the geographic regions that we serve.\nF\nactors\nAffecting Results of O\nperations\nWe are subject to various factors that can affect our results of operations, which we attempt to mitigate through factors we can control, including continued product development, expanded distribution, pricing, cost control and hedging. Certain operational and other factors that affect our business include the following:\nEffect of commodity, currency and component price fluctuations.\nIndustry-wide price fluctuations of key commodities, such as steel, copper and aluminum, along with other components we use in our products, as well as changes in labor costs required to produce our products, can have a material impact on our results of operations. Acquisitions in recent years have further expanded our commercial and operational presence outside of the United States. These international acquisitions, along with our existing global supply chain, expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and regulatory tariffs that can also have a material impact on our results of operations.\nWe have historically attempted to mitigate the impact of any inflationary pressures through improved product design and sourcing, manufacturing efficiencies, price increases and select hedging transactions. Our results are also influenced by changes in fuel prices in the form of freight rates, which in some cases are accepted by our customers and in other cases are paid by us.\nSeasonality.\nAlthough there is demand for our products throughout the year, in each of the past five years, approximately 19% to 21% of our net sales occurred in the first quarter, 22% to 25% in the second quarter, 26% to 28% in the third quarter and 27% to 31% in the fourth quarter, with different seasonality depending primarily on the occurrence, timing and severity of major power outage activity in each year. Major outage activity is unpredictable by nature and, as a result, our sales levels and profitability may fluctuate from period to period. The seasonality experienced during a major power outage, and for the subsequent quarters following the event, will vary relative to other periods where no major outage events occurred.\nDuring 2020, elevated power outage activity and the emergence of the \"Home as a Sanctuary\" trend driven by the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant increase in demand for home standby generators.  This increased demand has resulted in extended lead times for these products as of December 31, 2020, and as a result, our net sales during 2021 are expected to be more level-loaded throughout the year relative to historical seasonal patterns.\nFactors influencing interest\nexpense\n.\nInterest expense can be impacted by a variety of factors, including market fluctuations in LIBOR, interest rate election periods, interest rate swap agreements, repayments or borrowings of indebtedness, and amendments to our credit agreements. In connection with our term loan amendment in December 2019, language was added to the agreement to include a benchmark replacement rate, selected by the administrative agent and the borrower, as a replacement to LIBOR that would take affect at the time LIBOR ceases. We plan to work with our lenders in the future to amend other LIBOR based debt agreements to add a replacement rate should the use of LIBOR cease. Interest expense decreased during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower LIBOR rates and lower outstanding borrowings. Refer to Note 12, “Credit Agreements,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nFactors influencing provision for income taxes and cash\nincome\ntaxes paid.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. Since enactment, the U.S. Treasury Department (Treasury) issued several new regulations and other guidance which we have incorporated into our final tax calculations.\n21\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $102 million of tax-deductible goodwill and intangible asset amortization remaining from our acquisition by CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC in 2006. This remaining balance will fully amortize in our 2021 tax return, resulting in approximately $26 million of cash tax savings during 2021. Beginning in 2022, this tax amortization will no longer exist, resulting in a higher cash tax obligation on a go-forward basis.\nComponents of Net Sales and E\nxpenses\nNet\nS\nales\nOur net sales primarily consist of product sales to our customers. This includes sales of our power generation equipment, energy storage systems, and other power products to the residential, light commercial and industrial markets, as well as service parts to our dealer network. Net sales also include shipping and handling charges billed to customers, with the related freight costs included in cost of goods sold. Additionally, we offer other services, including extended warranties, remote monitoring, grid optimization, installation and maintenance services. However, these services accounted for less than two percent of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 2, “Summary of Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our revenue streams and related revenue recognition accounting policies.\nWe are not dependent on any one channel or customer for our net sales, with no single customer representing more than 6% of our sales, and our top ten customers representing less than 24% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCosts of Goods S\nold\nThe principal elements of costs of goods sold are component parts, raw materials, freight, factory overhead and labor. Component parts and raw materials comprised approximately 75% of costs of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2020. The principal component parts are engines, alternators, and batteries. We design and manufacture air-cooled engines for certain of our generators up to 24kW, along with certain liquid-cooled, natural gas engines. We source engines for certain of our smaller products and all of our diesel products. For certain natural gas engines, we source the base engine block, and then add a significant amount of value engineering, sub-systems and other content to the point that we are recognized as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of those engines. We design and manufacture many of the alternators for our units. We also manufacture other generator components where we believe we have a design and cost advantage. We source component parts from an extensive global network of reliable, high quality suppliers. In some cases, these relationships are proprietary.\nThe principal raw materials used in the manufacturing process that are sourced are steel, copper and aluminum. We are susceptible to fluctuations in the cost of these commodities, impacting our costs of goods sold. We seek to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on our business through a continued focus on global sourcing, product design improvements, manufacturing efficiencies, price increases and select hedging transactions. We are also impacted by foreign currency fluctuations given our global supply chain. There is typically a lag between raw material price fluctuations and their effect on our costs of goods sold.\nOther sources of costs include our manufacturing and warehousing facilities, factory overhead, labor and shipping costs. Factory overhead includes utilities, insurance, support personnel, depreciation, general supplies, support and maintenance. Although we attempt to maintain a flexible manufacturing cost structure, our margins can be impacted when we cannot timely adjust labor and manufacturing costs to match fluctuations in net sales.\nOperating E\nxpenses\nOur operating expenses consist of costs incurred to support our sales, marketing, distribution, service parts, engineering, information systems, human resources, accounting, finance, risk management, legal and tax functions, among others. These expenses include personnel costs such as salaries, bonuses, employee benefit costs, taxes, and share-based compensation cost, and are classified into three categories: selling and service, research and development, and general and administrative. Additionally, the amortization expense related to our finite-lived intangible assets is included within operating expenses.\n22\nSelling and service.\nOur selling and service expenses consist primarily of personnel expense, marketing expense, standard assurance warranty expense and other sales expenses. Our personnel expense recorded in selling and services expenses includes the expense of our sales force responsible for our broad customer base and other personnel involved in the marketing, sales and service of our products. Standard warranty expense, which is recorded at the time of sale, is estimated based on historical trends. Our marketing expenses include direct mail costs, printed material costs, product display costs, market research expenses, trade show expenses, media advertising, promotional expenses and co-op advertising costs. Marketing expenses are generally related to the launch of new product offerings, participation in trade shows and other events, opportunities to create market awareness for our products, and general brand awareness marketing efforts.\nResearch and\ndevelopment.\nOur research and development expenses support numerous projects covering all of our product lines. They also support our connectivity, remote monitoring, and energy monitoring initiatives. We operate engineering facilities with extensive capabilities at many locations globally and employ over 500 personnel with focus on new product development, existing product improvement and cost containment. We are committed to research and development, and rely on a combination of patents and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nGeneral and administrative.\nOur general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for general and administrative employees; accounting, legal and professional services fees; information technology costs; insurance; travel and entertainment expense; and other corporate expenses.\nAmortization of intangibles.\nOur amortization of intangibles expense includes the straight-line amortization of finite-lived tradenames, customer lists, patents and technology, and other intangibles assets.\nOther\n(Expense) Income\nOther (expense) income includes the interest expense on our outstanding borrowings, amortization of debt financing costs and original issue discount, and cash flows related to interest rate swap agreements. Other (expense) income also includes other financial items such as losses on extinguishment of debt, loss on pension settlement, and investment income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.\nResults of O\nperations\nA detailed discussion of the year-over-year changes from the Company's fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019 can be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of the Company's fiscal 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 25, 2020.\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the periods indicated:\n23\nThe following sets forth our reportable segment information for the periods indicated:\nThe following table sets forth our product class information for the periods indicated:\nNet sales\n.\nThe increase in Domestic segment sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to strong growth in shipments of home standby generators and portable generators as elevated outage activity and nationwide stay-at-home orders heightened consumer awareness of power reliability concerns. Chore products sold directly to consumers were also strong during the current year as homeowners increased outdoor project activity. In addition, shipments of the PWRcell™ energy storage system had a strong impact on growth as we expanded our presence in the rapidly developing solar-plus-storage market. This broad-based residential products growth was partially offset by continued weakness in sales of C&I mobile products due to the ongoing impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lower shipments of C&I products to national telecom customers as compared to a strong prior year comparison.\nThe decrease in International segment sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by a broad-based sharp drop in global demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the C&I power generation market in certain key regions of the world, which magnified the slower economic growth and geopolitical headwinds already being experienced prior to the pandemic. However, the year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter was at a notably lesser rate relative to recent quarters as certain regions are beginning to show signs of recovery.\nTotal contribution from non-annualized recent acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $32.4 million.\nNet income attributable to Generac\nHoldings Inc.\nNet income attributable to Generac Holdings Inc. was $350.6 million as compared to $252.0 million in the prior year period. The current year net income includes $11.5 million of pre-tax charges taken in the second quarter of 2020 relating to business optimization, restructuring, and other costs to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the decline in oil prices on end markets for our products. The cost reduction actions taken include certain headcount reductions, non-cash asset write-downs, and other charges. The charges, which primarily relate to C&I products, consist of $6.3 million classified within costs of goods sold and $5.2 million classified within operating expenses.\nGross profit.\nGross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 38.5% compared to 36.2% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The overall increase in gross profit margin reflected a favorable sales mix towards significantly higher shipments of residential products, along with a lower mix of C&I products. The current year period includes the impact of the aforementioned $6.3 million of charges classified within costs of goods sold.\nOperating expenses.\nOperating expenses increased $53.0 million, or 12.4%, as compared to the prior year. The current year period includes the impact of the aforementioned $5.2 million of charges classified within operating expenses. In addition, the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by higher variable expenses from the significant increase in sales volume, incremental spend related to clean energy products and the impact of acquisitions, higher employee costs, and additional intangible amortization. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses as a result of the restructuring actions initiated in the second quarter of 2020 and an overall reduction in controllable operating expenses.\nOther expense.\nThe decrease in other expense, net was driven by a reduction in interest expense due to lower LIBOR rates and lower outstanding borrowings in the current year, as well as a $10.9 million pre-tax settlement charge related to the termination of the Company’s domestic pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nProvision for i\nncome tax\nes\n.\nThe effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 22.2% and 21.1%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a reduction in the prior year U.S. state income tax expense, which did not repeat in the current year, as well as higher earnings in the current year, which dilute the impact of discrete tax benefits.\nAdjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined in, and there is a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Company in, \"Non-GAAP Measures - Adjusted EBITDA\" included below in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the Domestic segment for the year ended December 31, 2020 were 27.0% of net sales as compared to 24.6% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the current year benefited from favorable sales mix and higher operating leverage from the significant revenue growth, partially offset by the aforementioned higher operating expense investments.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins for the International segment, before deducting for non-controlling interests, for the year ended December 31, 2020 were 5.1% of net sales as compared to 5.5% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019. Decreased operating leverage on lower sales volumes was the primary contributor to the margin decline, partially offset by lower operating expenses as a result of the restructuring activities initiated in the second quarter of 2020.\nAdjusted net income\n.\nAdjusted Net Income is defined in, and there is a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted Net Income attributable to the Company in, \"Non-GAAP Measures - Adjusted Net Income\" included below in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Adjusted Net Income of $412.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased 29.7% from $317.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to the factors outlined above together with an increase in the cash income tax rate from 15.0% in 2019 to 17.9% in 2020.\n24\nLiquidity and Financial P\nosition\nOur primary cash requirements include payment for our raw material and component supplies, salaries & benefits, facility and lease costs, operating expenses, interest and principal payments on our debt and capital expenditures. We finance our operations primarily through cash flow generated from operations and, if necessary, borrowings under our ABL credit facility (ABL Facility).\nOur credit agreements originally provided for a $1.2 billion term loan B credit facility (Term Loan) and include a $300.0 million uncommitted incremental term loan facility. The Term Loan currently matures on December 13, 2026 and bears interest at rates based upon either a base rate plus an applicable margin of 0.75% or adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 1.75%. The Term Loan does not require an Excess Cash Flow payment if our secured leverage ratio is maintained below 3.75 to 1.00 times. As of December 31, 2020, our secured leverage ratio was 1.12 to 1.00 times, and we were in compliance with all covenants of the Term Loan. There are no financial maintenance covenants on the Term Loan.\nOur credit agreements also provide for the $300.0 million ABL Facility, which matures on June 12, 2023. As of December 31, 2020, there was no outstanding balance under the ABL Facility, leaving $299.6 million of availability, net of outstanding letters of credit. We were in compliance with all covenants of the ABL Facility as of December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $954.7 million of liquidity comprised of $655.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $299.6 million available under our ABL Facility. Additionally, we have no maturities on our Term Loan until December 2026. We believe we have a strong liquidity position that allows us, notwithstanding unforeseen impacts of the current COVID-19 pandemic, to execute our strategic plan and provides the flexibility to continue to invest in future growth opportunities.\nIn September 2018, our Board of Directors approved a $250.0 million stock repurchase program, which expired in October 2020. In September 2020, the Board of Directors approved another stock repurchase program, which commenced on October 27, 2020, and under which we may repurchase $250.0 million of common stock over 24 months from time to time, in amounts and at prices we deem appropriate, subject to market conditions and other considerations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, no repurchases were made. Since the inception of all stock repurchase programs starting in August 2015, we have repurchased 8,676,706 shares of our common stock for $305.5 million (an average repurchase price of $35.21 per share), all funded with cash on hand.\nLong-term L\niquidity\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and availability under our ABL Facility and other short-term lines of credit provide us with sufficient capital to continue to grow our business in the future. We may use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest and principal on our outstanding debt, as well as repurchase shares of our common stock, impacting the amount available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. As we continue to expand our business, we may require additional capital to fund working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions.\nCash F\nlow\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows by category for the periods presented:\nThe increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher sales volumes and resulting higher operating earnings in the current year, as well as a significant working capital investment that was made in the prior year which did not repeat in the current year.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily represented cash payments of $64.8 million related to the acquisition of businesses and $62.1 million for the purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily consisted of cash payments of $112.0 million related to the acquisition of businesses and $60.8 million for the purchase of property and equipment.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily consisted of $282.5 million of debt repayments ($277.7 million of short-term borrowings and $4.8 million of long-term borrowings), $14.9 million of taxes paid related to equity awards, and $4.0 million of contingent consideration for acquired businesses. These payments were partially offset by $257.9 million cash proceeds from borrowings ($257.6 million for short-term borrowings and $0.3 million for long-term borrowings) and $13.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily consisted of $112.6 million of debt repayments ($53.1 million of long-term borrowings and $59.5 million of short-term borrowings), $6.4 million of taxes paid related to equity awards, and $5.5 million of contingent consideration for acquired businesses. These payments were partially offset by $75.0 million of cash proceeds from borrowings ($73.3 million for short-term borrowings and $1.7 million for long-term borrowings) and $9.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\n25\nSenior Secured Credit F\nacilities\nRefer to Note 12, “Credit Agreements,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 and the “Liquidity and Financial Position” section included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the senior secured credit facilities.\nCovenant C\nompliance\nThe Term Loan contains restrictions on the Company’s ability to pay distributions and dividends. Payments can be made to the Company or other parent companies for certain expenses such as operating expenses in the ordinary course, fees and expenses related to any debt or equity offering and to pay franchise or similar taxes. Dividends can be used to repurchase equity interests, subject to limitations in certain circumstances. Additionally, the Term Loan restricts the aggregate amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid and, in certain circumstances, requires pro forma compliance with certain fixed charge coverage ratios or gross leverage ratios, as applicable, in order to pay certain dividends and distributions. The Term Loan also contains other affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness, liens on property, sale and leaseback transactions, investments, loans and advances, mergers or consolidations, asset sales, acquisitions, transactions with affiliates, prepayments of certain other indebtedness and modifications of our organizational documents. The Term Loan does not contain any financial maintenance covenants.\nThe Term Loan contains customary events of default, including, among others, nonpayment of principal, interest or other amounts, failure to perform covenants, inaccuracy of representations or warranties in any material respect, cross-defaults with other material indebtedness, certain undischarged judgments, the occurrence of certain ERISA, bankruptcy or insolvency events, or the occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the Term Loan). A bankruptcy or insolvency event of default will cause the obligations under the Term Loan to automatically become immediately due and payable.\nThe ABL Facility also contains covenants and events of default substantially similar to those in the Term Loan, as described above.\nContractual O\nbligations\nThe following table summarizes our expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020, using the interest rates in effect as of that date:\n(1) The Term Loan matures on December 13, 2026. The ABL Facility provides for a $300.0 million senior secured ABL revolving credit facility, which matures on June 12, 2023. There was no outstanding balance on the ABL Facility as of December 31, 2020.\nCapital E\nxpenditures\nOur operations require capital expenditures for facilities and related improvements, technology, research & development, tooling, equipment, capacity expansion, IT systems & infrastructure and upgrades. Capital expenditures were $62.1 million, $60.8 million, and $47.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and were funded through cash from operations.\nAs a result of increased demand for our products and in order to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity, we have entered into an agreement to purchase an approximate 420,000 square foot building in Trenton, South Carolina. The transaction funded in February 2021.\nOff-Balance Sheet A\nrrangements\nWe have an arrangement with a finance company to provide floor plan financing for selected dealers. This arrangement provides liquidity for our dealers by financing dealer purchases of products with credit availability from the finance company. We receive payment from the finance company after shipment of product to the dealer, and our dealers are given a longer period of time to pay the finance company. If our dealers do not pay the finance company, we may be required to repurchase the applicable inventory held by the dealer. We do not indemnify the finance company for any credit losses they may incur.\nTotal dealer purchases financed under this arrangement accounted for approximately 12% and 11% of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amount financed by dealers which remained outstanding was $55.6 million and $49.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n26\nCritical Accounting P\nolicies\nIn preparing the financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the asset, liability, revenue and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect our supplemental information disclosures, including information about contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe, given current facts and circumstances, that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, adhere to U.S. GAAP, and are consistently applied. Inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise. We make routine estimates and judgments in determining net realizable value of accounts receivable, inventories, property and equipment, prepaid expenses, product warranties and other reserves. Management believes our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas: goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment; business combinations and purchase accounting; and income taxes.\nGoodwill and Other\nIndefinite-Lived\nI\nntangible\nA\nssets\nRefer to Note 2, “Summary of Accounting Policies – Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Company’s policy regarding the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company performed the required annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for the fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, and found no impairment.\nWhen preparing a discounted cash flow analysis for purposes of our annual impairment test, we make a number of key estimates and assumptions. We estimate the future cash flows of the business based on historical and forecasted revenues and operating costs. This, in turn, involves further estimates, such as estimates of future growth rates and inflation rates. In addition, we apply a discount rate to the estimated future cash flows for the purpose of the valuation. This discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business and may change from year to year. Weighted average cost of capital includes certain assumptions such as market capital structures, market betas, risk-free rate of return and estimated costs of borrowing.\nIn our October 31, 2020 impairment test calculation, the Latin America reporting unit and the Generac Mobile Products reporting unit each had an estimated fair value that exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%.\nThe carrying value of the Latin America goodwill was $43.6 million. Key financial assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of the reporting unit include revenue growth levels that reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with an eventual return to normalized revenue growth patterns and profitability from recovering end markets, improving profit margins, a 3% terminal growth rate and an 11.7% discount rate. The reporting unit’s fair value would approximate its carrying value with a 70 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 75 basis point reduction in the sales continuous annual growth rate and terminal growth rate.\nThe carrying value of the Generac Mobile Products goodwill was $48.6 million. Key financial assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of the reporting unit include revenue growth levels that reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the impact of a decline in oil prices on end markets with an eventual return to normalized revenue growth levels from recovering end markets, improving profit margins, a 3% terminal growth rate and a 14.6% discount rate. The reporting unit’s fair value would approximate its carrying value with a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 100 basis point reduction in the sales continuous annual growth rate and terminal growth rate.\nAs noted above, a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests. While we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable, different assumptions could change the estimated fair values. A number of factors, many of which we have no ability to control, could cause actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed. These factors include:\nIf management's estimates of future operating results change or if there are changes to other assumptions due to these factors, the estimate of the fair values may change significantly. Such change could result in impairment charges in future periods, which could have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition.\n27\nBusiness\nC\nombinations and\nP\nurchase\nA\nccounting\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their respective fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Assigning fair market values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of an acquisition requires knowledge of current market values, the values of assets in use, and often requires the application of judgment regarding estimates and assumptions. While the ultimate responsibility resides with management, for material acquisitions we retain the services of certified valuation specialists to assist with assigning estimated values to certain acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including intangible assets and tangible long-lived assets. Acquired intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are valued using certain discounted cash flow methodologies based on future cash flows specific to the type of intangible asset purchased. This methodology incorporates various estimates and assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, profit margins, forecasted cash flows, discount rates and terminal growth rates. Refer to Note 1, “Description of Business,” and Note 3, \"Acquisitions,\" to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Company’s business acquisitions.\nIncome T\naxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740,\nIncome Taxes\n. Our estimate of income taxes payable, deferred income taxes and the effective tax rate is based on an analysis of many factors including interpretations of federal, state and international income tax laws; the difference between tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities; estimates of amounts currently due or owed in various jurisdictions; and current accounting standards. We review and update our estimates on a quarterly basis as facts and circumstances change and actual results are known.\nIn assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the taxable income in prior carryback years, scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.\nRefer to Note 15, “Income Taxes,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Company’s income taxes.\nNew Accounting Standards\nFor information with respect to new accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, refer to Note 2, “Summary of Accounting Policies - New Accounting Pronouncements,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe computation of Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Generac Holdings Inc. is based on the definition of EBITDA contained in our credit agreement, as amended. To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we provide the computation of Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Company, taking into account certain charges and gains that were recognized during the periods presented.\nWe view Adjusted EBITDA as a key measure of our performance. We present Adjusted EBITDA not only due to its importance for purposes of our credit agreements, but also because it assists us in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis as it excludes items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA:\n28\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of the Company. Management believes the disclosure of Adjusted EBITDA offers an additional financial metric that, when coupled with results prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of our results of operations and the factors and trends affecting our business. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors for the following reasons:\nThe adjustments included in the reconciliation table listed below are provided for under our Term Loan and ABL Facility, and also are presented to illustrate the operating performance of our business in a manner consistent with the presentation used by our management and Board of Directors. These adjustments eliminate the impact of a number of items that:\nWe explain in more detail in footnotes (a) through (g) below why we believe these adjustments are useful in calculating Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of our operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA does not represent, and should not be a substitute for, net income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations are:\n29\nFurthermore, as noted above, one of our uses of Adjusted EBITDA is as a benchmark for determining elements of compensation for our senior executives. At the same time, some or all of these senior executives have responsibility for monitoring our financial results, generally including the adjustments in calculating Adjusted EBITDA (subject ultimately to review by our Board of Directors in the context of the Board's review of our financial statements). While many of the adjustments (for example, transaction costs and credit facility fees), involve mathematical application of items reflected in our financial statements, others involve a degree of judgment and discretion. While we believe all of these adjustments are appropriate, and while the calculations are subject to review by our Board of Directors in the context of the Board's review of our financial statements, and certification by our Chief Financial Officer in a compliance certificate provided to the lenders under our Term Loan and ABL Facility, this discretion may be viewed as an additional limitation on the use of Adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool.\nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Generac Holdings Inc.:\n(a) Includes the noncontrolling interests’ share of expenses related to Pramac purchase accounting, including intangible amortization of $4.3 million, $4.2 million, and $4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n(b) Represents the following non-cash adjustments: gains/losses on disposal of assets, unrealized mark-to-market adjustments on commodity contracts, transactional foreign currency gains/losses and certain purchase accounting related adjustments. We believe that adjusting net income for these non-cash items is useful for the following reasons:\n(c) Represents share-based compensation expense to account for stock options, restricted stock and other stock awards over their respective vesting period.\n(d) Represents the non-cash write-off of original issue discount and deferred financing costs due to voluntary prepayments of Term Loan debt. Refer to Note 12, “Credit Agreements,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the losses on extinguishment of debt.\n(e) Represents pre-tax settlement charges related to the termination of the Company’s domestic pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2019. Refer to Note 16, “Benefit Plans,” to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding the Company’s pension plans.\n(f) Represents transaction costs incurred directly in connection with any investment, as defined in our credit agreement, equity issuance, or debt issuance or refinancing, together with certain fees relating to our senior secured credit facilities, such as administrative agent fees and credit facility commitment fees under our Term Loan and ABL Facility, which we believe to be akin to, or associated with, interest expense and whose inclusion in Adjusted EBITDA is therefore similar to the inclusion of interest expense in that calculation.\n(g) Typically, represents severance and non-recurring plant consolidation costs. For the year-ended December 31, 2020, represents severance, non-cash asset write-downs and other charges to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and decline in oil prices on demand for C&I products. These charges represent expenses that are nonrecurring and do not reflect our ongoing operations.\n30\nAdjusted Net Income\nTo further supplement our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we provide the computation of Adjusted Net Income attributable to the Company, which is defined as net income before noncontrolling interest and provision for income taxes adjusted for the following items: cash income tax expense, amortization of intangible assets, amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount related to our debt, intangible impairment charges, certain transaction costs and other purchase accounting adjustments, losses on extinguishment of debt, business optimization expenses, certain other non-cash gains and losses, and adjusted net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, as set forth in the reconciliation table below.\nWe believe Adjusted Net Income is used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of our company’s operations. Management believes the disclosure of Adjusted Net Income offers an additional financial metric that, when used in conjunction with U.S. GAAP results and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of our ongoing results of operations, and the factors and trends affecting our business.\nThe adjustments included in the reconciliation table listed below are presented to illustrate the operating performance of our business in a manner consistent with the presentation used by investors and securities analysts. Similar to the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation, these adjustments eliminate the impact of a number of items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance or cash flows, such as amortization costs, transaction costs and write-offs relating to the retirement of debt. We also make adjustments to present cash taxes paid as a result of our favorable tax attributes, causing our cash tax rate to be lower than our U.S GAAP tax rate.\nSimilar to Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income does not represent, and should not be a substitute for, net income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of the limitations are:\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted Net Income attributable to Generac Holdings Inc.:\n(a) Represents transaction costs incurred directly in connection with any investment, as defined in our credit agreement, equity issuance or debt issuance or refinancing, and certain purchase accounting adjustments.\n(b) For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the amount is based on a cash income tax rate of 17.9%, 15.0%, and 15.1%, respectively. Cash income tax expense is based on the projected taxable income and corresponding cash taxes payable for the full year after considering the effects of current and deferred income tax items, and is calculated by applying the derived cash tax rate to the period’s pretax income.\n31"

    "text": "We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. To reduce the risk from these changes, we use financial instruments from time to time. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.\nForeign C\nurrency\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, as well as operating businesses in foreign countries. Periodically, we utilize foreign currency forward purchase and sales contracts to manage the volatility associated with certain foreign currency purchases and sales in the normal course of business. Contracts typically have maturities of twelve months or less. Realized gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign currency are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold in the statements of comprehensive income.\nThe following is a summary of the forty-four foreign currency contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2020 (notional amount in thousands):\nCommodity P\nrices\nWe are a purchaser of commodities and components manufactured from commodities including steel, aluminum, copper and others. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuating market prices for those commodities. While such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers, commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. We generally buy these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the supplier as part of the purchase process. Depending on the supplier, these market prices may reset on a periodic basis based on negotiated lags and calculations. To the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers, or our suppliers are not able to honor such prices, we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies or supply chain savings to offset increases in commodity costs.\nPeriodically, we engage in certain commodity risk management activities to mitigate the impact of potential price fluctuations on our financial results. These derivatives typically have maturities of less than eighteen months. As of December 31, 2020, we had the following commodity forward contract outstanding (notional amount in thousands):\nInterest R\nates\nAs of December 31, 2020, all of the outstanding debt under our Term Loan and ABL Facility was subject to floating interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2020, we had the following interest rate swap contracts outstanding (notional amount in thousands of US dollars):\nIn conjunction with the December 2019 amendment to our Term Loan, we also amended the interest swaps to remove the LIBOR floor, which resulted in minor reductions to our future dated swap rates. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of these interest rate swaps was a liability of $29.9 million. Even after giving effect to these swaps, we are exposed to risks due to changes in interest rates with respect to the portion of our Term Loan and ABL Facility that is not covered by the swaps. A hypothetical change in the LIBOR interest rate of 100 basis points would have changed annual cash interest expense by approximately $3.3 million (or, without the swaps in place, $8.3 million) in 2020.\nFor additional information on the Company’s foreign currency and commodity forward contracts and interest rate swaps, including amounts charged to the statement of comprehensive income during 2020, 2019, and 2018, refer to Note 5, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and Note 6, “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss,” to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n32"

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements, effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update 2016-02,\nLeases\n(Topic 842), using the modified retrospective approach.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGoodwill – Refer to Note 9 to the financial statements\n.\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company’s estimate for each reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective reporting unit. This requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions including estimates of future growth rates, inflation rates and discount rates based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the business. Changes in the assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value, which could result in an impairment charge. The Company performed their annual impairment assessment of its reporting units as of October 31, 2020.  In the October 31, 2020 impairment test calculation, the Latin America and Generac Mobile reporting units each had an estimated fair value that exceeded their carrying value by approximately 10%. Because the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value for each, no impairment was recorded.  The carrying value of goodwill for the Company’s Latin America and Generac Mobile reporting units as of the October 31, 2020 impairment assessment was $43.6 million and $48.6 million, respectively.\n33\nKey financial assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of the Latin America reporting unit include revenue growth levels that reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with an eventual return to normalized revenue growth patterns and profitability from recovering end markets, improving profit margins, a 3% terminal growth rate and a 11.7% discount rate. Key financial assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of the Generac Mobile reporting unit include revenue growth levels that reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the impact of a decline in oil prices on end markets with an eventual return to normalized revenue growth levels from recovering end markets, improving profit margins, a 3% terminal growth rate and a 14.6% discount rate.\nThe principle consideration for our determination that the evaluation of goodwill is a critical audit matter is that there is a high degree of auditor effort, judgment and subjectivity involved in designing and performing procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s key financial assumptions utilized to determine the fair value of the Latin America and Generac Mobile reporting units.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the forecasts of future revenue growth rates, improving profit margins, the terminal growth rate and the selection of the discount rate for the Latin America and Generac Mobile reporting units included the following, among others:\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\nFebruary 23, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016.\n34\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Generac Holdings Inc.\nWaukesha, Wisconsin\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Generac Holdings Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded West Coast Energy Systems LLC, which was acquired in July 2020, Mean Green Products, LLC, which was acquired in September 2020, and Enbala Power Networks Inc., which was acquired in October 2020, and whose financial statements constitute 4.7% and 2.6% of net and total assets, respectively, 0.6% of net sales, and (0.3)% of net income of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at West Coast Energy Systems LLC, Mean Green Products, LLC and Enbala Power Networks Inc.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\nFebruary 23, 2021\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\nGenerac Holdings Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nYears Ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018\n(\nU.S.\nDollars in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data)\nFounded in\n1959,\nGenerac Holdings Inc. (the Company) is a leading global designer and manufacturer of a wide range of energy technology solutions. The Company provides power generation equipment, energy storage systems, grid service solutions, and other power products serving the residential, light commercial and industrial markets. Generac’s power products and solutions are available globally through a broad network of independent dealers, distributors, retailers, e-commerce partners, wholesalers, and equipment rental companies, as well as sold direct to certain end user customers.\nOver the years, the Company has executed a number of acquisitions that support its strategic plan (refer to Item\n1\nin this Annual Report on Form\n10\n-K for discussion of our \"Powering Our Future\" strategic plan). A summary of acquisitions affecting the reporting periods presented include:\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries that are consolidated in conformity with U.S. GAAP. All intercompany amounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCash\nand Cash\nEquivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of\nthree\nmonths or less to be cash equivalents.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company maintains the majority of its domestic cash in a few commercial banks in multiple operating and investment accounts. Balances on deposit are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to specified limits. Balances in excess of FDIC limits are uninsured.\n40\nOne\ncustomer accounted for approximately\n13\n% and\n9\n% of accounts receivable at\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\n2019\n, respectively.\nNo\none\ncustomer accounted for greater than\n6\n%,\n5\n%, and\n6\n%, of net sales during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020\n,\n2019\n, or\n2018\n, respectively.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company's trade and other receivables primarily arise from the sale of our products to independent residential dealers, industrial distributors and dealers, national and regional retailers, electrical/HVAC/solar wholesalers, e-commerce partners, equipment rental companies, equipment distributors, solar installers, utilities, and certain end users with payment terms generally ranging from\n30\nto\n90\ndays. The Company evaluates the credit risk of a customer when extending credit based on a combination of various financial and qualitative factors that\nmay\naffect the customers' ability to pay. These factors include the customer's financial condition, past payment experience, credit bureau information, and regional considerations.\nReceivables are recorded at their face value amount less an allowance for credit losses. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses, which represents an estimate of expected losses over the remaining contractual life of its receivables considering current market conditions and estimates for supportable forecasts when appropriate. The Company measures expected credit losses on its trade receivables on an entity by entity basis. The estimate of expected credit losses considers a historical loss experience rate that is adjusted for delinquency trends, collection experience, and/or economic risk where appropriate based on current market conditions. Additionally, management develops a specific allowance for trade receivables known to have a high risk of expected future credit loss.\nThe Company has historically experienced immaterial write-offs given the nature of the customers that receive credit. In addition, the Company holds a credit insurance plan that covers the risk of loss up to specified amounts on certain trade receivables. As of\nDecember 31, 2020,\nthe Company had gross receivables of $\n386,907\nand an allowance for credit losses of $\n12,001\n.\nThe following is a tabular reconciliation of the Company's allowance for credit losses:\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined generally using the\nfirst\n-in,\nfirst\n-out method.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and are being depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are summarized below (in years). Costs of leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the lease (including renewal option periods) or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. Finance lease right of use assets are included in property and equipment. Refer to Note\n10,\n\"Leases,\" to the consolidated financial statements for the Company's lease disclosure.\nTotal depreciation expense was $\n36,493\n, $\n32,265\n, and $\n25,296\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020,\n2019\nand\n2018\n, respectively.\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over fair value of identifiable net assets acquired from business acquisitions. Goodwill is\nnot\namortized, but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if indicators of impairment are present. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually as of\nOctober 31\nor more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value\nmay\nnot\nbe recoverable. The Company has the option to assess goodwill for impairment by performing either a qualitative assessment or quantitative test. The qualitative assessment determines whether it is more likely than\nnot\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is\nnot\nmore likely than\nnot\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is\nnot\nrequired to be performed. If the Company determines that it is more likely than\nnot\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company is required to perform the quantitative test. In the quantitative test, the calculated fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of its book value, the related goodwill is\nnot\nimpaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nOther indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of certain tradenames. The Company tests the carrying value of these tradenames annually as of\nOctober 31,\nor more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying value\nmay\nnot\nbe recoverable, by comparing the assets’ fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, which assumes the fair value of the tradename is the discounted cash flows of the amount that would be paid had the Company\nnot\nowned the tradename and instead licensed the tradename from another company.\nThe Company performed the required annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for the fiscal years\n2020\n,\n2019\nand\n2018\n, and found\nno\nimpairment.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets (excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived tradenames). Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount\nmay\nnot\nbe recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset.\n41\nDebt Issuance Costs\nDebt discounts and direct costs incurred in connection with the issuance or amendment of long-term debt are deferred and recorded as a reduction of outstanding debt and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the related credit agreements. $\n2,598\n, $\n4,712\n, and $\n4,749\nof deferred financing costs and original issue discount were amortized to interest expense during fiscal years\n2020\n,\n2019\nand\n2018\n, respectively. Excluding the impact of any future long-term debt issuances or prepayments, estimated amortization to interest expense for the next\nfive\nyears is as follows:\n2021\n-\n$2,640;\n2022\n-\n$2,689;\n2023\n-\n$2,579;\n2024\n-\n$\n2,508\n;\n2025\n-\n$\n2,555\n.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is a C Corporation and therefore accounts for income taxes pursuant to the liability method. Accordingly, the current or deferred tax consequences of a transaction are measured by applying the provision of enacted tax laws to determine the amount of taxes payable currently or in future years. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the income tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than\nnot\nthat some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will\nnot\nbe realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company considers taxable income in prior carryback years, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies, as appropriate, in making this assessment.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company’s revenues primarily consist of product sales to its customers. The Company considers the purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements, to be the contracts with the customers. For each contract, the Company considers the commitment to transfer products, each of which is distinct, to be the identified performance obligations. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of product, which is generally the price stated in the contract specific for each item sold, adjusted for the value of expected returns, discounts, rebates, or other promotional incentives or allowances offered to our customers. Expected returns for damaged or defective product are estimated using the expected value method based upon historical product return experience. Discounts and rebates offered to customers are typically defined in the master sales agreements with customers and, therefore, are recorded using the most likely amount method based on the terms of the contract. Promotional incentives are defined programs offered for short, specific periods of time and are estimated using the expected value method based upon historical experience. The Company does\nnot\nexpect the transaction price for revenue recognized will be subject to a significant revenue reversal. As the Company’s product sale contracts and standard payment terms have a duration of less than\none\nyear, it uses the practical expedient applicable to such contracts and does\nnot\nconsider the time value of money. Sales, use, value add and other similar taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. The Company has elected to recognize the cost for freight activities when control of the product has transferred to the customer as an expense within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Product revenues are recognized at the point in time when control of the product is transferred to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery to the customer. To determine when control has transferred, the Company considers if there is a present right to payment and if legal title, physical possession, and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset has transferred to the customer. As substantially all of the Company’s product revenues are recognized at a point in time, the amount of unsatisfied performance obligations at each period end is\nnot\nmaterial. The Company’s contracts have an original expected duration of\none\nyear or less. As a result, the Company has elected to use the practical expedient to\nnot\ndisclose its remaining performance obligations.\nAt the request of certain customers, the Company will warehouse inventory billed to the customer but\nnot\ndelivered. Unless all revenue recognition criteria have been met, the Company does\nnot\nrecognize revenue on these transactions until the customer takes possession of the product.\nWhile the Company’s standard payment terms are less than\none\nyear, the specific payment terms and conditions in its customer contracts vary. In some cases, customers prepay for their goods; in other cases, after appropriate credit evaluation, an open credit line is granted and payment is due in arrears. Contracts with payment in arrears are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as accounts receivable upon revenue recognition, while contracts where customers pay in advance are recognized as customer deposits and recorded in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets until revenue is recognized. The balance of customer deposits (contract liabilities) was $\n25,710\nand $\n9,952\nat\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\nDecember 31, 2019\n, respectively. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020\n, the Company recognized revenue of $\n8,703\nrelated to amounts included in the\nDecember 31, 2019\ncustomer deposit balance. The Company typically recognizes revenue within\none\nyear of the receipt of the customer deposit.\n42\nThe Company offers standard warranty coverage on substantially all products that it sells and accounts for this standard warranty coverage as an assurance warranty. As such,\nno\ntransaction price is allocated to the standard warranty, and the Company records a liability for product warranty obligations at the time of sale to a customer based upon historical warranty experience. Refer to Note\n11,\n“Product Warranty Obligations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company’s standard warranties.\nThe Company also sells extended warranty coverage for certain products, which it accounts for as service warranties. In most cases, the extended warranty is sold as a separate contract. As such, extended warranty sales are considered a separate performance obligation, and the extended warranty transaction is separate and distinct from the product. The extended warranty transaction price is initially recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets and amortized on a straight-line basis to net sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income over the life of the contracts following the standard warranty period. For extended warranty contracts that the Company sells under a\nthird\n-party marketing agreement, it is required to pay fees to the\nthird\n-party service provider and classifies these fees as costs to obtain a contract. The contract costs are deferred and recorded as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The deferred contract costs are amortized to net sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income consistent with how the related deferred revenue is recognized. Refer to Note\n11,\n“Product Warranty Obligations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company’s extended warranties.\nIn addition to extended warranties, the Company offers other services, including remote monitoring, installation, maintenance and grid services in certain circumstances. Total service revenues accounted for less than\ntwo\npercent of revenue during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020\n.\nRefer to Note\n7,\n“Segment Reporting,” to the consolidated financial statements for the Company’s disaggregated revenue disclosure. The information discussed above is applicable to each of the Company’s product classes.\nAdvertising and Co-Op Advertising\nExpenditures for advertising, included in selling and service expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, are expensed as incurred. Expenditures for advertising production costs are expensed when the related advertisement is\nfirst\nrun. Expenditures for Co-Op advertising are expensed when claimed by the customer. Total expenditures for advertising were $\n53,678\n, $\n44,153\n, and $\n34,792\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020,\n2019\nand\n2018\n, respectively.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Total expenditures incurred for research and development were $\n80,251\n, $\n68,394\n, and $\n50,019\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020,\n2019\nand\n2018\n, respectively.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\nBalance sheet amounts for non-U.S. Dollar functional currency businesses are translated into U.S. Dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the end of the fiscal year. Income and expenses incurred in a foreign currency are translated at the average rates of exchange in effect during the year. The related translation adjustments are made directly to accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders’ equity, in the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are recognized as incurred in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nASC\n820\n-\n10,\nFair Value Measurement\n,\ndefines fair value, establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring basis or nonrecurring basis. ASC\n820\n-\n10\nclarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the pronouncement establishes a\nthree\n-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level\n1\n) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level\n2\n) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level\n3\n) unobservable inputs in which there is little or\nno\nmarket data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe Company believes the carrying amount of its financial instruments (cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings and ABL facility borrowings), excluding Term Loan borrowings, approximates the fair value of these instruments based upon their short-term nature. The fair value of Term Loan borrowings, which have an aggregate carrying value of $\n815,260\n, was approximately $\n831,038\n(Level\n2\n) at\nDecember 31, 2020\n, as calculated based on independent valuations whose inputs and significant value drivers are observable.\n43\nFor the fair value of the assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis, refer to the fair value table in Note\n5,\n“Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” to the consolidated financial statements. The fair value of all derivative contracts is classified as Level\n2.\nThe valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of derivative contracts, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. The fair value of derivative contracts considers the Company’s credit risk in accordance with ASC\n820\n-\n10.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company records all derivatives in accordance with ASC\n815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n,\nwhich requires derivative instruments to be reported in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of hedging relationships. The Company is exposed to market risk such as changes in commodity prices, foreign currencies and interest rates. The Company does\nnot\nhold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Refer to Item\n7A\nof this Annual Report on Form\n10\n-K for further information on the Company’s derivatives.\nS\nhare\n-Based Compensation\nShare-based compensation expense, including stock options and restricted stock awards, is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the fair value of awards which are expected to vest. The fair value of all share-based awards is estimated on the date of grant. Refer to Note\n17,\n“Share Plans,” to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Company’s share-based compensation plans and accounting.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nChanges to GAAP are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the form of accounting standard updates (“ASUs”) to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). ASUs\nnot\nlisted below were assessed and determined to be either\nnot\napplicable or are\nnot\nexpected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Adopted\nAccounting Standards\nOn\nJanuary 1, 2020\n,\nthe Company adopted ASU\n2016\n-\n13\n,\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic\n326\n)\n:\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n. This guidance was issued to provide financial statement users with more useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. Specifically, this guidance requires entities to utilize a new “expected loss” model as it relates to trade and other receivables. The Company adopted this standard using the modified retrospective approach as of the date of adoption, meaning\nno\nprior period balances were impacted by the adoption. The adoption of the standard impacts the way the Company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts on its trade and other receivables, and the Company recorded a decrease to retained earnings of $\n1,147\nas a result of adopting ASU\n2016\n-\n13.\nResults for reporting periods beginning after\nJanuary 1, 2020\nare presented under ASC\n326\nwhile prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. Refer to Note\n2\nto the consolidated financial statements, “Summary of Accounting Policies - Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses,” for further information regarding the Company’s allowance for expected credit losses.\n44\nOn\nJanuary 1, 2020,\nthe Company elected to apply the optional expedients discussed in ASU\n2020\n-\n04,\nReference Rate Reform.\nThis guidance was issued to address challenges likely to arise in accounting for contract modifications and hedge accounting because of reference rate reform. The update provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued if certain criteria are met. The adoption of the optional expedients in this standard permits the Company to account for the change to a reference rate on its LIBOR based term loan as a continuation of the existing contract rather than having to account for the change in rate as a modification or extinguishment.  Additionally, the election of the optional expedients permits the Company to continue with its hedge accounting treatment for its interest rate swaps despite expected changes due to reference rate reform.\nFiscal\n2020\nAcquisition of Enbala\nOn\nOctober\n7,\n2020,\nthe Company acquired Enbala for a purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $\n41,982\n. The acquisition purchase price was funded solely through cash on hand.\nThe Company recorded a preliminary purchase price allocation during the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2020\nbased upon its estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. As a result, the Company recorded $\n46,645\nof intangible assets, including $\n27,545\nof goodwill recorded in the Domestic segment, as of the acquisition date. A portion of the goodwill ascribed to this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of Enbala from the date of acquisition through\nDecember 31, 2020.\nOther Acquisitions\nIn\nJuly 2020,\nthe Company acquired Energy Systems, its industrial distributor in northern California.\nIn\nSeptember\n2020,\nthe Company acquired Mean Green, a designer and manufacturer of commercial grade, battery-powered turf care products.\nThe combined purchase price for these acquisitions was $\n22,815\nand was funded solely through cash on hand. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of the acquired businesses since the dates of acquisition through\nDecember 31, 2020.\nFiscal\n2019\nAcquisition of Pika\nOn\nApril 26, 2019,\nthe Company acquired Pika for a purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $\n49,068\n. The acquisition purchase price was funded solely through cash on hand.\nThe Company finalized the Pika purchase price allocation during the\nfirst\nquarter of\n2020\nbased upon its estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. As a result, the Company recorded $\n58,196\nof intangible assets, including $\n19,896\nof goodwill recorded in the Domestic segment, as of the acquisition date. The goodwill ascribed to the acquisition is\nnot\ndeductible for tax purposes. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of Pika from the date of acquisition through\nDecember 31, 2020.\nAcquisition of Neurio\nOn\nMarch 12, 2019,\nthe Company acquired Neurio for a purchase price of $\n59,071\n, net of cash acquired and inclusive of a deferred payment of $\n7,922\nwhich was made during the\nthird\nquarter of\n2019.\nThe acquisition purchase price was funded solely through cash on hand.\nThe Company finalized the Neurio purchase price allocation during the\nfirst\nquarter of\n2020\nbased upon its estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. As a result, the Company recorded $\n58,762\nof intangible assets, including $\n17,862\nof goodwill recorded in the Domestic segment, as of the acquisition date. Substantially all of the goodwill ascribed to this acquisition is deductible for tax purposes. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of Neurio from the date of acquisition through\nDecember 31, 2020.\nOther Acquisitions\nIn\nFebruary 2019,\nthe Company acquired a majority share of Captiva, a manufacturer of customized industrial generators in Kolkata, India. The purchase price was immaterial to the Company and was funded solely through cash on hand. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of the acquired business from the date of acquisition through\nDecember 31, 2020.\n45\nFiscal\n2018\nAcquisition of Selmec\nOn\nJune 1, 2018,\nthe Company acquired Selmec for a purchase price of $\n79,972\n, net of cash acquired and inclusive of earnout payments of $\n14,902\n. Changes in the fair value of the earnout liability during\n2020\nand\n2019\nof $(\n2,241\n) and $(\n977\n), respectively, were recognized as a component of operating income in the Company's consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of the earnout liability during\n2020\nand\n2019\nincluded interest accretion of $\n536\nand $\n2,740\n, respectively, and other fair value remeasurement adjustments of $(\n2,777\n) and $(\n3,717\n), respectively. The acquisition purchase price was funded solely through cash on hand.\nThe Company finalized the Selmec purchase price allocation during the\nsecond\nquarter of\n2019\nbased upon its estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. As a result, the Company recorded $\n79,827\nof intangible assets, including $\n46,196\nof goodwill recorded in the International segment, as of the acquisition date. The goodwill ascribed to the acquisition is\nnot\ndeductible for tax purposes. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of Selmec from the date of acquisition through\nDecember 31, 2020\n.\nSummary Purchase Price Allocations\nThe fair values assigned to certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as of the acquisition dates, for the years ended\nDecember 31\nare as follows:\n46\nPro Forma Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma information of the Company gives effect to all acquisitions as though the transactions had occurred on\nJanuary 1, 2018.\nRefer to Note\n1,\n“Description of Business,” for further information on the acquisitions included in the table.\nThis unaudited pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is\nnot\nnecessarily indicative of the results of operations that actually would have been achieved had the acquisitions been consummated on\nJanuary 1, 2018.\nOn\nMarch 1, 2016,\nthe Company acquired a\n65\n% ownership interest in PR Industrial S.r.l. and its subsidiaries (Pramac). The\n35\n% noncontrolling interest in Pramac had an acquisition date fair value of $\n34,253\n, and was recorded as a redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheet, as the noncontrolling interest holder had within its control the right to require the Company to redeem its interest in Pramac. In\nFebruary 2019,\nthe Company amended its agreement with the noncontrolling interest holder of Pramac, extending the agreement by\nfive\nyears, allowing the Company to exercise its call option rights in partial increments at certain times during the\nfive\nyear period, and providing that the noncontrolling interest holder\nno\nlonger holds the right to put its shares to the Company until\nApril 1, 2021.\nThe put and call option price is based on a multiple of earnings, subject to a floor and the terms of the acquisition agreement, as amended.\n47\nOn\nFebruary 1, 2019,\nthe Company acquired a\n51\n% ownership interest in Captiva Energy Solutions, Ltd (Captiva). The\n49\n% noncontrolling interest in Captiva has an acquisition date fair value of $\n3,165\n, and was recorded as a redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheet, as the noncontrolling interest holder had within its control the right to require the Company to redeem its interest in Captiva. The noncontrolling interest holder has a put option to sell his interest to the Company any time after\nfive\nyears from the date of acquisition, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. The put option price is based on a multiple of earnings, subject to the terms of the acquisition. Further, the Company has a call option that it\nmay\nredeem any time after\nfive\nyears from the date of acquisition, or earlier upon the occurrence of certain circumstances. The call option price is based on a multiple of earnings, subject to the terms of the acquisition.\nFor both transactions, the redeemable noncontrolling interest is recorded at the greater of the initial fair value, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interests’ share of comprehensive income (loss), or the estimated redemption value, with any adjustments to the redemption value impacting retained earnings, but\nnot\nnet income. However, the redemption value adjustments are reflected in the earnings per share calculation, as detailed in Note\n14,\n“Earnings Per Share,” to the consolidated financial statements. The following table presents the changes in the redeemable noncontrolling interest:\nCommodities\nThe Company is exposed to price fluctuations in commodities including steel, copper and aluminum; and periodically utilizes commodity derivatives to mitigate the impact of these potential price fluctuations on its financial results. These derivatives typically have maturities of less than\neighteen\nmonths. At\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\n2019\n, the Company had\none\nand\nno\ncommodity contracts outstanding, respectively.\nBecause these contracts do\nnot\nqualify for hedge accounting, the related gains and losses are recorded in cost of goods sold in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net pre-tax gains (losses) recognized were $\n2,185\n, $(\n174\n), and $(\n874\n) for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020,\n2019\nand\n2018\n, respectively.\nForeign Currencies\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. The Company periodically utilizes foreign currency forward purchase and sales contracts to manage the volatility associated with certain foreign currency purchases and sales in the normal course of business. Contracts typically have maturities of\ntwelve\nmonths or less. As of\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\n2019\n, the Company had\nforty-four\nand\nforty-three\nforeign currency contracts outstanding, respectively.\nBecause these contracts do\nnot\nqualify for hedge accounting, the related gains and losses are recorded in \"other, net\" in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net pre-tax gains (losses) recognized for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020,\n2019\nand\n2018\nwere $\n355\n, $(\n1,195\n), and $(\n653\n), respectively.\n48\nInterest Rate Swaps\nIn\n2017,\nthe Company entered into\ntwenty\ninterest rate swap agreements,\ntwelve\nof which were still outstanding as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\nIn\nDecember 2019,\nin conjunction with the amendment to its Term Loan, the Company amended those interest rate swaps to remove the LIBOR floor, which also resulted in minor reductions to the future dated swap fixed rates. In\nMarch 2020,\nthe Company entered into\nthree\nadditional interest rate swap agreements, bringing the total outstanding interest rate swaps to\nfifteen\nas of\nDecember 31, 2020.\nThe Company formally documented all relationships between interest rate hedging instruments and the related hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategies for undertaking these hedge transactions. These interest rate swap agreements qualify as cash flow hedges and therefore, the effective portions of the gains or losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in the consolidated balance sheets. The amount of after-tax gains (losses) recognized for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020,\n2019\nand\n2018\nwere $(\n14,285\n), $(\n13,855\n), and $\n2,924\n, respectively. The cash flows of the swaps are recognized as adjustments to interest expense each period. The ineffective portions of the derivatives’ changes in fair value, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings.\nFair Value\nThe following table presents the fair value of the Company’s derivatives:\nThe fair value of the commodity contract is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and the fair values of the foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps are included in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of\nDecember 31, 2020\n. The fair value of the commodity and foreign currency contracts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of\nDecember 31, 2019\n. Excluding the impact of credit risk, the fair value of the derivative contracts as of\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\n2019\nis a liability of $\n28,667\nand $\n10,588\n, respectively, which represents the net amount the Company would pay to exit all of the agreements on those dates.\nThe following presents a tabular disclosure of changes in AOCL during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\n2019\n, net of tax:\n49\nThe Company has\ntwo\nreportable segments for financial reporting purposes – Domestic and International. The Domestic segment includes the legacy Generac business (excluding its traditional Latin American export operations), and the acquisitions that are based in the U.S. and Canada, all of which have revenues substantially derived from the U.S. and Canada. The International segment includes the legacy Generac business Latin American export operations, and the Ottomotores, Tower Light, Pramac, Motortech and Selmec acquisitions, all of which have revenues substantially derived from outside the U.S and Canada. Both reportable segments design and manufacture a wide range of energy technology solutions and other power products. The Company has multiple operating segments, which it aggregates into the\ntwo\nreportable segments, based on materially similar economic characteristics, products, production processes, classes of customers, distribution methods and regional considerations.\nThe Company's product offerings consist primarily of power generation equipment, energy storage systems, and other power products geared for varying end customer uses. Residential products and C&I products are each a similar class of products based on similar power output and end customer. The breakout of net sales between residential, C&I, and other products by reportable segment is as follows:\n50\nResidential products consist primarily of automatic home standby generators ranging in output from\n7.5kW\nto\n150kW,\nportable generators, energy storage and monitoring solutions, and other outdoor power equipment. These products are sold through independent residential dealers, national and regional retailers, e-commerce merchants, electrical/HVAC/solar wholesalers, solar installers, and outdoor power equipment dealers. The residential products revenue consists of the sale of the product to our distribution partners, which in turn sell or rent the product to the end consumer, including installation and maintenance services. In some cases, residential products are sold direct to the end consumer. Substantially all of the residential products revenues are transferred to the customer at a point in time.\nC&I products consist of larger output stationary generators used in C&I applications and fueled by diesel, natural gas, liquid propane and bi-fuel, with power outputs ranging from\n10kW\nup to\n3,250kW.\nAlso included in C&I products are mobile generators, light towers, mobile heaters and mobile pumps. These products are sold through industrial distributors and dealers, equipment rental companies and equipment distributors. The C&I products revenue consists of the sale of the product to our distribution partners, which in turn sell or rent the product to the end customer, including installation and maintenance services. In some cases, C&I products are sold direct to the end customer. Substantially all of the C&I products revenues are transferred to the customer at a point in time.\nOther consists primarily of aftermarket service parts and product accessories sold to our dealers, the amortization of extended warranty deferred revenue, remote monitoring subscription revenue, grid services, installation and maintenance service revenue. The aftermarket service parts and product accessories are generally transferred to the customer at a point in time, while the extended warranty and subscription revenue are recognized over the life of the contract. Other service revenue is recognized when the service is performed.\nManagement evaluates the performance of its segments based primarily on Adjusted EBITDA, which is reconciled to Income before provision for income taxes below. The computation of Adjusted EBITDA is based on the definition that is contained in the Company’s credit agreements.\n51\nThe following tables summarize additional financial information by reportable segment:\nThe Company’s sales in the United States represent approximately\n82\n%,\n75\n%, and\n74\n% of total sales for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020,\n2019\nand\n2018\n, respectively. Approximately\n81\n% and\n80\n% of the Company’s identifiable long-lived assets are located in the United States as of\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\n2019,\nrespectively.\nInventories consist of the following:\n52\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\n2019\n, inventories totaling $\n9,154\nand $\n18,684\n, respectively, were on consignment at customer locations.\nProperty and equipment consists of the following:\nTotal property and equipment included finance leases of $\n27,269\nand $\n26,063\nat\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\n2019,\nrespectively, primarily made up of buildings and improvements. Amortization of finance lease right of use assets is recorded within depreciation expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The initial measurement of new finance lease right of use assets is accounted for as a non-cash item in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Refer to Note\n10,\n“Leases,” for further information regarding the Company’s accounting for leases under ASC\n842,\nLeases.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\n2019\nare as follows:\nRefer to Note\n3,\n“Acquisitions,” to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company’s acquisitions.\nThe details of the gross goodwill applicable to each reportable segment at\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\n2019\nare as follows:\n53\nThe following table summarizes intangible assets by major category as of\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\n2019\n:\nAmortization of intangible assets was $\n32,280\n, $\n28,644\nand $\n22,112\nin\n2020\n,\n2019\nand\n2018\n, respectively. Excluding the impact of any future acquisitions, the Company estimates amortization expense for the next\nfive\nyears will be as follows:\n2021\n-\n$\n33,906\n;\n2022\n-\n$\n26,649\n;\n2023\n-\n$\n22,129\n;\n2024\n-\n$\n18,581\n;\n2025\n-\n$\n16,808\n.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. The Company recognizes a right of use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s leases generally do\nnot\nprovide an implicit rate, the incremental borrowing rate is used to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is a collateralized rate determined based on the lease term, the Company’s credit rating, and other market information available at the commencement date. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to the commencement date and is reduced by any lease incentives. The lease term\nmay\ninclude options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while lease expense for finance leases is recognized as depreciation and interest expense using the effective interest method. The Company’s variable lease expense generally consists of property tax and insurance payments that are variable in nature, however, these amounts are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements and are therefore\nnot\nseparately reported.\nThe Company has lease agreements with both lease and nonlease components, which it elected to account for as a single lease component. However, the Company did\nnot\nelect to apply the recognition exception for short-term leases. The Company is applying these elections to all asset classes.\nThe Company leases certain manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, office space, warehouses, automobiles, machinery and computer equipment globally under both finance and operating leases. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of up to\n20\nyears, of which certain leases, primarily within the buildings and improvements asset class, include options to extend the leases for up to\n10\nadditional years. Further, the Company leases certain buildings from a noncontrolling interest holder, which the Company has determined to be arms’ length transactions.\nThe Company is a lessor of\none\nbuilding that it leases to a\nthird\nparty. The lease income related to this arrangement is\nnot\nmaterial to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company records its operating lease cost and amortization of finance lease ROU assets within cost of goods sold or operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income depending on the cost center of the underlying asset. The Company records its finance lease interest cost within interest expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n54\nThe components of total lease cost consist of the following:\nPrior to the adoption of ASU\n2016\n-\n02\nin\n2019,\nlease expense consisted of payments on operating leases. Total rent expense related to operating leases for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2018\nwas approximately $\n10,739\n.\nAs of\nJanuary 1, 2019,\nthe date of the adoption of ASU\n2016\n-\n02,\nthe Company recognized ROU assets and lease liabilities related to operating leases of $\n42,024\nand $\n42,056\n, respectively, and there was\nno\ncumulative effect adjustment made to retained earnings. Supplemental balance sheet information related to the Company’s leases is as follows:\nSupplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s leases is as follows:\n55\nWeighted average remaining lease term and discount rate information related to the Company’s leases as of\nDecember 31, 2020\nis as follows:\nThe maturities of the Company’s lease liabilities as of\nDecember 31, 2020\nare as follows:\nThe Company records a liability for standard product warranty obligations accounted for as assurance warranties at the time of sale to a customer based upon historical warranty experience. The Company also records a liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable. The following is a tabular reconciliation of the Company’s standard product warranty liability accounted for as an assurance warranty:\nThe Company also sells extended warranty coverage for certain products, which it accounts for as a service warranty. The sales of extended warranties are recorded as deferred revenue, and typically have a duration of\nfive\nto\nten\nyears. The deferred revenue related to extended warranty coverage is amortized over the duration of the extended warranty contract period, following the standard warranty period, using the straight-line method. The Company believes the straight-line method is appropriate because the performance obligation is satisfied based on the passage of time. The amortization of deferred revenue is recorded to net sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The following is a tabular reconciliation of the deferred revenue related to extended warranty coverage:\n56\nThe timing of recognition of the Company’s deferred revenue balance related to extended warranties at\nDecember 31, 2020\nis as follows:\nThe Company has a post-sale extended warranty marketing program with a\nthird\nparty. In the program’s agreement, the Company is required to pay fees to the\nthird\n-party service provider based on the number of extended warranty contracts that they sell, which it classifies as costs to obtain a contract. The contract costs are deferred and recorded as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The deferred contract costs are amortized to net sales in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income over the same period that the underlying deferred revenue is recognized. The balance of deferred contract costs as of\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\n2019\nwas $\n6,869\nand $\n6,190\n, respectively. Amortization of deferred contract costs recorded during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020,\n2019\nand\n2018\nwas $\n1,303\n, $\n869\nand $\n615\n, respectively.\nStandard product warranty obligations and extended warranty related deferred revenues are included in the consolidated balance sheets as follows:\nShort-term borrowings are included in the consolidated balance sheets as follows:\nLong-term borrowings are included in the consolidated balance sheets as follows:\n57\nMaturities of long-term borrowings outstanding at\nDecember 31, 2020\n, excluding finance lease obligations as their maturities are disclosed in Note\n10,\n“Leases,” and before considering original issue discount and deferred financing costs, are as follows:\nThe Company’s credit agreements originally provided for a $\n1,200,000\nterm loan B credit facility (Term Loan) and currently include a $\n300,000\nuncommitted incremental term loan facility. The maturity date of the Term Loan is currently\nDecember 13, 2026.\nThe Term Loan is guaranteed by all of the Company’s wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, and is secured by associated collateral agreements which pledge a\nfirst\npriority lien on virtually all of the Company’s assets, including fixed assets and intangibles, other than cash, trade accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets and proceeds thereof, which are secured by a\nsecond\npriority lien. The Term Loan initially bore interest at rates based upon either a base rate plus an applicable margin of\n1.75\n% or adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of\n2.75\n%, subject to a LIBOR floor of\n0.75\n%. Currently, the Term Loan bears interest at rates based upon either a base rate plus an applicable margin of\n0.75\n% or adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of\n1.75\n%.\nIn\nJune 2018,\nthe Company amended the Term Loan, which further reduced the applicable margin rates to base rate plus a fixed applicable margin of\n0.75\n% or adjusted LIBOR rate plus a fixed applicable margin of\n1.75\n%. In connection with this amendment and in accordance with ASC\n470\n-\n50,\nthe Company capitalized $\n829\nof fees paid to creditors as deferred financing costs on long-term borrowings and expensed $\n118\nof transaction fees in the\nsecond\nquarter of\n2018.\nIn\nDecember 2019,\nthe Company amended its Term Loan to extend the maturity date from\nMay 31, 2023\nto\nDecember 13, 2026,\nas well as to remove the LIBOR floor of\n0.75%\nfrom the adjusted LIBOR rate. In connection with this amendment and in accordance with ASC\n470\n-\n50,\nthe Company capitalized $\n1,247\nof fees paid to creditors as deferred financing costs on long-term borrowings and expensed $\n432\nof transaction fees in the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2019.\nAdditionally, the Company made a voluntary prepayment of $\n49,000\non the Term Loan, which resulted in the write-off of $\n926\nof original issue discount and capitalized debt issuance costs as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nIn connection with our Term Loan amendment in\nDecember 2019,\nlanguage was added to the agreement to include a benchmark replacement rate, selected by the administrative agent and the borrower, as a replacement to LIBOR that would take affect at the time LIBOR ceases. The Company plans to work with its lenders in the future to amend other LIBOR based debt agreements to add a replacement rate should the use of LIBOR cease.\nThe Term Loan does\nnot\nrequire an Excess Cash Flow payment if the Company’s net secured leverage ratio is maintained below\n3.75\nto\n1.00\ntimes. As of\nDecember 31, 2020\n, the Company’s net secured leverage ratio was\n1.12\nto\n1.00\ntimes, and the Company was in compliance with all covenants of the Term Loan. There are\nno\nfinancial maintenance covenants on the Term Loan.\nThe Company’s credit agreements also provide for a senior secured ABL revolving credit facility (ABL Facility). The maturity date of the ABL Facility is currently\nJune 12, 2023.\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility are guaranteed by all of the Company’s wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, and are secured by associated collateral agreements which pledge a\nfirst\npriority lien on all cash, trade accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets and proceeds thereof, and a\nsecond\npriority lien on all other assets, including fixed assets and intangibles of the Company and certain domestic subsidiaries. ABL Facility borrowings initially bore interest at rates based upon either a base rate plus an applicable margin of\n1.00\n% or adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of\n2.00\n%, in each case, subject to adjustments based upon average availability under the ABL Facility. Currently, the ABL Facility bears interest at rates based upon either a base rate plus an applicable margin of\n0.125\n% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of\n1.125\n%, in each case subject to adjustments based upon average availability under the ABL Facility.\n58\nIn\nJune 2018,\nthe Company amended the ABL Facility; increasing it from $\n250,000\nto $\n300,000\nand extending the maturity date to\nJune 12, 2023.\nIn addition, the ABL Facility amendment modified the pricing by reducing certain applicable interest rates to either a base rate plus an applicable margin of\n0.375\n% or an adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of\n1.375\n%. In connection with this amendment and in accordance with ASC\n470\n-\n50,\nthe Company capitalized $\n755\nof new debt issuance costs as deferred financing costs on long-term borrowings and wrote-off $\n34\nof capitalized debt issuance costs as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the\nsecond\nquarter of\n2018.\nIn\nJune 2018,\nthe Company borrowed $\n50,000\nunder the ABL Facility, the proceeds of which were used as a voluntary prepayment of the Term Loan. As a result of the prepayment of the Term Loan, the Company wrote-off $\n1,298\nof original issue discount and capitalized debt issuance costs during the\nsecond\nquarter of\n2018\nas a loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. In\nOctober 2018,\nthe Company repaid the $\n50,000\noutstanding ABL Facility balance with cash on hand.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020\n, there was\nno\noutstanding balance under the ABL Facility, leaving $\n299,621\nof availability, net of outstanding letters of credit.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\nDecember 31, 2019\n, short-term borrowings consisted of borrowings by the Company’s foreign subsidiaries on local lines of credit and the ABL Facility, which totaled $\n39,282\nand $\n58,714\n, respectively.\nIn\nSeptember 2018,\nthe Company’s Board of Directors approved a $\n250,000\nstock repurchase program, which expired in\nOctober 2020.\nIn\nSeptember 2020,\nthe Company’s Board of Directors approved another stock repurchase program, which commenced on\nOctober 27, 2020,\nand allows for the repurchase of up to $\n250,000\nof the Company's common stock over a\n24\n-month period. The Company\nmay\nrepurchase its common stock from time to time, in amounts and at prices the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions and other considerations. The repurchases\nmay\nbe executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated agreements or other transactions. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the program will be determined by management at its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company’s common stock and general market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements, and compliance with the terms of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness. The repurchases\nmay\nbe funded with cash on hand, available borrowings or proceeds from potential debt or other capital markets sources. The stock repurchase program\nmay\nbe suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\n2019,\nthe Company did\nnot\nrepurchase any shares of its common stock. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2018,\nthe Company repurchased\n560,000\nshares of its common stock for $\n25,656\n, all funded with cash on hand. Since the inception of all programs starting in\nAugust 2015,\nthe Company has repurchased\n8,676,706\nshares of its common stock for $\n305,547\n(at an average cost per share of $\n35.21\n), all funded with cash on hand.\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to the common shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, exclusive of restricted shares. Except where the result would be anti-dilutive, diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming the vesting of unvested restricted stock and the exercise of stock options. Refer to Note\n4,\n“Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest,” to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the accounting for redeemable noncontrolling interests.\n59\nThe following table reconciles the numerator and the denominator used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share:\nThe Company’s provision for income taxes consists of the following:\nThe Company files U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign jurisdiction tax returns which are subject to examination up to the expiration of the statute of limitations. The Company believes the tax positions taken on its returns would be sustained upon an exam, or where a position is uncertain, adequate reserves have been recorded. As of\nDecember 31, 2020\n, the Company is\nno\nlonger subject to income tax examinations for United States federal income taxes for tax years prior to\n2017.\nDue to the carryforward of net operating losses and research & development credits, the Company’s Wisconsin state income tax returns for tax years\n2009\nthrough\n2019\nremain open. In addition, the Company is subject to audit by various foreign taxing jurisdictions for tax years\n2015\nthrough\n2019.\nThe Company is regularly under tax return examination by tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The Company is actively managing the examinations and working to address any open matters. While the Company does\nnot\nbelieve any material taxes or penalties are due, there is a possibility that the ultimate tax outcome of an examination\nmay\nresult in differences from what was recorded. Such differences\nmay\naffect the provision for income taxes in the period in which the determination is made, and could impact the Company’s financial results.\n60\nSignificant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\n2019\n, deferred tax assets of $\n1,497\nand $\n2,933\n, and deferred tax liabilities of $\n115,769\nand $\n96,328\n, respectively, were reflected on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company maintains a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets when it is uncertain it will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the asset. During\n2020\n, the valuation allowance increased by $\n716\nprimarily due to state net operating losses which are unlikely to be utilized, partially offset by utilization of loss carryforwards in certain foreign subsidiaries.\nAt\nDecember 31, 2020\n, the Company had various state research & development and state manufacturing tax credit carryforwards of approximately $\n4,513\nand $\n19,303\n, respectively, which expire between\n2024\nand\n2035.\nThe Company believes it will generate sufficient taxable income in these jurisdictions to fully utilize the credits prior to their expiration.\nChanges in the Company’s gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, were as follows:\nThe unrecognized tax benefit as of\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\n2019\n, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\n2019\n, total accrued interest of approximately $\n95\nand $\n71\n, respectively, and accrued penalties of approximately $\n274\nand $\n195\n, respectively, associated with net unrecognized tax benefits are included in the consolidated balance sheets. Interest and penalties are recorded as a component of income tax expense.\nThe Company does\nnot\nexpect a significant increase or decrease to the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations during the fiscal year ending\nDecember\n31,\n2021.\n61\nA reconciliation of the statutory tax rates and the effective tax rates for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020,\n2019\nand\n2018\nare as follows:\nMedical and Dental Plans\nThe Company maintains medical and dental benefit plans covering its full-time domestic employees and their dependents. These plans are partially or fully self-funded under which participant claims are obligations of the plan. These plans are funded through employer and employee contributions at a level sufficient to pay for the benefits provided by the plan. The Company’s contributions to the plans were $\n24,617\n, $\n18,290\n, and $\n14,660\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020,\n2019\nand\n2018\n, respectively.\nThe Company’s foreign subsidiaries participate in government sponsored medical benefit plans. In certain cases, the Company purchases supplemental medical coverage for certain employees at these foreign locations. The expenses related to these plans are\nnot\nmaterial to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nSavings Plan\nThe Company maintains a defined-contribution\n401\n(k) savings plan for eligible domestic employees. Under the plan, employees\nmay\ndefer receipt of a portion of their eligible compensation. The Company\nmay\ncontribute a matching contribution of\n50\n% of the\nfirst\n6\n% of eligible compensation of employees that is deferred. The Company\nmay\nalso contribute a non-elective contribution for eligible employees employed on\nDecember 31, 2008\nthat were impacted by the freezing of the Company’s pension plans. The Company’s matching contributions are subject to vesting. Forfeitures\nmay\nbe applied against plan expenses and Company contributions. The Company recognized $\n5,332\n, $\n4,791\nand $\n4,193\nof expense related to these plans for the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2020\n,\n2019\nand\n2018\n, respectively.\nPension Plans\nHistorically, the Company maintained noncontributory salaried and hourly pension plans (Pension Plans) covering certain domestic employees. The Pension Plans were frozen effective\nDecember 31, 2008.\nEffective\nDecember 31, 2018,\nthe Pension Plans were merged into the same plan (Pension Plan), resulting in\nno\nchange to benefits for participants. The benefits under the salaried plan were based upon years of service and the participants’ defined final average monthly compensation. The benefits under the hourly plan were based on a unit amount at the date of termination multiplied by the participant’s years of credited service.\nIn\n2019,\nthe Company completed the termination of its Pension Plan.  In connection with the Company’s activities to terminate the plan, lump sum distributions were made in the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2019\nto individuals who elected lump sum distributions, including rolling over their accounts to the Company’s\n401\n(k) savings plan. Also in the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2019,\nannuity contracts were purchased to settle obligations for the remaining participants. Upon settlement of the pension liability, the Company reclassified related unrecognized pension losses recorded in AOCL to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. As a result, the Company recorded pre-tax settlement charges of $\n10,920\nin the\nfourth\nquarter of the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019.\nCertain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries participate in local statutory defined benefit or other post-employment benefit plans. These plans provide benefits that are generally based on years of credited service and a percentage of the employee’s eligible compensation earned throughout the applicable service period. Liabilities recorded under these plans are included in other long-term liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and are\nnot\nmaterial.\n62\nThe Company adopted an equity incentive plan (the\n2010\nPlan) on\nFebruary 10, 2010\nin connection with its initial public offering. The\n2010\nPlan, as amended, allowed for granting of up to\n9.1\nmillion share-based awards to executives, directors and employees. Awards available for grant under the\n2010\nPlan included stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other share-based awards and performance-based compensation awards. Awards under the\n2010\nPlan ceased in\nJune 2019.\nTotal share-based compensation expense related to the Plan, net of estimated forfeitures, was $\n11,681\n, $\n15,738\n, and $\n14,563\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020,\n2019\nand\n2018\n, respectively, which is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nOn\nJune 13, 2019,\nthe stockholders of Generac Holdings Inc. approved the Company’s\n2019\nEquity Incentive Plan (the\n2019\nPlan). Following the effectiveness of the\n2019\nPlan,\nno\nnew awards\nmay\nbe made under the Plan. The\n2019\nPlan allows for granting of up to\n2.7\nmillion share-based awards to executives, directors and employees. Awards available for grant under the\n2019\nPlan include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, other share-based awards and performance-based compensation awards. Total share-based compensation expense related to the\n2019\nPlan, net of estimated forfeitures, was $\n9,201\nand $\n956\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\n2019,\nrespectively, which is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nStock Options\n- Stock options granted in\n2020\nhave an exercise price between $\n91.00\nper share and $\n158.89\nper share; stock options granted in\n2019\nhave an exercise price of $\n52.07\nper share; and stock options granted in\n2018\nhave an exercise price between $\n43.88\nper share and $\n45.29\nper share. Stock options vest in equal installments over\nfour\nyears, subject to the grantee’s continued employment or service and expire\nten\nyears after the date of grant.\nStock option exercises can be net-share settled such that the Company withholds shares with value equivalent to the exercise price of the stock option awards plus the employees’ minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes. Total shares withheld were\n24,070\n,\n32,211\nand\n63,817\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2020\n,\n2019\nand\n2018\n, respectively, and were based on the value of the stock on the exercise dates. The net-share settlement has the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduce the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued.\nEmployees can also utilize a cashless for cash exercise of stock options, such that all exercised shares will be sold in the market immediately. Cash equivalent to the exercise price of the awards plus the employees’ minimum statutory tax obligations is remitted to the Company, with the remaining cash being transferred to the employee. Total net proceeds from the cashless for cash exercise of stock options were $\n13,089\n, $\n9,395\nand $\n5,614\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2020\n,\n2019\nand\n2018\n, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\nTotal payments made by the Company to the taxing authorities for the employees’ tax obligations related to stock option exercises were $\n7,297\n, $\n3,360\nand $\n3,846\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2020\n,\n2019\nand\n2018\n, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe grant-date fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility is calculated based on an analysis of historic volatility of the Company’s stock price. The average expected life is based on the contractual term of the option using the simplified method. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury\nzero\n-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The compensation expense recognized is net of estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated based on actual share option forfeiture history.\n63\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model for\n2020\n,\n2019\nand\n2018\nare as follows:\nA summary of the Company’s stock option activity and related information for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020,\n2019\nand\n2018\nis as follows:\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020\n, there was $\n10,673\nof total unrecognized compensation cost, net of expected forfeitures, related to unvested options. The cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining service period, having a weighted-average period of\n2.4\nyears. Total share-based compensation cost related to the stock options for the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2020\n,\n2019\nand\n2018\nwas $\n5,860\n, $\n5,597\nand $\n4,998\n, respectively, which is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nRestricted Stock\n– Restricted stock awards vest in equal installments over\nthree\nyears, subject to the grantee’s continued employment or service. Certain restricted stock awards also include performance shares, whereby the number of performance shares that can be earned are contingent upon Company performance measures over a\nthree\n-year period. Performance measures are based on a weighting of a number of financial metrics, from which grantees\nmay\nearn from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of their target performance share award. The performance period for the\n2018\nawards covers the years\n2018\nthrough\n2020,\nthe performance period for the\n2019\nawards covers the years\n2019\nthrough\n2021,\nand the performance period for the\n2020\nawards covers the years\n2020\nthrough\n2022.\nThe Company estimates the number of performance shares that will vest based on projected financial performance. The fair value of restricted awards is determined based on the market value of the Company's shares on the grant date. The fair market value of the restricted awards at the time of the grant is amortized to expense over the period of vesting. The compensation expense recognized for restricted share awards is net of estimated forfeitures.\nRestricted stock vesting is net-share settled such that, upon vesting, the Company withholds shares with value equivalent to the employees’ minimum statutory tax obligation, and then pays the cash to the taxing authorities on behalf of the employees. In effect, the Company repurchases these shares and classifies them as treasury stock. Total shares withheld were\n70,718\n,\n55,953\nand\n38,186\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2020\n,\n2019\nand\n2018\n, respectively, and were based on the value of the stock on the vesting dates. Total payments made by the Company to the taxing authorities for the employees’ tax obligations related to restricted stock vesting were $\n7,613\n, $\n3,078\nand $\n1,812\nfor the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2020\n,\n2019\nand\n2018\n, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n64\nA summary of the Company's restricted stock activity for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020,\n2019\nand\n2018\nis as follows:\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020\n, there was $\n20,608\nof unrecognized compensation cost, net of expected forfeitures, related to non-vested restricted stock awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining service period, having a weighted-average period of\n1.9\nyears. Total share-based compensation cost related to the restricted stock for the years ended\nDecember 31,\n2020\n,\n2019\nand\n2018\n, inclusive of performance shares, was $\n15,022\n, $\n11,097\nand $\n9,565\n, respectively, which is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nDuring\n2020\n,\n2019\nand\n2018\n,\n15,275\n,\n22,544\nand\n33,419\nshares of stock, respectively, were granted to certain members of the Company’s Board of Directors as a component of their compensation for their service on the Board, all of which were fully vested at time of grant. A non-employee director can elect to receive his or her director fees in the form of deferred stock units, which voluntarily defers the issuance of the related shares granted until the director separates from the Company or a triggering event occurs.\n10,528\n,\n16,604\nand\n22,675\nof deferred stock units are included in the shares of stock granted to certain members of the Company’s Board of Directors for the years\n2020\n,\n2019\n, and\n2018\n, respectively. Total share-based compensation cost for these share grants in\n2020\n,\n2019\nand\n2018\nwas $\n1,558\n, $\n1,391\nand $\n1,718\n, respectively, which is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nThe Company has an arrangement with a finance company to provide floor plan financing for certain dealers. The Company receives payment from the finance company after shipment of product to the dealer. The Company participates in the cost of dealer financing up to certain limits and has agreed to repurchase products repossessed by the finance company, but does\nnot\nindemnify the finance company for any credit losses they incur. The amount financed by dealers which remained outstanding under this arrangement at\nDecember 31, 2020\nand\n2019\nwas approximately $\n55,600\nand $\n49,600\n, respectively.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is named as a defendant in various lawsuits in which claims are asserted against the Company. In the opinion of management, the liabilities, if any, which\nmay\nresult from such lawsuits are\nnot\nexpected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.\n65\nFor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020,\n2019\nand\n2018\n:\nThe Company performed an evaluation of subsequent events through the date these financial statements were issued and\nno\nsuch events were identified.\n66"

    "text": "Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in this report on Form 10-K has been recorded, processed, summarized and reported as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-K.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nInternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.\nThere are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error or the circumvention or overriding of the controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving its objective. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate, because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on the criteria established in the 2013\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework\n, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. In conducting this assessment, our management excluded West Coast Energy Systems LLC, which was acquired in July 2020, Mean Green Products, LLC, which was acquired in September 2020, and Enbala Power Networks Inc., which was acquired in October 2020, and whose financial statements constitute 4.7% and 2.6% of net and total assets, respectively, 0.6% of net sales, and (0.3)% of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n67"
