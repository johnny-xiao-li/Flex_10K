    "text": "General\nTexas Pacific Land Corporation (which, together with its subsidiaries as the context requires, may be referred to as “TPL”, the “Company”, “our”, “we” or “us”) is one of the largest landowners in the State of Texas with approximately 880,000 acres of land in West Texas.  Additionally, we own a 1/128th nonparticipating perpetual oil and gas royalty interest (“NPRI”) under approximately 85,000 acres of land, a 1/16th NPRI under approximately 371,000 acres of land, and  approximately 4,000 additional net royalty acres (normalized to 1/8th), all located in the western part of Texas.\nThe Company was originally organized as Texas Pacific Land Trust (the “Trust”) under a Declaration of Trust, dated February 1, 1888, to receive and hold title to extensive tracts of land in the State of Texas, previously the property of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company.   The Declaration of Trust provided for the appointment of trustees (the “Trustees”) to manage the assets of the Trust with all of the powers of an absolute owner.  On January 11, 2021, the Trust completed its reorganization from a business trust, Texas Pacific Land Trust, into Texas Pacific Land Corporation (the “Corporate Reorganization”), a corporation formed and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware.  See further discussion under “Corporate Reorganization” below.  Any references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the Company, TPL, our, we or us with respect to periods prior to January 11, 2021 will be in reference to the Trust, and references to periods on that date and thereafter will be in reference to Texas Pacific Land Corporation or TPL Corporation.\nOur surface and royalty ownership allow steady revenue generation through the entire value chain of oil and gas development.  While we are not an oil and gas producer, we benefit from various revenue sources throughout the life cycle of a well.  During the initial development phase where infrastructure for oil and gas development is constructed, we receive fixed fee payments for use of our land and revenue for sales of materials (caliche) used in the construction of the infrastructure.  During the drilling and completion phase, we generate revenue for providing sourced water and/or treated produced water in addition to fixed fee payments for use of our land.  During the production phase, we receive revenue from our oil and gas royalty interests and also revenues related to saltwater disposal on our land.  In addition, we generate revenue from pipeline, power line and utility easements, commercial leases, material sales and seismic and temporary permits principally related to a variety of land uses, including midstream infrastructure projects and processing facilities as hydrocarbons are processed and transported to market.\nCorporate Reorganization\nOn July 30, 2019, the Trust and the Trustees entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Horizon Kinetics LLC, Horizon Kinetics Asset Management LLC, Murray Stahl, SoftVest, L.P., SoftVest Advisors, LLC, Eric L. Oliver, ART-FGT Family Partners Limited, Tessler Family Limited Partnership and Allan R. Tessler (the “Investor Group”) with respect to the previous proxy contest mounted by the Investor Group and the then-pending litigation between the parties. The parties agreed, among other things, (i) to dismiss the pending litigation captioned Case 3:19-cv-01224-B\nTexas Pacific Land Trust et al v. Oliver in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas in Dallas\n, (ii) to add three new members, including Mr. Stahl and Mr. Oliver, to the Conversion Exploration Committee (the “CE Committee”), which was formed in\nJune 2019 to evaluate the conversion of the Trust into a corporation (the “Conversion”), and (iii) if the CE Committee recommended a plan of Conversion, the Investor Group would be required to support such Conversion.\nOn January 21, 2020, the CE Committee recommended to the Trustees that the Trust approve a plan of corporate reorganization, comprised of the steps, plan and proposed governance terms that had each been reviewed and approved by the CE Committee.\nThe Trustees and the Investor  Group amended the Settlement Agreement on March 6, 2020 and March 20, 2020, in each case for the purpose of, among other things, providing the Trust with additional time to review and approve the plan of corporate reorganization recommended by the CE Committee.\nOn March 23, 2020, the Trustees announced their approval of a plan to reorganize the Trust to a corporation.\nOn June 11, 2020, the Trust entered into a stockholders’ agreement dated as of December 14, 2020, with Horizon Kinetics LLC, Horizon Kinetics Asset Management LLC, SoftVest Advisors, LLC, SoftVest, L.P., and Mission Advisors, LP,(as amended to date, the “Stockholders’ Agreement”), providing for, among other things, the appointment of Dana F. McGinnis, Eric L. Oliver and Murray Stahl as directors of TPL’s board of directors (the “Board”) immediately following the Distribution (as defined below).  On June 15, 2020, the prospective members of the Board were announced, consisting of the current members of our Board.\nOn November 17, 2020, the Trust affirmed its prior approval o\nf the Corporate Reorganization and the distribution of all of TPL Corporation’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”) on the basis of one share of Common Stock for every sub-share in certificates of proprietary interest, par value $0.03-1/3 of the Trust (“Sub-share”) held.\nOn January 11, 2021, TPL completed its Corporate Reorganization.  To implement the Corporate Reorganization, the Trust and TPL Corporation entered into agreements and undertook and caused to be undertaken a series of transactions to effect the transfer to TPL Corporation of all of the Trust’s assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including investments, property and employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to, at and after the Corporate Reorganization. The agreements entered into include a contribution agreement between the Trust and TPL Corporation (the “Contribution Agreement”).\nPrior to the market opening on January 11, 2021, the Trust distributed all of the shares of Common Stock to holders of Sub-shares on a pro rata, one-for-one, basis in accordance with their interests in the Trust (the “Distribution”). As a result of the Distribution, TPL Corporation is now an independent public company and its Common Stock is listed under the symbol “TPL” on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”).\nA summary of the material terms of the Contribution Agreement can be found in our information statement, dated December 31, 2020, which was included as Exhibit 99.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 31, 2020 (the “Information Statement”), under the heading entitled “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Material Agreements of TPL Corporation — Contribution Agreement.” Such summary is incorporated herein by reference.\nBusiness Segments\nWe operate our business in two segments: Land and Resource Management and Water Services and Operations. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives of the Company and provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 10, “Business Segment Reporting” in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLand and Resource Management\nOur Land and Resource Management segment encompasses the business of managing the approximately 880,000 acres of land and our oil and gas royalty interests in West Texas owned by Texas Pacific Resources LLC, a single member Texas limited liability company, owned by the Company.  The revenue streams of this segment consist primarily of royalties from oil and gas, revenues from easements and commercial leases, and land and material sales.\n2\nWe are not an oil and gas producer. Rather, our oil and gas revenue is derived from our oil and gas royalty interests. Thus, in addition to being subject to fluctuations in response to the market prices for oil and gas, our oil and gas royalty revenues are also subject to decisions made by the owners and operators of the oil and gas wells to which our royalty interests relate as to investments in and production from those wells.\nOur revenue from easements is generated from easement contracts covering activities such as oil and gas pipelines and subsurface wellbore easements.  The majority of our easements have a thirty-plus year term but subsequently renew every ten years with an additional payment.  We also enter into agreements with operators and mid-stream companies to lease land from us, primarily for facilities and roads.\nThe demand for, and sale price of, particular tracts of land is influenced by many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the rate of development in nearby areas and the suitability of the particular tract for commercial uses prevalent in West Texas.\nOperations\nRevenues from the Land and Resource Management segment for the last three years were as follows (amounts presented in thousands):\n(1)\nRevenues for 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Please see further discussion of the impact on our financial results for 2020 at Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — COVID-19 Pandemic and Market Conditions.”\nLand Activity for the Year Ended December 31, 2020\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 22,160 acres of land for an aggregate sales price of approximately $16.0 million, an average price of approximately $721 per acre. The sale excluded any mineral or royalty interest in the lands conveyed.  Additionally, the Company recognized land sales revenue of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to land exchanges where the Company had no cost basis in the land conveyed.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company acquired 756 acres of land in Texas for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.9 million, an average of approximately $5,134 per acre (excludes land acquired through the land exchange as previously discussed).\nCompetition\nOur Land and Resource Management segment does not have peers, as such, in that it sells, leases and generally manages land owned by the Company and, to that extent, any owner of property located in areas comparable to the Company is a potential competitor.\n3\nWater Services and Operations\nOur Water Services and Operations segment encompasses the business of providing full-service water offerings to operators in the Permian Basin through Texas Pacific Water Resources LLC (“TPWR”), a single member Texas limited liability company owned by the Company.  Our significant surface ownership in West Texas provides TPWR with a unique opportunity to provide multiple full-service water offerings to operators.\nThese full-service water offerings include, but are not limited to, water sourcing, produced-water gathering/treatment, infrastructure development, disposal solutions, water tracking, analytics and well testing services. We are committed to sustainable water development with significant focus on the large-scale implementation of recycled water operations.  Our significant surface ownership in West Texas provides TPWR with a unique opportunity to provide multiple full-service water offerings to operators.\nCurrently, the revenue streams of this segment principally consist of revenue generated from sales of sourced and treated water as well as revenue from produced water royalties.  Prior to the formation of TPWR, we entered into agreements with energy companies and oilfield service businesses to allow such companies to explore for water, drill water wells, construct water-related infrastructure and purchase water sourced from land that we own. Energy businesses use water for their oil and gas projects while service businesses (i.e., water management service companies) operate water facilities to produce and sell water to energy businesses. While we continue to collect water royalties under these legacy agreements, the overall contribution to revenue from these legacy agreements has declined in recent years and is expected to continue to decline in the future as the activities are undertaken by TPWR.\nOperations\nRevenues from our Water Services and Operations segment for the last three years were as follows (amounts presented in thousands):\n(1)\nRevenues for 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Please see further discussion of the impact on our financial results for 2020 at Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — COVID-19 Pandemic and Market Conditions.”\nThe decrease in water sales during 2020 compared to 2019 is principally due to an 18.7% decrease in the average sales price per barrel of water, a 6.8% decrease in the number of barrels sold and a $7.0 million deferral of water sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to take or pay contracts.  Water royalties under legacy agreements decreased $6.4 million during 2020 compared to 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company invested approximately $4.9 million in TPWR projects to develop and enhance water sourcing and water treatment assets.\nCompetition\nWhile there is competition in the water service business in the Permian Basin, we believe our position as a significant landowner of approximately 880,000 acres in West Texas gives us a unique advantage over our competitors who must negotiate with existing landowners to source water and then for the right of way to deliver the water to the end user.\n4\nMajor Customers\nDuring 2020, we received $54.1 million, or approximately 18% of our total revenues, which included $30.2 million of oil and gas royalties, $21.6 million of easements and other surface-related income and $2.3 million of water sales and royalties, from Occidental Petroleum Corporation and $31.6 million, or approximately 10% of our total revenues, which included $24.5 million of oil and gas royalties, $6.7 million of water sales and royalties and $0.4 million of easements and other surface-related income, from Chevron Corporation.\nSeasonality\nThe business of TPL is not seasonal in nature, as that term is generally understood, although due to the nature of our operations, our revenue may vary widely from year to year and quarter to quarter.\nRegulations\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws. Management believes that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations and that the existence and enforcement of such laws and regulations have no more restrictive effect on our method of operations than on other companies similar to TPL.\nWe cannot determine the extent to which new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations may affect our future operations.\nEnvironmental Considerations\nCompliance with Federal, State and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have had no material effect upon our business generally, including the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company.  To date, the Company has not been called upon to expend any funds for these purposes.\nEmployees and Human Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had 102 full-time employees.  Our business strategy and ability to serve customers relies on employing talented professionals and attracting, training, developing and retaining a knowledgeable skilled workforce. We maintain a good working relationship with our employees. We value our employees and their experience in providing value through land, mineral and water resource management and water solutions. Maintaining a robust pipeline of talent is crucial to our ongoing success and is a key aspect of succession planning efforts across the organization. Our leadership and human resources teams are responsible for attracting and retaining top talent by facilitating an environment where employees feel supported and encouraged in their professional and personal development. Accordingly, we offer industry competitive wages and benefits and are committed to maintaining a workplace environment that promotes employee productivity and satisfaction.\nEmployee safety is also among our top priorities. Accordingly, we have developed and administer company-wide policies to ensure a safe and fair workplace free of discrimination or harassment for each team member and compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) standards, as further discussed in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. This commitment applies to recruiting, hiring, compensation, benefits, training, termination, promotions or any other terms and conditions of employment. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have maintained our strong focus on safety and have taken measures to protect our employees and maintain safe, reliable operations, without implementing furloughs or employee workforce reductions.\nOur existing information technology infrastructure gave us the ability to respond rapidly to the recommended measures of temporarily closing our corporate office and allowing our corporate employees to work remotely. We employed additional safety measures and personal protective equipment for our field employees, including quarantine facilities, if needed, and implementation of a medical hotline for access by all employees should they experience symptoms or seek additional medical information. We strive for a goal of zero occupational injuries, illnesses and incidents in our workplace. To ensure that we protect our safety culture, we have in place a dedicated HS&E team with substantial combined years of experience and have in-house authorized trainers for OSHA-required certified training, powered equipment training and PCE-safe land certificated training.\n5\nAvailable Information\nThe Company makes available, free of charge, on or through its website copies of its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).

    "text": "An investment in our securities involves a degree of risk. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on us. If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or business could be harmed. In that case, the market price of our securities could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur oil and gas royalty revenue is dependent upon the market prices of oil and gas which fluctuate.\nThe oil and gas royalties that we receive are dependent upon the market prices for oil and gas. When lower market prices for oil and gas occur, they will have an adverse effect on our oil and gas royalty revenues. In 2020, our oil and gas royalties were impacted by lower oil and gas prices and may continue to be affected in future periods. The market prices for oil and gas are subject to national and international economic and political conditions and, in the past, have been subject to significant price fluctuations. Price fluctuations for oil and gas have been particularly volatile in recent years and prices have recently experienced a severe decrease due to increased supply by member nations of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus (“OPEC+”) and general economic downturn. At the same time, COVID-19 has spread to many nations of the world and has resulted in the implementation of numerous actions taken by governments and governmental agencies in an attempt to mitigate the spread of the virus. These measures have resulted in a significant reduction in global economic activity and extreme volatility in the global financial markets. The reduction of economic activity has significantly reduced the global demand for oil and gas. The scale and duration of the impact of these factors remain unknowable but could lead to an increase in our operating costs or a decrease in our revenues and have a material impact on our business segments and earnings, cash flow and financial condition.\nWe are not an oil and gas producer.  Our revenues from oil and gas royalties are subject to the actions of others.\nWe are not an oil and gas producer.  Our oil and gas income is derived primarily from perpetual non-participating oil and gas royalty interests that we have retained. As oil and gas wells age, the costs of production may increase and their capacity may decline absent additional investment. However, the owners and operators of the oil and gas wells make all decisions as to investments in, and production from, those wells and our royalties are dependent upon decisions made by those operators, among other factors.  Accordingly, a significant portion of our revenues is reliant on the management of third parties, over whom we have no control.  There can be no assurance that such third parties will take actions or make decisions that will be beneficial to us, which could result in adverse effects on our financial results and performance.\nOur revenues from the sale of land are subject to substantial fluctuation.  Land sales are subject to many factors that are beyond our control.\nLand sales vary widely from year to year and quarter to quarter. The total dollar amount, the average price per acre, and the number of acres sold in any one year or quarter should not be assumed to be indicative of future land sales. The demand for, and the sale price of, any particular tract of our land is influenced by many factors, including the national and local economies, rate of oil and gas well development by operators, the rate of residential and commercial development in nearby areas, livestock carrying capacity and the condition of the local agricultural industry, which itself is influenced by range conditions and prices for livestock and agricultural products. Our ability to sell land is, therefore, largely dependent on the actions of adjoining landowners.\n6\nDemand for TPWR’s products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers. The recent oil and gas industry downturn has (and current market conditions have) resulted in reduced demand for oilfield services and lower expenditures by our customers, which has adversely impacted our earnings, cash flow and financial condition and may continue to do so in the future.\nDemand for TPWR’s products and services depends substantially on expenditures by our customers for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on our customers’ views of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to our customers’ views of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas.\nDeclines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, lower capital expenditures, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us, which would adversely affect our earnings, cash flow and financial condition.\nIn 2020, the results of operations for the Water Services and Operations segment have been impacted by reduced demand and declines in expenditures by our customers due primarily to the economic downturn in 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic  and may continue to be impacted in future periods.\nWe face the risks of doing business in a new and rapidly evolving market for TPWR and may not be able to\nsuccessfully\naddress such risks and achieve acceptable levels of success or profits.\nWe have encountered and may continue to encounter the challenges, uncertainties and difficulties frequently experienced in new and rapidly evolving markets with respect to the business of TPWR, including:\n•\nlimited operating experience;\n•\nstart-up costs for a new line of business;\n•\nlack of sufficient customers or loss of significant customers for the new line of business; and\n•\ndifficulties in managing potentially rapid growth.\nThe impact of government regulation on TPWR could adversely affect our business.\nThe business of TPWR is subject to applicable state and federal laws and regulations, including laws and regulations on water use, environmental and safety matters. These laws and regulations may increase the costs and timing of planning, designing, drilling, installing, operating and abandoning water wells, source water and treatment facilities. TPWR’s business could be affected by problems, slowdowns or other stoppages to operations of providing water treatment critical to the success of TPWR.\nOur business and financial results could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond our control\n.\nOur revenues depend on natural and environmental conditions with respect to operations that result in royalties to us, or that use our water services. Our business and financial results are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond our control, including physical risks from severe storms, floods and other forms of severe weather, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, pipeline disruptions, terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on oil and natural gas production and/or our results of operations.\nOur business and financial results are subject to major trends in our industry, such as decarbonization, and may be adversely affected by future developments out of our control.\nMuch of the value of the land we own and upon which we receive royalties is based on the oil and natural gas located there. Our revenues may be negatively affected by changes driven by trends such as decarbonization efforts.  Such changes may relate to the types or sources of energy in demand, such as a shift to renewable sources of power generation (such as wind and solar), along with ongoing changes in government, investor, customer and consumer policies and preferences.  The evolution of global energy sources is affected by factors out of our control, such as the pace of technological developments and related cost considerations, the levels of economic growth in different markets around the world and the adoption of climate change-related policies.\n7\nThe loss of key members of our management team or difficulty attracting and retaining experienced technical personnel could reduce our competitiveness and prospects for future success.\nThe successful implementation of our strategies and handling of other issues integral to our future success will depend, in part, on our experienced management team, including with respect to the business of TPWR. The loss of key members of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. If we cannot retain our experienced personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.\nOur results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for a full year.\nRevenues from oil and gas royalties may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon market prices for oil and gas and production decisions made by the operators. Our other revenue streams, which include, but are not limited to, water sales and royalties, easements and other surface-related income and sales of land, may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter. As a result, the results of our operations for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for a full year.\nGlobal health threats, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our business.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent and continuing outbreak of COVID-19. A significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population and resulting widespread health crisis could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn, reduced demand for oil and gas and interruption to supply chains related to oil and gas. The reduction of economic activity and reduced global demand for oil and gas related to COVID-19 and actions taken by governments to mitigate the spread of the virus could lead to an increase in our operating costs and have a material impact on our business segments and earnings, cash flow and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Corporate Reorganization\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution, and the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution may adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from our recent Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution is expected to provide the following benefits, among others:\nThe completion of the Corporate Reorganization will implicate transfer restrictions, and may implicate conditions and covenants contained in certain agreements to which the Trust was a party and thereby may cause us to lose certain benefits that the Trust historically received. If the Company is unable to obtain consents to, or approval or waiver of, any such transfer restrictions, conditions or covenants, or is unable to obtain an acknowledgement that any such benefits shall continue for the benefit of TPL Corporation, we may not be entitled to all benefits and other rights under such agreements, which may have an adverse impact on the business and results of operations.\n8\nThe completion of the Corporate Reorganization will implicate transfer restrictions, and may implicate conditions and covenants, contained in certain agreements to which the Trust is a party and thereby may cause us to lose certain benefits that the Trust historically received. Certain counterparties may withhold consent to, or approval or waiver of, transfer restrictions, or certain conditions or covenants in order to or obtain more favorable terms from us.  If the Company is unable to obtain consents to, or approval or waiver of, any such transfer restrictions, conditions or covenants, or if the Company is unable to obtain acknowledgement from any counterparties that any such benefits shall continue for the benefit of TPL Corporation, then we may decide to enforce our rights and interests by initiating legal action. In the meantime, and pending the outcome of any such legal proceeding to enforce our rights, we may be unable to continue to obtain all benefits and other rights under such agreements that would otherwise be transferred to us as part of the Corporate Reorganization. This may have an adverse impact on TPL’s business and results of operations.\nThus far, no such consents, approvals or waivers that have been sought have been denied, but there can be no assurance that such event will not arise as we continue to complete the post-closing requirements of the Corporate Reorganization.\nFor example, the obligation to pay ad valorem taxes with respect to certain of our royalty interests was assumed by a third party and is now the obligation of the successors in interest to such third party (the “obligors”), so long as such royalty interests are held by the Trustees or their successors in office under the Declaration of Trust. Based on a review of public records, we estimate that the payments made for these ad valorem taxes on behalf of the Trust for the year 2020 could be in the range of $4.3 to $7.2 million. The amount of such taxes depends on the valuations determined by various county taxing authorities with respect to our royalty interests and the tax rates used in assessing such ad valorem taxes. Consequently, the amount of ad valorem taxes that may be assessed against our royalty interests may vary from year to year, and we are unable to reliably predict the amount of any such increases or decreases in future years. If, as a result of the Corporate Reorganization, the obligors cease paying these taxes on our behalf, then, pending the outcome of any legal proceeding to enforce our rights, TPL may have to begin paying such ad valorem taxes annually, which would have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution may have adverse tax consequences.\nWe have obtained an opinion from counsel that the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution qualified as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code. The opinion of counsel does not address any U.S. state or local or non-U.S. tax consequences of the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution. The opinion assumed that the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution was completed according to the terms of certain of the operative agreements and required regulatory filings, and relied on the facts as stated therein and in other ancillary agreements and documents. In addition, the opinion was based on certain representations as to factual matters from, and certain covenants by, us and the Trust. The opinion cannot be relied on if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants were incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or were violated in any material respect.\nThe opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and no assurance can be given that contrary positions will not be taken by the IRS or a court. We have not sought and will not seek a ruling from the IRS regarding the federal income tax consequences of the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution.\nIf the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution were to fail to qualify as a reorganization or for tax-free treatment either under Section 368(a)(1)(F) or any other provision of the Code, then U.S. Holders of Sub-shares would recognize gain or loss, as applicable, equal to the difference between (a) the sum of the fair market value of the shares of TPL Corporation Common Stock received by such holder and (b) its adjusted tax basis in the Sub-shares surrendered in exchange therefor. Further, the Trust would recognize taxable gain as if it sold all of its assets, subject to its liabilities, at fair market value. The consequences of the Corporate Reorganization and the Distribution to any holder will depend on that holder’s particular situation.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe cannot be certain that an active trading market for our Common Stock will be sustained after the Corporate Reorganization and, following the Corporate Reorganization, our stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nA public market for our Common Stock did not exist until the Corporate Reorganization was effected on January 11, 2021.  We cannot guarantee that the active trading market that has developed will be sustained for our Common Stock after the Distribution, nor can we predict the prices at which shares of our Common Stock may trade.\nUntil the market has fully evaluated our business as a corporation, the prices at which shares of our Common Stock trade may fluctuate more significantly than might otherwise be typical, even with other market conditions, including general\n9\nvolatility, held constant. The increased volatility of our stock price following the Corporate Reorganization may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The market price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\nThere may be substantial changes in our stockholder base.\nInvestors in the Trust may have held Sub-shares because of a decision to invest in an organization with the Trust’s governance profile or operating track record. Now that the Corporate Reorganization has occurred, the shares of our Common Stock held by those investors will represent an investment in a company with a different governance profile, in particular a board of directors at TPL Corporation subject to changes from year to year at annual elections of directors serving staggered three-year terms. More frequent changes in the leadership of the organization, particularly on the Board, could lead to changes in the operating policies of TPL Corporation over time. Such changes may not match some stockholders’ investment strategies, which could cause them to sell our Common Stock. These changes may also attract new investors who previously did not invest in the Trust because of its governance profile or operating track record. As a result of such changes, our stock price may decline or experience volatility as our stockholder base changes. Additionally, new investors or leadership at TPL Corporation could advocate for business or corporate initiatives that would not be beneficial for all stockholders, such as an untimely sale of the business.\nIf stockholders were to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allowing the issuance of additional equity, holders of our Common Stock could experience dilution in the future.\nIn the future, if stockholders were to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allowing the issuance of additional equity, holders of our Common Stock could be diluted because of equity issuances for proposed acquisitions or capital market transactions or equity awards proposed to be granted to our directors, officers and employees subject to any required vote of holders of our Common Stock under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws. We may issue stock-based awards, including annual awards, new hire awards and periodic retention awards, as applicable, to our directors, officers and other employees under any employee benefits plans we may adopt.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will authorize us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more series of preferred stock having such designations, powers, preferences, privileges and relative, participating, optional and special rights, and qualifications, limitations and restrictions as the Board may generally determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our Common\n10\nStock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of the members of the Board in all events or upon the happening of specified events, or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences that we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our Common Stock.\nWe may not continue the Trust’s historical practice of declaring cash dividends. We will evaluate whether to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock in the future and we cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of dividends, if any.\nThe timing, declaration, amount of, and payment of any cash dividends to our stockholders is within the discretion of our Board and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with any debt service obligations or other contractual obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. Moreover, should our Board determine to pay any dividend in the future, there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay such dividends or the amount of such dividends.\nWe may not continue the Trust’s historical practice of repurchasing outstanding equity of Sub-share holders. We will evaluate whether to repurchase our outstanding Common Stock in the future and we cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of share repurchases, if any.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Trust approved the purchase and subsequent cancellation of 6,258, 59,185 and 105,715 outstanding Sub-shares, respectively.   The Trust did not purchase any outstanding Sub-shares during the year ended December 31, 2020.  We expect that we will from time to time offer to repurchase a portion of our outstanding Common Stock. However, any repurchase will be within the discretion of our Board and will depend upon many factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our Common Stock, available cash and cash flow, capital requirements and the nature of other investment opportunities.\nState law and anti-takeover provisions could enable our Board to resist a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of our stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions are expected to include, among others: (a) the ability of our remaining directors to fill vacancies on our Board (except in an instance where a director is removed by stockholders and the resulting vacancy is filled by stockholders); (b) the inability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; (c) rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings; and (d) the right of our Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”), which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that you may favor. Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with persons that acquire, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation may not engage in a business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or any of its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock.\nWe believe these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board and by providing our Board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make the Company immune from takeovers; however, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board determines is not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas as the sole and exclusive forums for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the Company and our directors and officers.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the Company otherwise determines, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, the U.S. District Court for the District\n11\nof Delaware) or the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, any district court in Dallas County in the State of Texas) will be the sole and exclusive forums for any derivative action brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, employees or stockholders, any action or proceeding asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers, employees or agents arising pursuant to, or seeking to enforce any right, obligation or remedy under any provision of the DGCL, the laws of the State of Texas, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers, employees or agents governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case, subject to the applicable court having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that unless our Board otherwise determines, the federal district courts of the United States will be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, this exclusive forum provision will apply to state and federal law claims, including claims under the federal securities laws, including the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with one or more actions or proceedings described above, a court could rule that one or more parts of the exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation is inapplicable or unenforceable.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with the Company or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition."

    "text": "Market Information\nPrior to our Corporate Reorganization effective January 11, 2021, the Trust’s Sub-shares were traded on the NYSE under the symbol “TPL”. As discussed in Item 1. “Business — General — Corporate Reorganization”, on January 11, 2021, the Trust’s Sub-shares were converted one for one into shares of TPL Corporation’s Common Stock.  Effective January 11, 2021, our  Common Stock began trading on the NYSE under our existing ticker symbol “TPL”.\nThe range of reported sale prices for Sub-shares on the NYSE for each quarterly period during the past two fiscal years was as follows:\nThe Company has paid a cash dividend each year for the preceding 64 years. During 2020, the Company paid a cash dividend of $10.00 per Sub-share in March 2020 and special dividends of $16.00 per Sub-Share, consisting of $6.00 per Sub-share in March 2020 and $10.00 per Sub-share in December 2020.  During March 2019, the Company paid a cash dividend of $1.75 per Sub-share and a special dividend of $4.25 per Sub-share.\nThe Company is not a party to any agreement that would limit its ability to pay dividends in the future, although any future dividends are subject to the discretion of the Board and will depend upon the Company’s earnings, capital requirements and financial position, applicable requirements of law, general economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by our Board.\nThe Board has determined to pay dividends quarterly going forward in  March, June, September and December of each year, subject to the discretion of the Board.  On February 17, 2021, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.75 per share payable on March 15, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 8, 2021.\nThe Company had 219 holders of its Common Stock as of January 31, 2021.\nThe Company has not incorporated equity-related compensation elements in its compensation programs.  During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not issue or sell any equity securities.\nIssuer Purchases of Common Stock\nThe Trust did not repurchase any Sub-shares during the fourth quarter of 2020.\n15\nItem 6.\nSelected Financial Data.\nThe following data should be read in conjunction with Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto incorporated by reference in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    "text": "The following discussion and analysis should be read together with the factors discussed in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and with the\nConsolidated\nFinancial Statements, including the Notes thereto, and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Report. Period-to-period comparisons of financial data are not necessarily indicative, and therefore should not be relied upon as indicators, of the Company’s future performance. Words or phrases such as “does not believe” and “believes,” or similar expressions, when used in this Form 10-K or other filings with the SEC, are intended to identify “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nOverview\nTPL was originally organized in 1888 as a business trust to hold title to extensive tracts of land in numerous counties in West Texas which were previously the property of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company.  As discussed in Item 1. “Business — General — Corporate Reorganization,” on January 11, 2021, we completed our Corporate Reorganization from a business trust to a corporation changing our name from Texas Pacific Land Trust to Texas Pacific Land Corporation.\nOur revenues are derived primarily from oil and gas royalties, sales of water and land, easements and commercial leases.  Due to the nature of our operations, our revenue is subject to substantial fluctuations from quarter to quarter and year to year. The demand for, and sale price of, particular tracts of land is influenced by many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, the rate of development in nearby areas and the suitability of the particular tract for commercial uses prevalent in western Texas.\nWe are not an oil and gas producer. Rather, our oil and gas revenue is derived from our oil and gas royalty interests.  Thus, in addition to fluctuating in response to the market prices for oil and gas, our oil and gas royalty revenues are also subject to decisions made by the owners and operators of the oil and gas wells to which our royalty interests relate as to investments in and production from those wells. We monitor reports from the operators, the Texas Railroad Commission, and other private data providers to assure that we are being paid the appropriate royalties.\nOur revenue from easements is primarily generated from pipelines transporting oil, gas and related hydrocarbons, power line and utility easements and subsurface wellbore easements.  The majority of our easements have a thirty-plus year term but subsequently renew every ten years with an additional payment.  Commercial lease revenue is derived primarily from saltwater disposal royalties, processing, storage and compression facilities and roads.\nTPWR provides full-service water offerings to operators in the Permian Basin. These services include, but are not limited to, water sourcing, produced-water gathering/treatment, infrastructure development, disposal solutions, water tracking, analytics and well testing services. TPWR's revenue streams principally consist of revenue generated from sales of sourced and treated water as well as revenues from produced water royalties.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic and Market Conditions\nThe increased supply of oil and gas by member nations of OPEC+ and the uncertainty caused by the global spread of COVID 19 led to declines in crude oil prices and a reduction in global demand for oil and gas in 2020.  The full impact of these events, which resulted in production curtailments and/or conservation of capital by the owners and operators of the oil and gas wells to which the Company’s royalty interests relate, is unknown at this time.  These events have negatively affected the Company’s business and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring these uncertain times, we have continued to generate positive operating results and remain focused on meeting the operational needs of our customers while maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for our employees.  Our existing information technology infrastructure has afforded us the opportunity to allow our corporate employees to work remotely.  We have deployed additional safety and sanitization measures, including quarantine facilities for our field employees, if needed.\nIn an effort to decrease ongoing operational costs, we have implemented certain cost reduction measures which include, but are not limited to, a reduction in contract labor, conversion of portions of our water sourcing infrastructure to electric power and negotiated price reductions and discounts with certain vendors.  We continue to monitor our customer base and outstanding accounts receivable balances as a means of minimizing any potential collection issues.  As a royalty owner, we have no capital expenditure or operating expense burden for development of wells.  Furthermore, our water operations currently have limited capital expenditure requirements, the amount and timing of which are entirely within our control.\n17\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was enacted on March 27, 2020. The Company evaluated the provisions and potential impacts of this legislation; however, there have been no significant impacts to the Company's results of operations or financial position resulting from the CARES Act for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDespite the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting record low oil prices and reduced demand, we believe our longevity in the industry and strong financial position provide us with the tools necessary to navigate these unprecedented times. We have no debt, a strong cash position (cash and cash equivalents were $281.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020) and we continue to maintain our capital resource allocation discipline.\nLiquidity\nand Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are revenues from oil and gas royalties, easements and other surface-related income, and water and land sales. Our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for capital expenditures related to our Water Services and Operations segment, working capital and general corporate needs.\nWe continuously review our liquidity and capital resources.   If market conditions were to change, for instance due to the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic and/or the recent significant decline in oil prices, and our revenue was reduced significantly or operating costs were to increase significantly, our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced. Should this occur, we could seek alternative sources of funding, including potential future borrowing under a credit facility or other financing options.  We have no debt or credit facilities as of December 31, 2020 and have no immediate plans to enter in such arrangements.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $281.0 million that we expect to utilize, along with cash flow from operations, to provide capital to support the growth of our business, particularly the growth of TPWR, to repurchase our Common Stock subject to market conditions, to pay dividends subject to the discretion of the Board and for general corporate purposes. We believe that cash from operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents balances, will be enough to meet ongoing capital expenditures, working capital requirements and other cash needs for the foreseeable future.\nResults of Operations\nWe operate our business in two segments: Land and Resource Management and Water Services and Operations. We eliminate any inter-segment revenues and expenses upon consolidation.\nWe analyze financial results for each of our reportable segments. The reportable segments presented are consistent with our reportable segments discussed in Note 10, “Business Segment Reporting” in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We monitor our reporting segments based upon revenue and net income calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).\nOur results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been negatively impacted by the economic impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the declines in pricing and demand for crude oil that occurred during 2020. Given the uncertainty surrounding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, our results of operations may continue to be impacted in future periods.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020\nCompared to\nYear Ended December 31, 2019\nRevenues\n. Revenues decreased $187.9 million, or 38.3%, to $302.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $490.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Net income decreased $142.7 million, or 44.8%, to $176.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $318.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Revenues and net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 included a $100 million land sale.  Excluding the impact of the 2019 land sale, revenues and net income (net of income tax) for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $390.5 million and $239.7 million, respectively.\n18\nThe following is an analysis of our operating results for the comparable periods by reportable segment (in thousands):\nLand and Resource Management\nLand and Resource Management segment revenues decreased $168.2 million, or 46.3%, to $195.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared with revenues of $363.3 million for the comparable period of 2019.  Segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, include a $100 million land sale.  Excluding the impact of the $100 million land sale, segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $263.3 million.  The decrease in Land and Resource Management segment revenues is principally due to decreases in land sales and other operating revenue, easements and other surface-related income and oil and gas royalties, all of which are discussed below.\nOil and gas royalties\n. Oil and gas royalty revenue was $137.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $154.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 10.8%.  Oil royalty revenue was $109.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $128.7 million for the comparable period of 2019.  This decrease in oil royalty revenue is principally due to a 24.1% decrease in the average price per royalty barrel of crude oil received, partially offset by an 11.9% increase in crude oil production subject to our royalty interest during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.  Gas royalty revenue was $28.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 10.8% over the year ended December 31, 2019 when gas royalty revenue was $26.0 million. This increase in gas royalty revenue resulted from a volume increase of 27.4%, partially offset by a 6.8% decrease in the average price received for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019.\nEasements and other surface-related income.\nEasements and other surface-related income was $39.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of 46.0% compared to $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Easements and other surface-related income includes pipeline, power line and utility easements, commercial leases, material sales and seismic and temporary permits.  The decrease in easements and other surface-related income is principally related to a decrease of $29.8 million in pipeline easement income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019.  The amount of income derived from pipeline easements is a function of the term of the easement, the size of the easement and the number of easements entered into for any given period.  The demand for pipeline easements is determined by capital decisions made by companies that operate in the areas where we own land.  As such, easements and other surface-related income is unpredictable and may vary significantly from period to period.\n19\nLand sales and other operating revenue\n.  Land sales and other operating revenue includes revenue generated from land sales and grazing leases.  Land sales were $17.4 million and $135.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 22,160 acres of land for an aggregate sales price of approximately $16.0 million, or approximately $721 per acre.  Additionally, the Company recognized land sales revenue of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to land exchanges where the Company had no cost basis in the land conveyed. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold 21,986 acres of land for an aggregate sales price of approximately $113.0 million, or approximately $5,141 per acre.  Additionally, the Company conveyed 5,620 acres of land in exchange for 5,545 acres of land.  As we had no cost basis in the land conveyed, we recognized land sales revenue of $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet income\n. Net income for the Land and Resource Management segment was $128.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.  As discussed above, 2019 revenues for the Land and Resource Management segment included a $100 million land sale.  Excluding the impact of the 2019 land sale (net of income tax), net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $179.4 million.  Expenses, including income tax expense, for the Land and Resource Management segment were $67.1 million and $105.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The decrease in expenses during 2020 is principally related to a $36.7 million decrease in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019.  The overall decrease of $36.7 million in income tax expense is principally due to $21.0 million in income tax expense associated with the $100 million land sale that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2019 and no comparable sale of assets having occurred during the same period of 2020.  Expenses are discussed further below under “Other Financial Data — Consolidated.”\nWater Services and Operations\nWater Services and Operations segment revenues decreased $19.7 million, or 15.5%, to $107.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared with revenues of $127.2 million for the comparable period of 2019.  The decrease in Water Services and Operations segment revenues is due to a decrease in water sales and royalty revenue, partially offset by an increase in easements and other surface-related income, which are discussed below.\nWater sales and royalties\n. Water sales and royalties include sales of water to operators and other customers as well as royalties received pursuant to legacy agreements with operators.  Water sales and royalty revenue was $54.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of $30.1 million or 35.4%, compared with the year ended December 31, 2019 when water sales and royalty revenue was $85.0 million.  The decrease in water sales is principally due to an 18.7% decrease in the average sales price per barrel of water, a 6.8% decrease in the number of barrels sold and a $7.0 million deferral of water sales related to “take or pay” arrangements during the fourth quarter of 2020.  Additionally, water royalties under legacy agreements continue to decline as these agreements have been replaced with agreements between TPWR and operators.  The revenues related to these legacy agreements decreased approximately $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019.\nEasements and other surface-related income\n. Easements and other surface-related income for the Water Services and Operations segment includes pipeline easement royalties, commercial lease royalties and income from temporary permits. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the combined revenue from these revenue streams was $52.6 million as compared to $42.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.  The increase in easements and other surface-related income was principally related to an increase of $11.6 million in produced water royalties for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in temporary permit income over the same time period.\nNet income\n. Net income for the Water Services and Operations segment was $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $60.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.  As discussed above, revenues for the Water Services and Operations segment decreased $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019.  Expenses, including income tax expense, for the Water Services and Operations segment were $59.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $66.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Expenses are discussed further below under “Other Financial Data — Consolidated.”\nOther Financial Data\n—\nConsolidated\nSalaries and related employee expenses\n. Salaries and related employee expenses were $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $35.0 million for the comparable period of 2019.  The decrease in salaries and related employee expenses during 2020 as compared to the same period of 2019 is principally due to decreased usage of contract labor.\n20\nWater service-related expenses\n. Water service-related expenses were $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $20.8 million for the same period of 2019.  This decrease in expenses was principally the result of a decrease in fuel, equipment rental and repairs and maintenance expenses and is directly related to cost saving measures implemented during 2020 and an approximately 6.8% decrease in the number of barrels of sourced and treated water sold, as previously discussed.\nLegal and professional fees\n. Legal and professional fees decreased $5.6 million to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $16.4 million for the comparable period of 2019.  Legal and professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 principally related to our Corporate Reorganization which was effective on January 11, 2021.  Additionally, legal and professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes $1.35 million representing the final specified settlement payment due under the Settlement Agreement.  See further discussion under Item 1. “Business — General — Corporate Reorganization.”   Legal and professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 principally related to the proxy contest to elect a new Trustee, the entry into and payments made under the Settlement Agreement dated July 30, 2019 and the CE Committee.\nLand sales expenses.\nLand sales expenses were $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $0.2 million for the comparable period of 2019.  Land sales expenses represent expenses related to land sales and include cost basis and closing costs associated with land sales.  Land sales expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 include $3.9 million of cost basis.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization was $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.  The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization is principally related to the Company’s investment in water service-related assets placed in service in 2020 and 2019 and to a lesser extent, additional depreciation expense related to the change in estimated useful lives of certain water service-related assets in July 2019 as discussed in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Change in Accounting Estimate.”\nYear Ended December 31, 2019\nCompared to\nYear Ended December 31, 2018\nRevenues\n. Revenues increased $190.3 million, or 63.4%, to $490.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $300.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  Net income increased $109.0 million, or 52.0% to $318.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $209.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n21\nThe following is an analysis of our operating results for the comparable periods by reportable segment (in thousands):\nLand and Resource Management\nLand and Resource Management segment revenues increased $151.9 million, or 71.8%, to $363.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with revenues of $211.5 million for the comparable period of 2018.  The increase in Land and Resource Management segment revenues is due to changes in oil and gas royalty revenue, easements and other surface-related income, sale of oil and gas royalty interests and land sales and other operating revenue, which are discussed below.\nOil and gas royalties\n. Oil and gas royalty revenue was $154.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $123.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 24.9%.  Oil royalty revenue was $128.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $94.6 million for the comparable period of 2018.  This increase in oil royalty revenue is principally due to the effect of a 48.3% increase in crude oil production, subject to our royalty interest, partially offset by a 8.0% decrease in the average price per royalty barrel of crude oil received during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Gas royalty revenue was $26.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 10.9% over the year ended December 31, 2018 when gas royalty revenue was $29.2 million.  This decrease in gas royalty revenue resulted from a 49.3% decrease in the average price received for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018, partially offset by a volume increase of 89.3% over the same time period.\nEasements and other surface-related income\n. Easements and other surface-related income was $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 14.5% compared to $63.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  The increase in easements and other surface-related income is principally related to increases of $4.6 million in pipeline easement income and $3.5 million in commercial lease revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018.  The increase in commercial lease revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to increased leasing activity compared to the same period of 2018. Easements and other surface-related income includes income from pipeline, power line and utility easements, commercial leases (primarily for facilities and roads), material sales and seismic and temporary permits. The amount of income derived from pipeline easements is a function of the term of the easement, the size of the easement and the number of easements entered into for any given period. The demand for pipeline easements is determined by capital decisions made by companies that operate in the areas we own land. As such, easements and other surface-related income is unpredictable and may vary significantly from period to period.\n22\nSale of oil and gas royalty interests.\nThere were no sales of oil and gas royalty interests for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Revenue from the sale of oil and gas royalty interests was $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, when we sold nonparticipating perpetual royalty interests in 812 net royalty acres for an average price of approximately $23,234 per net royalty acre.\nLand sales and other operating revenue\n.   Land sales and other operating revenue includes revenue generated from land sales and grazing leases.  For the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold 21,986 acres of land for total consideration of $113.0 million, or approximately $5,141 per acre.  Additionally, we conveyed 5,620 acres of land in exchange for 5,545 acres of land.  As we had no cost basis in the land conveyed, we recognized land sales revenue of $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, land sales generated $4.4 million of income for selling 171 acres at an average price of $25,464 per acre.\nNet income\n. Net income for the Land and Resource Management segment was $258.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $159.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  As discussed above, revenues for the Land and Resource Management segment increased $151.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018. Expenses, including income tax expense, for the Land and Resource Management segment were $105.0 million and $51.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in expenses was principally related to increased income tax expense associated with the $130.7 million increase in land sales revenue, resulting in additional income tax expense of approximately $27.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018.  Through §1031 exchanges, income tax expense of approximately $19.8 million was eligible for deferral for the year ended December 31, 2019.  The remaining increase was principally related to increased legal and professional fees and salaries and related employee expenses.  See further discussion of these expenses below under “Other Financial Data — Consolidated.”\nWater Services and Operations\nWater Services and Operations segment revenues increased $38.4 million, or 43.3%, to $127.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared with revenues of $88.7 million for the comparable period of 2018.  The increase in Water Services and Operations segment revenues is due to increases in water sales and royalty revenue and easements and other surface-related income, which are discussed below.\nWater sales and royalties\n. Water sales and royalty revenue was $85.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 32.9% compared with the for the year ended December 31, 2018 when water sales and royalty revenue was $63.9 million.  This increase was principally due to a 44.0% increase in the number of barrels of sourced and treated water sold during the year ended December 31, 2019 over the same period in 2018, partially offset by decreased water royalties.\nEasements and other surface-related income\n. Easements and other surface-related income for the Water Services and Operations segment includes pipeline easement royalties, commercial lease royalties and income from temporary permits. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the combined revenue from these revenue streams was $42.2 million as compared to $24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  The increase in easements and other surface-related income was principally related to an increase of $21.5 million in produced water royalties for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018, partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease in temporary permit income over the same time period.\nNet income\n. Net income for the Water Services and Operations segment was $60.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $50.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  As discussed above, revenues for the Water Services and Operations segment increased $38.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period of 2018.  Expenses, including income tax expense, for the Water Services and Operations segment were $66.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  The increase in expenses during 2019 is primarily related to increased water service-related operating expenses,  principally fuel, repairs and maintenance and equipment rental related to sourcing and transfer of water.  The remaining increase was principally related to increased salaries and related employee expenses as discussed further below under “Other Financial Data — Consolidated.”\nOther Financial Data\n—\nConsolidated\nSalaries and related employee expenses\n. Salaries and related employee expenses were $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $18.4 million for the comparable period of 2018. The increase in salaries and related employee expenses is directly related to the increase in the number of employees from 64 employees as of December 31, 2018 to 94 as of December 31, 2019 as well as additional contract labor expenses over the same time period.\n23\nWater service-related expenses\n. Water service-related expenses were $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $11.2 million for the same period of 2018.  This increase in expenses was principally the result of an increase in fuel and repairs and maintenance expenses to source and transfer water and is directly related to the 44.0% sales increase in the number of barrels of sourced and treated water sold as previously discussed.\nGeneral\nand administrative\nexpenses\n. General and administrative expenses increased $4.9 million to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $4.7 million for the same period of 2018.  The increase in general and administrative expenses is principally related to increased expenses associated with our independent contractor service providers, computer-related software and services, and additional liability insurance.\nLegal and professional fees\n. Legal and professional fees increased $13.9 million to $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $2.5 million for the comparable period of 2018.  The increase in legal and professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 is principally due to approximately $13.0 million of legal and professional fees related to the proxy contest to elect a new Trustee, the entry into and payments made under the Settlement Agreement dated July 30, 2019 and the CE Committee.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization was $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization is principally related to the Company’s investment in water service-related assets placed in service in 2019 and the latter half of 2018 and to a lesser extent, additional depreciation expense related to the change in estimated useful lives of certain water service-related assets in July 2019.\nCash Flow Analysis\nYear Ended December 31, 2020\nCompared to\nYear Ended December 31, 2019\nCash flows provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $207.0 million and $342.8 million, respectively.  Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 included proceeds from a $100 million land sale consummated in January 2019.  The decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily related to decreased proceeds from land sales, oil and gas royalties, easements and other surface-related payments received and water sales and royalties collected during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCash flows used in investing activities were $26.0 million compared to $111.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Acquisitions of land and purchases of fixed assets decreased a combined $97.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019.  This decrease was partially offset by the $11.9 million increase in the acquisition of royalty interests during the same comparison periods.\nCash flows used in financing activities were $201.7 million compared to $50.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  During the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid total dividends of $201.7 million consisting of a regular cash dividend of $10.00 per Sub-share and special dividends aggregating $16.00 per Sub-share.  During the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid total dividends of $46.5 million consisting of a regular cash dividend of $1.75 per Sub-share and a special dividend of $4.25 per Sub-share.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019\nCompared to\nYear Ended December 31, 2018\nCash flows provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $342.8 million and $195.4 million, respectively. This increase in operating cash flows is principally due to increases in proceeds from land sales, oil and gas royalties, easements and other surface-related payments received and water sales and royalties during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCash flows used in investing activities were $111.7 million compared to $81.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increased use of investing cash flows is principally due to our acquisition of 21,671 acres of land in Texas for approximately $74.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019.  This increase was partially offset by a $19.3 million decrease in acquisitions of royalty interests and a $15.7 million reduction in capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018.\nCash flows used in financing activities were $50.9 million compared to $70.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  During the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid total dividends of $46.5 million consisting of a regular cash dividend of $1.75 per Sub-share and a special dividend of $4.25 per Sub-share.  During the year\n24\nended December 31, 2018, we paid total dividends of $31.7 million consisting of a regular cash dividend of $1.05 per Sub-share and a special dividend of $3.00 per Sub-share.  During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we paid $4.4 million and $38.4 million, respectively, to repurchase Sub-shares.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company’s contractual obligations were as follows (in thousands):\n(1)\nIncludes office leases for our corporate office in Dallas, Texas which expires in 2025 and for our office in Midland, Texas which expires in 2022.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our operating results. We cannot assure you, however, that future increases in our costs will not occur or that any such increases that may occur will not adversely affect our results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. It is our opinion that we fully disclose our significant accounting policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Consistent with our disclosure policies, we include the following discussion related to what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgment.\nAccrual of Oil and Gas Royalties\nThe Company accrues oil and gas royalties.  An accrual is necessary due to the time lag between the production of oil and gas and generation of the actual payment by operators.  The oil and gas royalty accrual is based upon historical payments, estimates of the timing of future payments and recent market prices for oil and gas.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor further information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”"

Mr. Barry and Mr. Norris serve as Co-Chairs of the Board.\nThe Board intends to meet at least quarterly and the independent directors serving on the Board intend to meet in executive session (i.e., without the presence of any non-independent directors and management) immediately following regularly scheduled Board meetings.  During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 (the “Last Fiscal Year”), the Trustees met seven (7) times and acted two (2) times by unanimous written consent in lieu of holding a meeting. Mr. Barry and Mr. Norris, each of whom was a Trustee during the Last Fiscal Year, attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings held by the Trustees and of the committees on which they served during the Last Fiscal Year.\nThe Board has three standing committees, consisting of a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, an Audit Committee, and a Compensation Committee.

    "text": "Compensation Discussion and Analysis\nTPL’s executive compensation program is designed to reward the performance of each of TPL’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and up to three other most highly compensated individuals who were serving as an executive officer at the end of the Last Fiscal Year, and up to two other individuals who would have been included as other most highly compensated individuals but were not serving as executive officers at the end of the Last Fiscal Year, for services rendered in all capacities during the Last Fiscal Year (the “Named Executive Officers”) in achieving TPL’s primary goals of protecting and maintaining the assets of TPL. The executive compensation program consists principally of a salary and an annual cash bonus. Base salaries provide our Named Executive Officers with a steady income stream that is not contingent on TPL’s performance, while the addition of a cash bonus allows the Compensation Committee flexibility to recognize and reward the Named Executive Officers’ contributions to TPL’s performance in a given year. Salaries are reviewed annually and salary increases and the amounts of cash bonuses are determined by the Compensation Committee based upon an evaluation of the Named Executive Officer’s performance and contributions, as well as overall performance of the Company, against the goals and objectives of TPL in accordance with the relevant employment agreements in effect.  See “Employment Agreements” below.  In accordance with the employment agreements, final bonus amounts for a completed year may be finalized during the first quarter of the following year. Prior to the Corporate Reorganization, executive compensation was determined by the Nominating, Compensation and Governance Committee of the Trust, although bonuses for fiscal year 2020 for Messrs. Glover and Packer were determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company.  Differences in salary for the Named Executive Officers may reflect the differing responsibilities of their respective positions, the differing levels of experience of the individuals and internal pay equity considerations.\nTPL has not incorporated equity-related or other long-term compensation elements in its compensation programs in light of our historical corporate structure as a business trust.  As part of its compensation program, TPL maintains both a qualified defined benefit pension plan and a qualified defined contribution plan which are both available to employees generally, as well as to the Named Executive Officers. These plans are designed to assist employees in planning adequately for their retirement.\nThe Compensation Committee has the sole authority to determine the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer, and to make recommendations to the Board with respect to the compensation of the Named Executive Officers other than the Chief Executive Officer.  Prior to the Corporate Reorganization, the Nominating, Compensation and Governance Committee had the sole authority to determine the compensation of the Named Executive Officers.\n31\nCompensation Consultant\nIn 2020, TPL engaged Alvarez & Marsal (“A&M”) as an independent compensation consultant to the Nominating, Compensation and Governance Committee of the Trust. A&M reported to, and worked at the direction of the Trust’s Nominating, Compensation and Governance Committee. A&M provides no services to and earns no fees from the Trust outside of its engagement with the Nominating, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committee of the Trust. The Trust’s Nominating, Compensation and Governance Committee determined that A&M is independent from management based upon the consideration of various relevant factors, including that A&M did not provide any services to the Trust except advisory services to the Nominating, Compensation and Governance Committee, and that A&M has and adheres to policies and procedures that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest.\nTo provide assistance in setting initial compensation for non-employee directors of TPL, the Trust retained A&M. A&M presented to the CE Committee regarding appropriate compensation for non-employee directors and the initial non-employee director compensation levels were set based upon the information provided by A&M and in consultation with those who have agreed to serve as non-employee directors of the Board.\nEffective January 11, 2021, as part of the Corporate Reorganization, the Board formed the current Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee engaged A&M to assist with determination of bonuses for certain executive officers, as discussed above.  During 2021, the Compensation Committee is expected to select an independent compensation consultant to assist the Compensation Committee in fulfilling its responsibilities related to the oversight of TPL Corporation’s executive officer and non-employee director compensation. In general, we expect the independent compensation consultant to develop pay strategies regarding our executive officers, including our CEO, and non-employee directors, which the consultant will provide to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee and the consultant will then review and discuss matters involving executive officer and non-employee director compensation. After this review, we expect that the Compensation Committee will make its own recommendations to the Board regarding, among other things (a) the compensation of the CEO and other executive officers including salary, bonus, fees, benefits, incentive awards and perquisites and (b) compensation for TPL’s non-employee directors.  The Compensation Committee is also responsible for developing and overseeing an equity compensation program for the Company generally, including for employees and non-employee directors, with assistance from the compensation consultant.\nSummary Compensation Table\nThe following table sets forth information concerning compensation for services in all capacities awarded to, earned by, or paid to, the Named Executive Officers:\n32\n(1)\nRepresents the bonus amount approved by the Compensation Committee, with respect to Mr. Glover and Mr. Packer for 2020, and the Trustees with respect to Mr. Dobbs for 2020 and all Named Executive Officers for 2019.  Bonuses for 2020 and 2019 were accrued as of the respective year end and were paid and/or expected to be paid on or before March 15 of the applicable year.  Mr. Dobbs’ 2020 bonus amount includes a $100,000 sign-on bonus that was paid during 2020.  Mr. Parasnis's 2019 bonus amount includes a $50,000 bonus that was paid during 2019.\n(2)\nRepresents the aggregate change in the actuarial present value of the Named Executive Officer’s accumulated benefit under TPL’s pension plan over the prior year.  For further information regarding TPL’s pension plan, see Note 6, “Employee Benefit Plans” in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n(3)\nRepresents contributions by TPL to the account of the Named Executive Officer under the Trust’s defined contribution retirement plan.\n(4)\nThe aggregate value of the perquisites and other personal benefits, if any, received by the Named Executive Officers for all years presented have not been reflected in the table because the amount was below the SEC’s $10,000 threshold for disclosure except for Mr. Glover, whose perquisites consisted of $14,400 in automobile allowance for 2020, and Mr. Packer, whose perquisites consisted of $14,400 and $10,594 in automobile allowance for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(5)\nMr. Dobbs joined TPL as Senior Vice President and General Counsel effective August 3, 2020.  As of December 31, 2020, Mr. Dobbs was not eligible to participate in TPL’s defined benefit and actuarial pension plans.\n(6)\nMr. Parasnis joined TPL as Chief Commercial Officer and Executive Vice President effective July 1, 2019.  As of December 31, 2019, Mr. Parasnis was not eligible to participate in TPL’s defined benefit and actuarial pension plans.  Effective June 24, 2020, Mr. Parasnis’s employment with TPL ceased.\nPay Ratio\nDisclosure\nFor purposes of calculating the 2020 ratio of the median annual total compensation of all employees to the total annual compensation of the Chief Executive Officer, TPL included base salary and annual bonus amounts in its calculation of annual total compensation.  We used December 31, 2020 as the measurement date.  Base salary amounts were annualized for any employee who had less than a full year of service during 2020. Total compensation for Mr. Glover, the Trust’s Chief Executive Officer, was determined to be $2,890,000 and was approximately 26 times the median annual compensation of all of our employees, excluding the Chief Executive Officer, of $111,000.  For purposes of this calculation, the Trust had 101 employees, excluding the Chief Executive Officer.\nEmployment Agreements\nMessrs. Glover, Packer and Parasnis\nOn August 8, 2019, the Trust entered into employment agreements (the “Agreements”) with Mr. Glover, its General Agent and Chief Executive Officer (the “Glover Agreement”), Mr. Packer, its General Agent and Chief Financial Officer (the “Packer Agreement”) and Mr. Parasnis, its Chief Commercial Officer and Executive Vice President (the “Parasnis Agreement”). The Agreements were effective as of July 1, 2019.  In connection with the Corporate Reorganization, TPL entered into amended and restated agreements with each of Mr. Glover and Mr. Packer, described below.  Effective June 24, 2020, Mr. Parasnis’s employment with TPL ceased and the Parasnis Agreement was terminated.\nUnder the Agreements, Mr. Glover and Mr. Packer received a base salary of $800,000 per annum and Mr. Parasnis received a base salary of $700,000 per annum, subject to annual review, and were eligible for an annual cash bonus of up to 300% of such base salary for achievement of specified performance targets, except that with respect to Mr. Glover and Mr. Packer, the cash bonus for the calendar year 2019 was at least 100% of the cash bonus paid with respect to 2018, as established by the Nominating, Compensation and Governance Committee of the Trust. Until the Trust establishes an equity compensation plan, Mr. Glover, Mr. Packer and Mr. Parasnis are required to use at least 25% of their cash bonuses (net of estimated taxes) to purchase Sub-Shares. The term of each of the Glover Agreement and the Packer Agreement ended on December 31, 2020, with automatic one (1) year extensions unless notice not to renew is given by either party at least 120 days prior to the relevant end date.  The term of the Parasnis Agreement was to end on December 31, 2022, with automatic one (1) year extensions unless notice not to renew is given by either party at least 120 days prior to the relevant end date.  Under the Parasnis Agreement, the cash bonus for 2019 was prorated for the period of employment during such year.  Additionally, Mr. Parasnis was entitled to a retention bonus in the amount of $875,000, payable in three installments on March 15, 2020 and the second and third anniversaries of the effective date of the Parasnis Agreement and was eligible for a relocation allowance in the amount of $100,000 to cover his relocation to Dallas, Texas.\nEach Agreement provided for payment of severance benefits if the officer’s employment is terminated by the Trust without cause or by the officer for good reason, provided that the officer executes a general waiver and release of claims and\n33\ncomplies with the restrictive covenants described below.  The severance benefits include (i) accrued but unpaid bonuses and vested long-term incentive benefits (ii) a pro rata bonus for the year of termination (if such termination occurs after the first calendar quarter), (iii) up to 18 months of COBRA premiums for continued group health, dental and vision coverage for the officer and his dependents, paid for by the Trust, (iv) if such termination occurs during the first 15 months (30 months for Mr. Parasnis) of the term, an amount equal to two times the average of his base salary and cash bonus for the preceding two years (for Mr. Parasnis, annualized for any partial year other than 2019), which amount will be reduced to one times such average for the preceding year if such termination occurs after the first 15 months (30 months for Mr. Parasnis) of the term and (v) for Mr. Parasnis, any unpaid portion of his retention bonus and relocation allowance.  If the officer’s employment is terminated by the Trust without cause, by the officer for good reason, or upon failure of the Trust to renew the term of the Agreement, in all such cases, within 24 months following a change in control of the Trust as defined in the Agreements, then, in lieu of the amount specified in clause (iv), the officer will be entitled to an amount equal to 2.99 times the greater of (a) the average of his base salary and cash bonus for the two years preceding the change in control and (b) his base salary and target cash bonus for the year of the change in control, except that, with respect to Mr. Parasnis, if the change in control occurred in 2019, the amount of the change in control severance would be 50% of the otherwise applicable amount.  If the officer's employment terminates due to death or disability, he will be entitled to the benefits described in clauses (i), (ii) and for Mr. Parasnis, (v) above.  The officer will also be entitled to payment of accrued but unpaid salary, accrued but unused vacation, unsubsidized COBRA benefits, and unreimbursed business expenses following termination of employment for any reason.\nThe Agreements provided that Mr. Glover, Mr. Packer and Mr. Parasnis were entitled to participate in all benefit plans provided to the Trust’s executives of like status from time to time in accordance with the applicable plan, policy or practices of the Trust, as well as in any long-term incentive program established by the Trust.  They also provided for four weeks of annual paid vacation, reimbursement of business expenses, and indemnification rights.\nEach Agreement contained restrictive covenants prohibiting the officer from disclosing the Trust’s confidential information at any time, from competing with the Trust in specified counties where the Trust does business during his employment, subject to certain exceptions, and for one year thereafter (or six months thereafter if he terminates his employment voluntarily without good reason), and from soliciting the Trust’s clients, suppliers and business partners during his employment and for one year thereafter.\nAs noted above, effective upon the Corporate Reorganization on January 11, 2021, TPL entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with each of Messrs. Glover and Packer to (i) confirm the assumption by TPL of the obligations of the Trust under the Glover Agreement and the Packer Agreement and (ii) to reflect the increase in base salary for each of Messrs. Glover and Packer to $850,000 and the change of the end of the term of each of the Glover Agreement and the Packer Agreement to December 31, 2021. The amended and restated employment agreements are otherwise identical in all material respects to the Glover Agreement and the Packer Agreement.\nMr. Dobbs\nEffective upon the Corporate Reorganization on January 11, 2021, TPL entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Dobbs, its Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary (the “Dobbs Agreement”).\nUnder the Dobbs Agreement, Mr. Dobbs will receive a base salary of $400,000 per annum, subject to annual review, and be eligible for an annual cash bonus of up to 100% of such base salary for achievement of specified performance targets as established by the Compensation Committee. Until TPL establishes an equity compensation plan, Mr. Dobbs is required to use at least 25% of his cash bonus (net of estimated taxes) to purchase shares of Common Stock. The term of the Dobbs Agreement ends on December 31, 2021, with automatic one (1) year extensions unless notice not to renew is given by either party at least 120 days prior to the relevant end date.\nThe Dobbs Agreement provides for payment of severance benefits if the officer’s employment is terminated by TPL without cause or by the officer for good reason, provided that the officer executes a general waiver and release of claims and complies with the restrictive covenants described below. The severance benefits include (i) accrued but unpaid bonuses and vested long-term incentive benefits (ii) a pro rata bonus for the year of termination (if such termination occurs after the first calendar quarter), (iii) up to 18 months of COBRA premiums for continued group health, dental and vision coverage for the officer and his dependents, paid for by TPL, and (iv) if such termination occurs during the first 15 months of the term, an amount equal to two times the average of his base salary and cash bonus for the preceding two years, which amount will be reduced to one times such average for the preceding year if such termination occurs after the first 15 months of the term. If Mr. Dobb’s employment is terminated by TPL without cause, by the officer for good reason, or upon failure of TPL to renew the term of the Agreement, in all such cases, within 24 months following a change in control of TPL as defined in the Dobbs Agreement, then, in lieu of the amount specified in clause (iv), Mr. Dobbs will be entitled to an amount equal to 2.99 times the\n34\ngreater of (a) the average of his base salary and cash bonus for the two years preceding the change in control and (b) his base salary and target cash bonus for the year of the change in control. If Mr. Dobbs’ employment terminates due to death or disability, he will be entitled to the benefits described in clauses (i) and (ii) above. Mr. Dobbs will also be entitled to payment of accrued but unpaid salary, accrued but unused vacation, unsubsidized COBRA benefits, and unreimbursed business expenses following termination of employment for any reason.\nThe Dobbs Agreement provides that Mr. Dobbs will be entitled to participate in all benefit plans provided to TPL’s executives of like status from time to time in accordance with the applicable plan, policy or practices of TPL, as well as in any long-term incentive program established by the TPL. It also provides for four weeks of annual paid vacation, reimbursement of business expenses, and indemnification rights.\nThe Dobbs Agreement contains restrictive covenants prohibiting Mr. Dobbs from disclosing TPL’s confidential information at any time, and from soliciting TPL’s clients, suppliers and business partners during his employment and for one year thereafter.\nPension Benefits\n(1)\nMr. Dobbs joined TPL as Senior Vice President and General Counsel effective August 3, 2020.  As of December 31, 2020, Mr. Dobbs was not eligible to participate in TPL’s pension plan.\n(2)    Mr. Parasnis joined TPL as Chief Commercial Officer and Executive Vice President effective July 1, 2019.  Effective June 24, 2020, Mr Parasnis’s employment with TPL ceased.  As of December 31, 2019, Mr. Parasnis was not eligible to participate in TPL’s pension plan.\nThe Restated Texas Pacific Land Trust Revised Employees’ Pension Plan, renamed the Restated Texas Pacific Land Corporation Revised Employees’ Pension Plan as of the Corporate Reorganization, is a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan qualified under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code in which our eligible employees participate (the “Pension Plan”). The remuneration covered by the Pension Plan is generally the participant's base compensation up to certain limits specified in the Internal Revenue Code (“Eligible Compensation”). The Pension Plan generally provides a normal retirement benefit equal to 1.5% of a participant’s average Eligible Compensation for the last five years of the participant’s Credited Service multiplied by each year of Credited Service under the Pension Plan. Credited Service is earned from the participant’s date of membership in the Pension Plan, which is generally the earlier of January 1 or July 1 following completion of the participant’s first year of service for TPL. For information concerning the valuation method and material assumptions used in quantifying the present value of the Named Executive Officers’ current accrued benefits, see Note 6, “Employee Benefit Plans” of the Notes to Financial Statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of this Report.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the annual accrued normal retirement benefits are estimated to be $30,030 and $32,258 for Mr. Glover and Mr. Packer, respectively.\nThe Pension Plan provides for early retirement after the participant attains age 50 and completes 20 years of continuous service with TPL.  Early retirement benefits are calculated in the same manner as the normal retirement benefit, but are reduced by 1/15 for each of the first five years and 1/30 for each of the next five years that benefits commence prior to the Pension Plan's normal retirement age of 65.  If benefits commence more than 10 years prior to normal retirement, the early retirement benefit is reduced actuarially for each year prior to age 55.  None of the Named Executive Officers are currently eligible for early retirement benefits.\n35\nDirectors’ Compensation\nAs discussed in Item 10. “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance,” our Corporate Reorganization was completed on January 11, 2021 and included a change in our governance structure to a board of directors from our previous structure of being governed by Trustees.  As our Board did not assume their current role as director until January 11, 2021, only Mr. Barry and Mr. Norris, in their former roles as Trustees, received compensation during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following table sets forth information concerning compensation paid to the Trustees during the year ended December 31, 2020:\nThe Trustees did not receive additional compensation for service on a committee or for attendance at meetings in 2020.\nAll of the non-employee directors of the Board began such service on January 11, 2021.  However, during late 2020, they participated in orientation and transition activities in order to be better prepared when their Board service began, and they received compensation for such participation as follows:\nCompensation\nCommittee\nInterlocks\nand\nInsider\nParticipation\nPrior to our Corporate Reorganization effective January 11, 2021, each of the Trustees was a member of the Nominating, Compensation and Governance Committee of the Trustees. None of the Trustees was an officer or employee of TPL.  None of the Trustees had any relationship requiring disclosure by the Trust pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K. There are no interlocking relationships requiring disclosure by the Trust pursuant to Item 407(e)(4)(iii) of Regulation S-K.\nCompensation Committee Report\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Item 11 with management and, based on such review and discussion, recommended that it be included in this Report.\nBarbara J. Duganier\nDonald G. Cook\nDana F. McGinnis\n36"

Financial Statements.\nINDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAll schedules have been omitted because the required information is contained in the consolidated financial statements or related notes, or is not applicable or immaterial.\n43\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nTexas Pacific Land Corporation\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Texas Pacific Land Trust (the “Trust”), known since January 11, 2021 as Texas Pacific Land Corporation, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the related consolidated statements of income and total comprehensive income, net proceeds from all sources, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Trust as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also, in our opinion, the Trust maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Trust’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trust’s financial statements and an opinion on the Trust’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nF-1\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA trust’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A trust’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Trust; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Trust are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Trust; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Trust’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccrual of Oil and Gas Royalties\nAs described in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Trust records an accrual, based on historical trends, for oil and gas royalty revenues not received during the month removed.  At December 31, 2020, this oil and gas royalty accrual amounted to approximately $20,671,000, and is included in accrued receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  The accrual is necessary due to the time lag between the production of oil and gas and the generation of the actual payment by operators, which is typically a time lag of one to two months.  The determination of the oil and gas royalty accrual involves the analysis of historical payments, estimates of the timing of future payments, and consideration of recent market prices for oil and gas.  The market prices for oil and gas are subject to national and international economic and political considerations and, in the past, have been subject to significant price fluctuations.  As part of the Trust’s internal control process related to estimating the accrual of oil and gas royalties, the estimate is prepared by a qualified member of the Trust’s accounting department, and the estimate is reviewed and approved by a management-level member of the accounting department.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the oil and gas royalty accrual is a critical audit matter are there are significant judgments by management when developing the estimate of the oil and gas royalty accrual.  This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the significant assumptions used by management, including the analysis of historical payments, estimates of the timing of future payments, and consideration of recent market prices for oil and gas.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements.  These procedures included testing the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls relating to management’s calculation of the oil and gas royalty accrual.  These procedures also included, among others, (1) evaluating whether the methods used by management to develop the estimate are in conformity with the requirements of generally accepted accounting principles and appropriate for the nature of the related accounts and disclosures, while giving consideration to the Trust and its environment; (2) testing management’s process used to develop the accounting estimate; (3) evaluating the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in management’s estimate and whether the data was appropriately used by the Trust in developing the estimate; and (4) identifying and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management in developing the estimate.\nF-2\nCritical Audit Matter (Continued)\nEvaluating the significant assumptions relating to the estimate of the oil and gas royalty accrual also involved evaluating various factors, both individually and in combination, including evaluating whether (1) the Trust has a  reasonable basis for the significant assumptions used, and (2) the significant assumptions are consistent with relevant industry, regulatory and other external factors, as well as economic conditions; the Trust’s objectives, strategies, and related business risks; existing market information; historical or recent experience, taking into account changes in conditions or events affecting the Trust; and other significant assumptions used by management.\nWe have served as the Trust’s auditor since 2004.\nDallas, Texas\nFebruary 25, 2021\nF-3\nTEXAS PACIFIC LAND TRUST\nCONSOLIDATED\nBALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-4\nTEXAS PACIFIC LAND TRUST\nCONSOLIDATED\nSTATEMENTS OF INCOME AND TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-5\nTEXAS PACIFIC LAND TRUST\nCONSOLIDATED\nSTATEMENTS OF NET PROCEEDS FROM ALL SOURCES\n(in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-6\nTEXAS PACIFIC LAND TRUST\nCONSOLIDATED\nSTATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-7\nTEXAS PACIFIC LAND TRUST\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nOrganization and Description of Business Segments\nTexas Pacific Land Trust (which, together with its subsidiaries as the context requires, may be referred to as “TPL”, the “Trust”, “our”, “we” or “us”) is one of the largest landowners in the State of Texas with approximately\n880,000\nacres of land in West Texas.  Additionally, we own a 1/128th nonparticipating perpetual oil and gas royalty interest (“NPRI”) under approximately\n85,000\nacres of land, a 1/16th NPRI under approximately\n371,000\nacres of land, and  approximately\n4,000\nadditional net royalty acres (normalized to 1/8th) in the western part of Texas.\nTPL was organized to manage land, including royalty interests, for the benefit of its owners. TPL’s income is derived primarily from oil and gas royalties, sales of water and land, easements and commercial leases of the land.\nWe operate our business in\ntwo\nsegments: Land and Resource Management and Water Services and Operations. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives of TPL and provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses. See Note 10, “Business Segment Reporting” for further information regarding our segments.\nOn January 11, 2021, we completed our reorganization from a business trust to a corporation (the “Corporate Reorganization”) and changed our name from Texas Pacific Land Trust to Texas Pacific Land Corporation.  See further discussion in Note 11, “Subsequent Events” regarding the Corporate Reorganization.  The financial statements to which these notes relate are for Texas Pacific Land Trust, prior to the Corporate Reorganization.\n2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation and\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include our consolidated accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nChange in Accounting Estimate\nManagement evaluates its estimates on a routine basis.  Effective July 1, 2019, TPL revised the estimated useful lives of certain water service-related assets after its disaggregation of water service-related projects into sub classifications.  TPL purchased these water service-related assets from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2019.  Based on information gained from operations over this time period, management believes that these water service-related assets will benefit periods ranging from\nthree\nto\n30\nyears, beginning at the point the water service-related assets were originally placed in service.\nThe net book value of these water service-related assets at June 30, 2019, was not modified and is depreciated over the revised estimated useful lives of these assets.  The effect of the change in estimated useful lives resulted in an additional $\n2.4\nmillion of depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRevenue Recognition\nOil and\nGas\nRoyalties\nOil and gas royalties are received in connection with royalty interests owned by TPL. Oil and gas royalties are reported net of production taxes and are recognized as revenue when crude oil and gas products are removed from the respective mineral reserve locations. Oil and gas royalty payments are generally received\none\nto\ntwo months\nafter the crude oil and gas products\nF-8\nare removed. An accrual is included in accrued receivables for amounts not received during the month removed based on historical trends.\nThe oil and gas royalties which we receive are dependent upon the market prices for oil and gas. The market prices for oil and gas are subject to national and international economic and political conditions and subject to significant price fluctuations.\nTPL has analyzed public reports of drilling activities by the oil companies operating where we have an oil and gas royalty interest in an effort to identify unpaid royalties associated with royalty interests we own. Rights to certain oil and gas royalties we believe to be due and payable may be subject to dispute with the oil company involved as a result of disagreements with respect to drilling and related engineering information. Disputed oil and gas royalties are recorded when these contingencies are resolved.\nEasements and\nOther Surface-Related Income\nEasement contracts represent contracts which permit companies to install pipe lines, electric lines and other equipment on land owned by TPL. When TPL receives a signed contract and payment, we make available the respective parcel of land to the grantee.  Easement income is recognized upon the execution of the easement agreement, or in the event of a renewal upon receipt of the renewal payment, as at that point in time, we have satisfied its performance obligation and the customer has right of use.\nOther surface-related income includes commercial lease income related to leasing arrangements to companies in a wide array of industries, including: agricultural, oil and gas, construction, wind power, solar farms and other industries. Commercial lease income is recognized when earned. These leases generally require fixed annual payments or royalties and lease terms are typically\nten years\n. Lease cancellations are allowed under certain circumstances, but initial lease payments are generally nonrefundable.  Advance lease payments are deferred and amortized over the appropriate accounting period. Lease payments not received are included in accrued receivables.  Additionally, other surface-related income includes permit income and material sales.  Revenue from these sources is recognized when earned.\nWater\nSales and\nRoyalties\nWater sales and royalty revenue encompasses sales of water to operators and other customers and royalties received pursuant to legacy agreements with operators. The earnings cycle for both revenue streams is complete upon delivery of water. Water sales and royalty revenue is recognized as earned.\nLand\nSales and Exchanges\nWe consider purchasers of land to be our customers as land management, leasing and sales are normal operating activities for TPL.  Revenue is recognized on land sales when the performance obligation to the purchaser (customer) is complete.  Revenue from land exchanges is recognized based upon the estimated fair value of the consideration exchanged.\nSales of Oil and Gas Royalty Interests\nIncome is recognized on sales of oil and gas royalty interests when earned.\nCash,\nCash\nEquivalents and Restricted Cash\nWe consider investments in bank deposits, money market funds and highly-liquid cash investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the condensed consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):\nF-9\nAccrued Receivables\nAccrued receivables consist primarily of amounts due under oil and gas royalty leases, water sales or royalty agreements and commercial leases.  An allowance is recorded for expected credit losses and is based upon our historical write-off experience, aging of trade accounts receivable and collectability patterns of our customers.  As of December 31, 2020, the allowance for expected credit losses was less than $\n0.1\nmillion.\nNo\nallowance was considered necessary as of December 31, 2019.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with our development of infrastructure for sourcing and treating water are capitalized. We account for depreciation of property, plant and equipment on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nDepreciable lives by category are as follows:\nReal Estate Acquired\nReal estate acquired is recorded at cost and carried at the lower of cost or market. Valuations are periodically performed or obtained by management whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairments, if any, are recorded by a charge to net income and a valuation allowance if the carrying value of the property exceeds its estimated fair value. Minimal real estate improvements are made to land.  No impairments were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nRoyalty Interests Acquired\nWe follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our royalty interests acquired, which are carried at the lower of cost or market. Valuations are periodically performed or obtained by management whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairments, if any, are recorded by a charge to net income and a reduction in the carrying value of our royalty interests if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value.\nNo\nimpairments were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nDepletion is recorded based upon a units of production basis.  Depletion expense was approximately $\n0.4\nmillion and $\n0.3\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  There was\nno\ndepletion expense for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nReal Estate and Royalty Interests Assigned Through the 1888 Declaration of Trust\nThe fair market value of the Trust’s land and royalty interests that were assigned through the 1888 Declaration of Trust, (referred to as “Assigned”) land and royalty interests, was not determined in 1888 when the Trust was formed; therefore, no value is assigned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets to the Assigned land and royalty interests, Certificates of Proprietary Interest, and Sub-share Certificates of Proprietary Interest (“Sub-shares”).  Consequently, in the consolidated statements of income and total comprehensive income, no allowance is made for depletion and no cost is deducted from the proceeds of sales of the Assigned land and royalty interests. Even though the 1888 value of real properties cannot be precisely determined, it has been concluded that the effect of this matter can no longer be significant to the Trust’s financial position or results of operations. For Federal income tax purposes, however, deductions are made for depletion, computed on the statutory percentage basis of income received from royalties. Minimal real estate improvements are made to land.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax\nF-10\ncredit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nWhen tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is\nzero\nas of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nWe invest our cash and cash equivalents (which include U.S. Treasury bills and commercial paper with maturities of three months or less) among\nthree\nmajor financial institutions in an attempt to minimize exposure to risk from any one of these entities. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents deposited in our financial institutions in excess of federally-insured levels. We regularly monitor the financial condition of these financial institutions and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash and cash equivalents.\nNet\nIncome per Sub-share\nNet income per Sub-share is based on the weighted average number of Sub-shares and equivalent Sub-shares outstanding during each period.\nPurchases and Retirements of Sub-shares\nThe costs of Sub-shares purchased and retired are charged to net proceeds from all sources.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting capital that, under GAAP, are excluded from net income.\nSignificant Customers\nTwo customers represented, in the aggregate,\n28.3\n%,\n36.5\n% and\n31.3\n% of the TPL’s total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nReclassifications\nCertain financial information on the consolidated statements of income as of and for the\nyears ended\nDecember 31, 2019 and 2018 have been revised to conform to the current year presentation.\nThese revisions include a reclassification of $\n0.2\nmillion of land sales expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 and less than $\n0.1\nmillion for the same period of 2018 previously included in general and administrative expenses to a separate financial statement line item within operating expenses.  Land sales expenses include cost basis and closing costs associated with land sales.  T\notal assets and expenses were not affected by these reclassifications.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance\nCredit Losses\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, “\nFinancial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326):  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.”\nThe ASU amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach based on expected losses to\nF-11\nestimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables.  The Trust adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2020.  Due to the short-term nature of our trade accounts receivable, the adoption of this guidance had a minimal impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, “\nCompensation — Retirement Benefits — Defined Benefit Plans — General (Subtopic 715-20):  Disclosure Framework — Changes to Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans\n.”  The ASU eliminates requirements for certain disclosures and requires additional disclosures under defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement plans.  The Trust adopted the guidance as of December 31, 2020.  The impacts to the Trust’s footnote disclosures were limited to adding a narrative description of reasons for any significant gains and losses affecting the benefit obligation and omitting any disclosure regarding amounts expected to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income over the next year.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740) — Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.”\nThe ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, hybrid taxes and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. It also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in interim or annual periods with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2021, had a minimal impact on the Trust’s consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n3.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment, net consisted of the following as of  December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\n(1)\nWater service-related assets reflect assets related to water sourcing and water treatment projects.\nDepreciation expense was $\n13.8\nmillion, $\n8.5\nmillion and $\n2.6\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nF-12\n4.\nReal Estate Activity\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, TPL owned the following land and real estate (in thousands, except number of acres):\n(1)\nReal estate assigned through the 1888 Declaration of Trust.\nNo valuation allowance was necessary as of  December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nLand Sales\nThe Assigned land held by TPL was recorded with no value at the time of acquisition.  See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Real Estate and Royalty Interests Assigned Through the 1888 Declaration of Trust” for further information regarding the Assigned land.  Real estate acquired includes land parcels which have either been acquired through foreclosure or transactions with third parties.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold\n22,160\nacres of land in Texas for an aggregate sales price of approximately $\n16.0\nmillion, an average of approximately $\n721\nper acre.  Additionally, we recognized land sales revenue of $\n1.4\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to land exchanges where we had no cost basis in the land conveyed.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold\n21,986\nacres of land in Texas for an aggregate sales price of approximately $\n113.0\nmillion, an average of approximately $\n5,141\nper acre.  Additionally, we conveyed\n5,620\nacres of land in exchange for\n5,545\nacres of land.

Qualifying participants may receive a matching contribution based on the amount participants contribute to the plan up to\n6\n% of their qualifying compensation.  TPL contributed approximately $\n0.5\nmillion, $\n0.3\nmillion and $\n0.1\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nTPL has a noncontributory pension plan (the “Pension Plan”) available to all eligible employees who have completed\none year\nof continuous service with TPL during which they completed at least\n1,000\nhours of service.  The Pension Plan provides for a normal retirement benefit at age 65. Contributions to the Pension Plan reflect benefits accrued with respect to\nF-14\nparticipants’ services to date, as well as the amount actuarially determined to pay lifetime benefits to participants and their beneficiaries upon retirement.\nThe following table sets forth the Pension Plan’s changes in benefit obligation, changes in fair value of assets, and funded status as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 using a measurement date of December 31 (in thousands):\nThe projected Pension Plan benefit obligation as of December 31, 2020 was impacted by changes in assumptions used as of that date compared to assumptions used as of December 31, 2019.  These changes included a decrease in the discount rate from\n3.25\n% as of December 31, 2019 to\n2.75\n% as of December 31, 2020 and a change in the mortality improvement scale from the MP-2019 Table to the MP-2020 Table.  The effect of the assumption changes was an increase in the projected benefit obligation of $\n1.0\nmillion.\nAmounts recognized in the balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 consist of (in thousands):\nF-15\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss consist of the following as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nNet periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 include the following components (in thousands):\nService cost, a component of net periodic benefit cost, is reflected in our consolidated statements of income within salaries and related employee expenses.  The other components of net periodic benefit cost are included in other income, net on the consolidated statements of income.\nOther changes in Pension Plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nTPL reclassified less than $\n0.2\nmillion (net of income tax benefit of less than $\n0.1\nmillion) out of accumulated other comprehensive loss for net periodic benefit cost to other income, net for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nThe following table summarizes the projected benefit obligation in excess of Pension Plan assets and Pension Plan assets in excess of  accumulated benefit obligation as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nF-16\nThe following are weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and costs as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nThe expected return on Pension Plan assets assumption of\n7.0\n% was selected by TPL based on historical real rates of return for the current asset mix and an assumption with respect to future inflation. The rate was determined based on a long-term allocation of about two-thirds fixed income and one-third equity securities; historical real rates of return of about\n2.5\n% and\n8.5\n% for fixed income and equity securities, respectively; and assuming a long-term inflation rate of\n2.5\n%.\nThe Pension Plan has a formal investment policy statement. The Pension Plan’s investment objective is balanced income, with a moderate risk tolerance. This objective emphasizes current income through a\n30\n% to\n80\n% allocation to fixed income securities, complemented by a secondary consideration for capital appreciation through an equity allocation in the range of\n20\n% to\n60\n%. Diversification is achieved through investment in mutual funds and bonds. The asset allocation is reviewed annually with respect to the target allocations and rebalancing adjustments and/or target allocation changes are made as appropriate. Our current funding policy is to maintain the Pension Plan’s fully funded status on an ERISA minimum funding basis.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe fair value accounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs used in measuring fair value, as follows:\nLevel\n1 – Inputs are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Since inputs are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, Level 1 inputs require the least judgment.\nLevel\n2 – Inputs are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, or are observable either directly or indirectly. Inputs are obtained from various sources including financial institutions and brokers.\nLevel\n3 – Inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. The degree of judgment exercised by us in determining fair value is greatest for fair value measurements categorized in Level 3.\nF-17\nThe fair values of the Pension Plan assets by major asset category as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are as follows (in thousands):\nManagement intends to at least fund the minimum ERISA amount for 2021 and may make some discretionary contributions to the Pension Plan, the amounts of which have not yet been determined.\nThe following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid for the following ten-year period (in thousands):\n7.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax provision charged to operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows (in thousands):\nF-18\nWhile TPL was a trust, it was taxed as if it were a corporation.\nTotal income tax expense differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 to income before Federal income taxes as a result of the following (in thousands):\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (in thousands):\nTPL files a U. S. Federal income tax return. With few exceptions, TPL is no longer subject to U. S. Federal income tax examination by tax authorities for years before 2017.\n8.\nLease Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have recorded right-of-use assets of $\n2.5\nmillion and $\n3.1\nmillion, respectively, and lease liabilities for $\n2.8\nmillion and $\n3.4\nmillion, respectively, primarily related to operating leases in connection with our administrative offices located in Dallas and Midland, Texas.  The office lease agreements require monthly rent payments and expire in December 2025 and August 2022, respectively.  Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  Operating lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $\n0.7\nmillion.\nF-19\nFuture minimum lease payments were as follows as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nRent expense for these lease agreements amounted to approximately $\n0.8\nmillion, $\n0.7\nmillion and $\n0.2\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n9.\nCapital\nPrior to the Corporate Reorganization, Certificates of Proprietary Interest (“Certificates”) and Sub-shares were exchangeable in the ratio of one Certificate to 3,000 Sub-shares. No Certificates were exchanged for Sub-shares for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.  On January 11, 2021, the Sub-shares were converted into shares of common stock on a pro rata,\none\n-for-one basis.  See further discussion in Note 11, “Subsequent Events — Corporate Reorganization.”\nThe number of Certificates authorized for issuance at a given date is the number then outstanding plus one/three-thousandth of the number of Sub-shares then outstanding. The number of Sub-shares authorized for issuance at a given date is the number then outstanding plus three thousand times the number of Certificates then outstanding.\nDividends\nDuring 2020, we paid a cash dividend of $\n10.00\nper Sub-share in March 2020 and special dividends of $\n16.00\nper Sub-Share, consisting of $\n6.00\nper Sub-share in March 2020 and $\n10.00\nper Sub-share in December 2020.  During March 2019, we paid a cash dividend of $\n1.75\nper Sub-share and a special dividend of $\n4.25\nper Sub-share.\nRepurchases of Sub-shares\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, there were\nno\nSub-shares repurchased.  During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we purchased and retired\n6,258\nand\n59,185\nSub-shares, respectively.\n10.\nBusiness Segment Reporting\nDuring the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following segments: Land and Resource Management and Water Services and Operations. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of our strategies and objectives and provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses. We eliminate any inter-segment revenues and expenses upon consolidation.\nThe Land and Resource Management segment encompasses the business of managing our approximately\n880,000\nacres of land and our oil and gas royalty interests in West Texas.  The revenue streams of this segment consist primarily of royalties from oil and gas, revenues from easements and commercial leases and land and material sales.\nThe Water Services and Operations segment encompasses the business of providing full-service water offerings to operators in the Permian Basin.  The revenue streams of this segment consist of revenue generated from sales of sourced and treated water as well as revenue from royalties on water service-related activity.\nF-20\nSegment financial results were as follows (in thousands):\nThe following table presents total assets and property, plant and equipment, net by segment (in thousands):\n11.\nSubsequent Events\nWe evaluated events that occurred after the balance sheet date through the date these financial statements were issued, and the following events that met recognition or disclosure criteria were identified:\nF-21\nCorporate Reorganization\nAs previously announced on March 23, 2020, our Trustees approved a plan to reorganize the Trust from its current structure to a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware.\nOn January 11, 2021, TPL completed its Corporate Reorganization, officially changing its name from Texas Pacific Land Trust to Texas Pacific Land Corporation (“TPL Corporation”).  To implement the Corporate Reorganization, the Trust and TPL Corporation entered into agreements and undertook and caused to be undertaken a series of transactions to effect the transfer to TPL Corporation of all of the Trust’s assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including investments, property and employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to, at and after the Corporate Reorganization. The agreements entered into include a contribution agreement between the Trust and TPL Corporation.\nPrior to the market opening on January 11, 2021, the Trust distributed all of the shares of common stock, par value $\n0.01\n, of TPL Corporation (the “Common Stock”) to holders of Sub-shares, par value of $0.03-1/3, of the Trust, on a pro rata, one-for-one, basis in accordance with their interests in the Trust (the “Distribution”). As a result of the Distribution, TPL Corporation is now an independent public company and its Common Stock is listed under the symbol “TPL” on the New York Stock Exchange.\nThe Corporate Reorganization would have had the following effect on our consolidated financial statements had the Corporate Reorganization occurred as of December 31, 2020:\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nHad the Corporate Reorganization occurred as of December 31, 2020, the pro forma balance sheet would have reflected pro forma adjustments as follows:\n•\nCapital would be eliminated and replaced with Stockholders’ equity;\n•\nCertificates of Proprietary Interest, par value $\n100\neach, would be eliminated as\nnone\nwere outstanding as of December 31, 2020;\n•\n7,756,156\noutstanding Sub-share Certificates of Proprietary Interest, par value $0.03-1/3, would be converted to\n7,756,156\noutstanding shares of Common Stock, $\n0.01\npar value; and\n•\nNet proceeds from all sources would be replaced with Retained Earnings.\nStatements of Income and Total Comprehensive Income\nHad the Corporate Reorganization occurred on January 1, 2020, the pro forma statements of income and total comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have reflected pro forma adjustments as follows:\n•\nAny costs associated with Corporate Reorganization are direct costs and would be expensed.  As such, there would be no related adjustment to the Statement of Income and Total Comprehensive Income; and\n•\nNet income per Sub-share Certificate - basic and diluted would be eliminated and replaced with Net income per share - basic and diluted.  The per share amount would not have been impacted.\nDividend Declared\nOn February 17, 2021, the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\n2.75\nper share payable on March 15, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 8, 2021.\n12.\nOil and Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited)\nWe measure the our share of oil and gas produced in barrels of equivalency (“BOEs”).  One BOE equals one barrel of crude oil, condensate, NGLs (natural gas liquids) or approximately 6,000 cubic feet of gas.  As of December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our share of oil and gas produced was approximately\n16.2\n,\n13.7\nand\n8.8\nthousand BOEs per day, respectively. Reserves related to our royalty interests are not presented because the information is unavailable.\nThere are a number of oil and gas wells that have been drilled but are not yet completed (“DUC”) where we have a royalty interest.  The number of DUC wells are determined using uniform drilling spacing units with pooled interests for all\nF-22\nwells awaiting completion.  We have identified\n531\n,\n486\nand\n362\nDUC wells subject to our royalty interest as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n13.\nSelected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)\nThe following tables present unaudited financial data of TPL for each quarter of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n*****\nF-23"
