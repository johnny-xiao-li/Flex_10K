    "text": "General\nFounded in 1967 by Mr. Ralph Lauren, we are a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, fragrances and hospitality. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across an expanding number of products, brands, sales channels, and international markets. We believe that our global reach, breadth of product offerings, and multi-channel distribution are unique among luxury and apparel companies.\nWe diversify our business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail, wholesale, and licensing). This allows us to maintain a dynamic balance as our operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or channel of distribution. We sell directly to consumers through our integrated retail channel, which includes our retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. Our wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which we have licensed the right to operate in defined geographic territories using our trademarks. In addition, we license to third parties for specified periods the right to access our various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.\nWe organize our business into the following three reportable segments: North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to these reportable segments, we also have other non-reportable segments. See \"\nOur Segments\n\" for further discussion of our segment reporting structure.\nOur global reach is extensive, as we sell directly to customers throughout the world via our 548 retail stores and 650 concession-based shop-within-shops, as well as through our own digital commerce sites and those of various third-party digital partners. Merchandise is also available through our wholesale distribution channels at approximately 9,000 doors worldwide, the majority in specialty stores, as well as through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers. In addition to our directly-operated stores and shops, our international licensing partners operate 139 Ralph Lauren stores and shops, and 143 Club Monaco stores and shops. As discussed in\n\"Recent Developments,\"\non May 13, 2021, we announced the anticipated sale of our Club Monaco business, which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2022.\nWe have been controlled by the Lauren family since the founding of our Company. As of March 27, 2021, Mr. R. Lauren, or entities controlled by the Lauren family, held approximately 84% of the voting power of the Company's outstanding common stock.\nObjectives and Opportunities\nWe believe that our size and the global scope of our operations provide us with design, sourcing, and distribution synergies across our different businesses. Our core strengths include a portfolio of global premium lifestyle brands, a well-diversified global multi-channel distribution network, an investment philosophy supported by a strong balance sheet, and an experienced management team. Despite the various risks and uncertainties associated with the current global economic environment, as discussed further in Item 7 — \"\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Global Economic Conditions and Industry Trends,\n\" we believe our core strengths will allow us to execute our long-term growth strategy.\nAn overview of our long-term growth strategy is presented below:\nGlobal Citizenship and Sustainability\nGlobal citizenship and sustainability at Ralph Lauren Corporation is rooted in the heritage of our brand and our purpose to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style. We believe that delivering the next 50 years for Ralph Lauren means rethinking our impact on the environment and society and utilizing creativity, the power of design, and innovative technologies to drive meaningful change. We call our citizenship and sustainability plan \"Design the Change,\" and through this strategy, we’re creating a more sustainable future in three key areas:\n1.\nCreate Timeless Style\n•\nResponsible Design\n— We commit to embedding sustainability, inclusivity, intention, and celebration into the products and services we design.\n•\nCircularity\n— We are committed to a comprehensive circular strategy, whereby we will inform our product development and support more circular systems in our industry by designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems.\n•\nSustainable Materials\n— We commit to using more materials in a way that results in positive social and environmental outcomes, protects biodiversity, advances animal welfare, and continuously improves traceability of our raw materials.\n•\nSustainable Spaces\n— We are committed to designing and building Ralph Lauren stores with materials that minimize environmental impact and maximize occupant health.\n•\nChemical Management\n— We commit to monitor and reduce hazardous chemical use and discharge and we are working to eliminate all hazardous chemicals from our product manufacturing.\n2.\nProtect the Environment\n•\nCarbon and Energy\n— We are committed to playing our part to address the climate crisis by reducing greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain and investing in credible emission removals.\n•\nWater Stewardship\n— We commit to reducing water consumption across our value chain and to safeguarding and preserving water resources in our communities.\n•\nWaste Management\n— We commit to integrating zero-waste principles across our business, focusing on reducing waste at its source and diverting waste from landfill through increased recycling and upcycling.\n•\nSustainable Packaging\n— We commit to our packaging material being recyclable, reusable, or sustainably sourced.\n3.\nChampion Better Lives\n•\nDiversity and Inclusion\n— We unite and inspire the communities within our Company, as well as those we serve, by amplifying voices and perspectives to create a culture of belonging, equality, inclusion, and fairness for all.\n•\nCommunity Engagement and Philanthropy\n— We commit to making a meaningful difference in our communities through our global employee volunteerism and our dedication to social and environmental causes.\n•\nWorker Empowerment and Well-being\n— We are committed to conducting our global operations ethically and with respect for the dignity of all people who make our products. We aim to enrich the quality of work and life for everyone in our supply chain, ensuring they all have the opportunity to reach their full potential in a safe and inclusive environment.\nAdditional information relating to Design the Change can be found in our annual sustainability reports, which is available at our website at http://investor.ralphlauren.com under the caption \"Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report.\" Our 2021 Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report is expected to be published in June 2021. The content of our sustainability reports is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus commonly referred to as COVID-19 emerged and spread rapidly across the globe, including throughout all major geographies in which we operate (North America, Europe, and Asia), resulting in adverse economic conditions and business disruptions, as well as significant volatility in global financial markets. Governments worldwide have imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as temporary travel bans, forced business closures, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. Such factors, among others, have resulted in a significant decline in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items. Additionally, during this period of uncertainty, companies across a wide array of industries have implemented various initiatives to reduce operating expenses and preserve cash balances, including work furloughs, reduced pay, and severance actions, which could lower consumers' disposable income levels or willingness to purchase discretionary items. Further, even after such government restrictions and company initiatives are lifted, consumer behavior, spending levels, and/or shopping preferences, such as willingness to congregate in indoor shopping centers or other populated locations, could be adversely affected.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced varying degrees of business disruptions and periods of closure of our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities, as have our wholesale customers, licensing partners, suppliers, and vendors. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2021, the majority of our stores in key markets were closed for an average of 8 to 10 weeks due to government-mandated lockdowns and other restrictions, resulting in significant adverse impacts to our operating results. Resurgences in certain parts of the world resulted in further business disruptions periodically throughout Fiscal 2021, most notably in Europe where a significant number of our stores were closed for approximately two to three months during the second half of Fiscal 2021, including during the holiday period, due to government-mandated lockdowns and other restrictions. Such disruptions have continued into the first quarter of Fiscal 2022, impacting not only our businesses in Europe but also in other regions of the world (notably our retail operations in Japan and our sourcing operations in India). Further, the majority of our stores that are able to remain open have periodically been subject to limited operating hours and/or customer capacity levels in accordance with local health guidelines, with traffic remaining challenged. Our wholesale and licensing businesses have also been adversely affected, particularly in North America and Europe, as a result of store closures and lower traffic and consumer demand.\nThroughout the pandemic, our priority has been to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees, customers, and the communities in which we operate around the world. We continue to consider the guidance of local governments and global health organizations and have implemented new health and safety protocols in our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities. We have also taken various preemptive actions to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position, including:\n•\namending our Global Credit Facility in May 2020 to temporarily waive our leverage ratio requirement (see Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements);\n•\nissuing $1.250 billion of unsecured senior notes in June 2020, the proceeds of which are being used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of certain of our previously outstanding borrowings (see Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements);\n•\ntemporarily suspending our quarterly cash dividend and common stock repurchase program, effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 (see Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements);\n•\ntemporarily reducing the base compensation of our executives and senior management team, as well as our Board of Directors, for the first quarter of Fiscal 2021;\n•\nfurloughing or reducing work hours for a significant portion of our employees during the first half of Fiscal 2021;\n•\ncarefully managing our expense structure across all key areas of spend, including aligning inventory levels with anticipated demand, negotiating rent abatements with certain of our landlords, and postponing non-critical capital build-out and other investments and activities;\n•\npursuing relevant government subsidy programs related to COVID-19 business disruptions; and\n•\nimproving upon our cash conversion cycle largely driven by our accounts receivable collection efforts and extended vendor payment terms.\nDespite the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, the pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve. Accordingly, we cannot predict for how long and to what extent the pandemic will impact our business operations or the global economy as a whole. We will continue to assess our operations location-by-location, considering the guidance of local governments and global health organizations to determine when our operations can begin returning to normal levels of business. See Item 1A — \"\nRisk Factors\n—\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\n—\nInfectious disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business\n\"\nfor additional discussion regarding risks to our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan\nWe have begun efforts to realign our resources to support future growth and profitability, and to create a sustainable cost structure. The key areas of our evaluation include our: (i) team organizational structures and ways of working; (ii) real estate footprint and related costs across corporate offices, distribution centers, and direct-to-consumer retail and wholesale doors; and (iii) brand portfolio.\nIn connection with the first initiative, on September 17, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the \"Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan\") to reduce our global workforce by the end of Fiscal 2021. Additionally, during our preliminary review of our store portfolio during the second quarter of Fiscal 2021, we made the decision to close our Polo store on Regent Street in London.\nOn October 29, 2020, we announced the planned transition of our Chaps brand to a fully licensed business model, consistent with our long-term brand elevation strategy in connection with our third initiative (see \"\nTransition of Chaps Brand to a Licensing Model\"\nfurther below for additional discussion).\nAdditionally, on February 3, 2021, our Board of Directors approved additional realignment actions related to our real estate initiative. Specifically, we plan to further rightsize and consolidate our global corporate offices to better align with our current organizational profile and new ways of working. We also expect to close certain of our stores to improve overall profitability. Additionally, we plan to complete the consolidation of our existing North America distribution centers in order to drive greater efficiencies, improve sustainability, and deliver a better consumer experience.\nFinally, on May 13, 2021, in connection with our brand portfolio initiative, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to sell our Club Monaco business to Regent, L.P., a global private equity firm. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2022.\nIn connection with these collective realignment initiatives, we expect to incur total estimated pre-tax charges of approximately $300 million to $350 million, of which $236.8 million was recorded during Fiscal 2021. Once substantially completed by the end of Fiscal 2022, these actions are expected to result in gross annualized pre-tax expense savings of approximately $200 million to $240 million, a portion of which will be reinvested back into the business. These estimated charges and expense savings are subject to change based upon the completion of the sale of our Club Monaco business.\nSee Note 9 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Restructuring Plan.\nTransition of Chaps Brand to a Fully Licensed Business Model\nOn October 29, 2020, we announced the planned transition of our Chaps brand to a fully licensed business model, consistent with our long-term brand elevation strategy. Specifically, we have entered into a multi-year licensing partnership, taking effect on August 1, 2021 after a transition period, with an affiliate of 5 Star Apparel LLC, a division of the OVED Group, to manufacture, market, and distribute Chaps menswear and womenswear. The products will be sold at existing channels of distribution with opportunities for expansion into additional channels and markets globally.\nThis agreement is expected to create incremental value for the Company by enabling an even greater focus on elevating our core brands in the marketplace, reducing our direct exposure to the North America department store channel, and setting up Chaps to deliver on its potential with an experienced partner that is focused on nurturing the brand.\nFiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan\nOn June 4, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan associated with our strategic objective of operating with discipline to drive sustainable growth (the \"Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan\"). The Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan included the following activities: (i) rightsizing and consolidation of our global distribution network and corporate offices; (ii) targeted severance-related actions; and (iii) closure of certain of our stores and shop-within-shops. Actions associated with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan resulted in gross annualized expense savings of approximately $80 million.\nIn connection with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan, we have recorded cumulative charges of $145.8 million since its inception, of which $48.5 million and $97.3 million were recorded during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. Actions associated with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan are complete and no additional charges are expected to be incurred in connection with this plan.\nSee Note 9 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan.\nOur Brands and Products\nOur products, which include apparel, footwear, accessories, and fragrance collections for men and women, as well as childrenswear and home furnishings, together with our hospitality portfolio, comprise one of the most widely recognized families of consumer brands.

While investing in digital commerce operations remains a primary focus, it is an extension of our investment in the integrated omni-channel strategy used to operate our overall retail business, in which our digital commerce operations are interdependent with our physical stores.\nOur Club Monaco digital commerce sites offer our domestic and Canadian customers access to our global assortment of Club Monaco apparel, footwear, and accessories product lines, as well as select online exclusives.\nOur Wholesale Business\nOur wholesale business sells our products globally to leading upscale and certain mid-tier department stores, specialty stores, and golf and pro shops, as well as to various third-party digital partners. We have continued to focus on elevating our brand by improving in-store product assortment and presentation, as well as full-price sell-throughs to consumers. As of the end of Fiscal 2021, our wholesale products were sold through approximately 9,000 doors worldwide, with the majority in specialty stores. Our products are also increasingly being sold through the digital commerce sites of many of our traditional wholesale customers and our third-party digital partners.\nThe primary product offerings sold through our wholesale channels of distribution include apparel, footwear, accessories, and home furnishings. Our luxury brands, including Ralph Lauren Collection and Ralph Lauren Purple Label, are distributed worldwide through a limited number of premier fashion retailers. In North America, our wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, and to a lesser extent, specialty stores. In Europe, our wholesale business is comprised of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country, as well as to various third-party digital partners. In Asia, our wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, with related products distributed through shop-within-shops. We also distribute our wholesale products to certain licensed stores operated by our partners in Latin America, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.\nWe sell the majority of our excess and out-of-season products through secondary distribution channels worldwide, including our retail factory stores.\nWorldwide Wholesale Distribution Channels\nThe following table presents by segment the number of wholesale doors in our primary channels of distribution as of March 27, 2021:\nIn addition to our conventional wholesale doors, our products are increasingly being sold through the websites of many of our traditional wholesale customers, as well as those of our third-party digital partners. As of March 27, 2021, our wholesale business served approximately 100 third-party digital partners, primarily in Europe.\nWe have three key wholesale customers that generate significant sales volume. During Fiscal 2021, sales to our three largest wholesale customers accounted for approximately 14% of our total net revenues. Substantially all sales to our three largest wholesale customers related to our North America segment.\nOur products are sold primarily by our own sales forces. Our wholesale business maintains its primary showrooms in New York City, as well as regional showrooms in London, Madrid, Milan, Munich, Paris, and Stockholm. In addition, we recently introduced virtual showrooms, allowing our customers to experience and discover our product assortments in a retail setting remotely.\nShop-within-Shops.\nAs a critical element of our distribution to department stores, we and our licensing partners utilize shop-within-shops to enhance brand recognition, to permit more complete merchandising of our lines by the department stores, and to differentiate the presentation of our products.\nThe following table presents by segment the number of shop-within-shops in our primary channels of distribution as of March 27, 2021:\nThe size of our shop-within-shops ranges from approximately 85 to 9,200 square feet. Shop-within-shop fixed assets primarily include items such as customized freestanding fixtures, wall cases and components, decorative items, and flooring. We normally share in the cost of building out these shop-within-shops with our wholesale customers.\nReplenishment Program.\nCore products such as knit shirts, chino pants, oxford cloth shirts, select footwear and accessories, and home products can be ordered by our wholesale customers at any time through our replenishment program. We generally ship these products within two to five days of order receipt.\nBacklog.\nWe generally receive wholesale orders approximately three to five months prior to the time the products are delivered to customers, with the exception of orders received through our replenishment program, which ship within two to five days of order receipt. Our wholesale orders are generally subject to broad cancellation rights. Further, the size of our order backlog depends upon a number of factors, including the timing of the market weeks for our particular lines during which a significant percentage of our orders are received and the timing of shipments, which varies from year-to-year with consideration for holidays, consumer trends, concept plans, and the replenishment program's usage. Consequently, the dollar amount of our backlog as of any date may not be indicative of actual future shipments and therefore is not meaningful in understanding our business taken as a whole.\nOur Licensing Business\nThrough licensing alliances, we combine our consumer insight, design, and marketing skills with the specific product or geographic competencies of our licensing partners to create and build new businesses. We generally seek out licensing partners who are leaders in their respective markets, contribute the majority of product development costs, provide the operational infrastructure required to support the business, and own the inventory. Our licensing business has been aggregated with other non-reportable segments.\nProduct Licensing\nWe grant our product licensees the right to access our various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings. Each product licensing partner pays us royalties based upon its sales of our products, generally subject to a minimum royalty requirement for the right to use our trademarks and design services. In addition, our licensing partners may be required to allocate a portion of their revenues to advertising our products and sharing in the creative costs associated with these products. Larger allocations typically are required in connection with launches of new products or in new territories. Our license agreements generally have two to five-year terms and may grant the licensees conditional renewal options.\nWe work closely with all of our licensing partners to ensure that their products are developed, marketed, and distributed to reach the intended consumer and are presented consistently across product categories to convey the distinctive identity and lifestyle associated with our brands. Virtually all aspects of the design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising, and promotion of Ralph Lauren products are subject to our prior approval and continuing oversight. We perform a broader range of services for most of our Ralph Lauren Home licensing partners than we do for our other licensing partners, including design, operating showrooms, marketing, and advertising.\nThe following table lists our largest licensing agreements as of March 27, 2021 for the product categories presented. Except as noted in the table, these product licenses cover North America only.\nAdditionally, on October 29, 2020, we announced the planned transition of our Chaps brand to a fully licensed business model, consistent with our long-term brand elevation strategy. Specifically, we have entered into a multi-year licensing partnership, taking effect on August 1, 2021 after a transition period, with an affiliate of 5 Star Apparel LLC, a division of the OVED Group, to manufacture, market, and distribute Chaps menswear and womenswear. See\n\"Recent Developments\"\nfor additional discussion.\nInternational Licensing\nOur international licensing partners acquire the right to sell, promote, market, and/or distribute various categories of our products in a given geographic area and source products from us, our product licensing partners, and independent sources. International licensees' rights may include the right to own and operate retail stores. As of March 27, 2021, our international licensing partners operated 139 Ralph Lauren stores and shops, and 143 Club Monaco stores and shops. As discussed in\n\"Recent Developments,\"\non May 13, 2021, we announced the anticipated sale of our Club Monaco business, which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2022.\nDigital Ecosystem\nInvesting in our digital ecosystem remains a primary focus and is a key component of our integrated global omni-channel strategy that spans across owned and partnered channels, both physical and digital. Our digital ecosystem is comprised of directly-operated platforms, wholesale partner websites, third-party digital pure players, and social commerce.\nOur directly-operated digital commerce sites represent our digital flagships, featuring the most elevated expression of our brands. The strategy for our digital flagships is to deliver distinct and immersive brand experiences, continuously enhance consumer experience, and develop digital content that drives deeper consumer engagement and conversion. With the ongoing launch of our localized sites, including in Japan and Hong Kong this year, we continue to expand the reach of our digital flagship experience. We also brought our physical flagships to life in a digital format this year with the launch of our virtual store experience, allowing consumers to experience our brands and product assortments in a way that was previously only possible by walking into our stores. In connection with our long-term growth strategy, we are also working to broaden our omni-channel service offerings, such as Buy Online-Ship to Store and Buy Online-Pick Up in Store.\nOur products are also sold through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers across the globe. With all partners in our ecosystem, we seek to showcase the brand consistently with our values. We collaborate with our key wholesale customers to deliver the right content to the right audience, and leverage consumer insights to develop a holistic, channel-agnostic view of our consumer.\nWe also sell our products online through various third-party digital pure-play sites to reach younger consumers and amplify our brand messages. On many of these sites, we have created digital shop-in-shop environments with a consistent brand experience, tailored product stories, and an assortment that is carefully curated by our merchants. We also partner closely with our pure-play customers on marketing content and events, as well as optimizing search and other data analyses to drive higher traffic and conversion for our brands. We also continue to tap into the social commerce opportunity, such as our launch of Instagram Checkout this year.\nIn connection with our digital commerce operations, we engage consumers through various digital and social media platforms, which are supported through our collaboration with influencers who have an authentic connection to our brand.\nSeasonality of Business\nOur business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of retail sales in our second and third fiscal quarters and higher wholesale sales in our second and fourth fiscal quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping periods impacting our retail business and timing of seasonal wholesale shipments. As a result of changes in our business, consumer spending patterns, and the macroeconomic environment, including those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events, historical quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition, fluctuations in sales, operating income, and cash flows in any fiscal quarter may be affected by other events affecting retail sales, such as changes in weather patterns.\nWorking capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital requirements typically increase during the first half of the fiscal year as inventory builds to support peak shipping/selling periods and, accordingly, typically decrease during the second half of the fiscal year as inventory is shipped/sold. Cash provided by operating activities is typically higher in the second half of the fiscal year due to reduced working capital requirements during that period.\nProduct Design\nOur products reflect a timeless and innovative interpretation of American style with a strong international appeal. Our consistent emphasis on new and distinctive design has been an important contributor to the prominence, strength, and reputation of the Ralph Lauren brands.\nOur Ralph Lauren products are designed by, and under the direction of, Mr. Ralph Lauren and our design staff. We form design teams around our brands and product categories to develop concepts, themes, and products for each brand and category. Through close collaboration with merchandising, sales, and product management staff, these teams support all of our businesses in order to gain market information and other valuable input.\nMarketing and Advertising\nOur marketing and advertising programs communicate the themes and images of our brands and are integral to the success of our product offerings. The majority of our advertising programs are created and executed by our in-house creative and advertising agency to ensure consistency of presentation, which is complemented by our marketing experts in each region who help to execute our international strategies.\nWe create distinctive image advertising for our brands, conveying the particular message of each one within the context of the overall Ralph Lauren aesthetic. Advertisements generally portray a lifestyle rather than a specific item and include a variety of products offered by us and, in some cases, our licensing partners. Our communication campaigns are increasingly being executed through digital and social media platforms to drive further engagement with the younger consumer. With regard to influencers, we believe in fostering long-term relationships with those who have an authentic connection to our brand and influence the areas of culture that matter most to our audiences. We also continue to advertise through print and outdoor media, and, to a lesser extent, through television and cinema.\nOur digital advertising programs focus on high impact and innovative digital media outlets, which allow us to convey our key brand messages and lifestyle positioning. We also develop digital editorial initiatives that allow for deeper education and engagement around the Ralph Lauren lifestyle. We deploy these marketing and advertising initiatives through online, mobile, video, email, and social media. Our digital commerce sites present the Ralph Lauren lifestyle online, while offering a broad array of our apparel, footwear, accessories, and home product lines.\nAdditionally, we advertise in consumer and trade publications, and participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with some of our retail and licensing partners. We have outdoor advertising placements in key cities as well, focusing on impact and reach. We also provide point-of-sale fixtures and signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the presentation of our products at their retail locations. In addition, when our licensing partners are required to spend an amount equal to a percentage of their licensed product sales on advertising, in certain cases we coordinate the advertising placement on their behalf. We believe our investments in shop-within-shop environments and retail stores, including our global flagship locations, contribute to and enhance the themes of our brands to consumers.\nWe also conduct a variety of public relations activities. For example, we typically introduce each of our spring and fall menswear and womenswear collections at press presentations in major cities such as New York City and Milan. Such fashion events, in addition to celebrity red carpet dressing moments and events hosted in our stores and restaurants, including The\nPolo Bar\nin New York City, generate extensive domestic and international media and social coverage.\nWe continue to be the official outfitter for all on-court officials at both the Wimbledon and the U.S. Open tennis tournaments. Both tournaments provide worldwide exposure for our brand in a relevant lifestyle environment. We also continue to be the exclusive Official Parade Outfitter for the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Teams, with the right to manufacture, distribute, advertise, promote, and sell products in the U.S. which replicate the Parade Outfits and associated leisure wear. We will be dressing the team for the upcoming Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan in July and August 2021. As part of our involvement with Team U.S.A., we have established a partnership with athletes serving as brand ambassadors and as the faces of our advertising, marketing, and public relations campaigns. We are also the official apparel outfitter for the Professional Golfers' Association (\"PGA\") of America, the PGA Championship, the U.S. Golf Association, and the U.S. Ryder Cup Team, as well as a partner of the American Junior Golf Association. We sponsor a roster of professional golfers, including Billy Horschel, Davis Love III, Doc Redman, Nick Watney, and Tom Watson.\nWe believe our partnerships with such prestigious global athletic events reinforce our brand's sporting heritage in a truly authentic way and serve to connect our Company and brands to our consumers through their individual areas of passion.\nSourcing, Production and Quality\nWe contract for the manufacture of our products and do not own or operate any production facilities. Over 300 different manufacturers worldwide produce our apparel, footwear, accessories, and home products, with no one manufacturer providing more than 6% of our total production during Fiscal 2021. We source both finished products and raw materials. Raw materials include fabric, buttons, and other trim. Finished products consist of manufactured and fully assembled products ready for shipment to our customers. In Fiscal 2021, approximately 97% of our products (by dollar value) were produced outside of the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, with approximately 20% of our products sourced from China and another 20% from Vietnam. See \"\nImport Restrictions and Other Government Regulations,\n\" Item 1A — \"\nRisk Factors\n—\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions — Economic conditions could have a negative impact on our major customers, suppliers, vendors, and lenders, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business,\"\nand Item 1A — \"\nRisk Factors\n—\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations — Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our specifications\n.\"\nMost of our businesses must commit to the manufacturing of our garments before we sell finished goods, whether to wholly-owned retail stores or to wholesale customers. We also must commit to the purchase of fabric from mills well in advance of our sales. If we overestimate our primary customers' demand for a particular product or the need for a particular fabric or yarn, we primarily sell the excess products or garments made from such fabric or yarn in our factory stores or through other secondary distribution channels.\nSuppliers operate under the close supervision of our global manufacturing division and buying agents headquartered in Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe. All products are produced according to our specifications and standards. Production and quality control staff in Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe monitor manufacturing at supplier facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the final product. Procedures have been implemented under our vendor certification and compliance programs so that quality assurance is reviewed early in the production process, allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption.\nCompetition\nCompetition is very strong in the segments of the fashion and consumer product industries in which we operate. We compete with numerous designers and manufacturers of apparel, footwear, accessories, fragrances, and home furnishing products, both domestic and international. We also face increasing competition from companies selling our product categories through the Internet. Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than us. We compete primarily on the basis of fashion, quality, value, and service, which depend on our ability to:\n•\nanticipate and respond to changing consumer demands and shopping preferences, including the ever-increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communications, and online shopping;\n•\ncreate and maintain favorable brand recognition, loyalty, and reputation for quality;\n•\ndevelop and produce innovative, high-quality products that appeal to consumers of varying age groups;\n•\ncompetitively price our products and create an acceptable value proposition for consumers;\n•\nprovide strong and effective marketing support;\n•\nprovide attractive, reliable, secure, and user-friendly digital commerce sites;\n•\nobtain sufficient retail floor space, and effectively present our products to consumers;\n•\nattract consumer traffic to stores, shop-within-shops, and digital commerce sites;\n•\nsource raw materials at cost-effective prices;\n•\nanticipate and maintain proper inventory levels;\n•\nensure product availability and optimize supply chain and distribution efficiencies;\n•\nmaintain and grow market share;\n•\nrecruit and retain key employees;\n•\nprotect our intellectual property; and\n•\nwithstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions.\nSee Item 1A — \"\nRisk Factors\n—\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations — We face intense competition worldwide in the markets in which we operate\n.\"\nDistribution\nTo facilitate global distribution, our products are shipped from manufacturers to a network of distribution centers around the world for inspection, sorting, packing, and delivery to our retail locations and digital commerce and wholesale customers. This network includes the following primary distribution facilities:\n(a)\nIncludes Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Macau, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.\nAll facilities are designed to allow for high-density cube storage and value-added services, and utilize unit and carton tracking technology to facilitate process control and inventory management. The distribution network is managed through globally integrated information technology systems.\nInformation Systems\nOur information systems facilitate business processes, consumer experiences, and decision-making support across the Company and our extended ecosystem of manufacturers, vendors, business partners, and customers. Our system applications are connected to support the flow of information across functions, including:\n•\nproduct design, sourcing, and production;\n•\ncomprehensive order processing, fulfillment, and distribution;\n•\nretail store and digital commerce operations;\n•\nmarketing and advertising;\n•\nfinancial accounting and management reporting; and\n•\nhuman resources.\nOur retail operation systems, including point-of-sale registers and merchandising, planning, and inventory management systems, support operational processes within our store network and link with our digital commerce processes to support omni-channel capabilities.\nWe are continually improving and upgrading our computer systems and software. For example, during Fiscal 2021, we began upgrading our value chain processes and technology to support advanced global capabilities for our supply and demand management solutions. In Fiscal 2021, we also migrated our analytics platform to the cloud to accelerate our advanced analytics capabilities across functions. We are also continually enhancing the consumer experience by adding new functionality to our direct-to-consumer channels.\nWe have a longstanding information security risk program committed to regular risk management practices surrounding the protection of confidential data. This program includes various technical controls, including security monitoring, data leakage protection, network segmentation and access controls around the computer resources that house confidential or sensitive data. We have also implemented employee awareness training programs around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks. We continually evaluate the security environment surrounding the handling and control of our critical data, especially the private data we receive from our customers, employees and partners, and have instituted additional measures to help protect us from system intrusion or data breaches. Additionally, we have purchased network security and cyber liability insurance in order to provide a level of financial protection, should a data breach occur.\nSee Item 1A — \"\nRisk Factors\n—\nRisks Related to Information Systems and Data Security\n—\nA data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to litigation risk, and adversely affect our business\n\" and \"\nRisk Factors\n—\nRisks Related to Information Systems and Data Security\n—\nOur business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively\n.\"\nWholesale Credit Control\nWe manage our own credit function. We sell our merchandise principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners, and extend credit based on an evaluation of the wholesale customer's financial capacity and condition, usually without requiring collateral. We monitor credit levels and the financial condition of our wholesale customers on a continuing basis to minimize credit risk. We do not factor or underwrite our accounts receivables, nor do we maintain credit insurance to manage the risk of bad debts. In North America, collection and deduction transactional activities are provided through a third-party service provider. See Item 1A — \"\nRisk Factors\n—\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations\n—\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a limited number of large wholesale customers. Our business could be\nadversely affected as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings, other ownership changes in the retail industry, and/or any financial instability of our large wholesale customers\n.\"\nTrademarks\nWe own the RALPH LAUREN, POLO, POLO RALPH LAUREN, and the famous Polo Player Design trademarks in the U.S. and over 120 countries worldwide. Other trademarks that we own include:\n•\nPURPLE LABEL;\n•\nDOUBLE RL;\n•\nRRL & DESIGN;\n•\nRLX;\n•\nLAUREN RALPH LAUREN;\n•\nPINK PONY;\n•\nLAUREN;\n•\nRALPH;\n•\nPOLO BEAR;\n•\nCHAPS;\n•\nCLUB MONACO; and\n•\nVarious other trademarks.\nMr. Ralph Lauren has the royalty-free right to use as trademarks RALPH LAUREN, DOUBLE RL, and RRL in perpetuity in connection with, among other things, beef and living animals. The trademarks DOUBLE RL and RRL are currently used by the Double RL Company, an entity wholly owned by Mr. R. Lauren. In addition, Mr. R. Lauren has the right to engage in personal projects involving film or theatrical productions (not including or relating to our business) through RRL Productions, Inc., a company wholly owned by Mr. R. Lauren. Any activity by these companies has no impact on us.\nOur trademarks are the subject of registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items of apparel, apparel-related products and accessories, home furnishings, restaurant and café services, online services and online publications, and beauty products, as well as in connection with retail services, and we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks are used in connection with the related products and services and the required registration renewals are filed. We regard the license to use the trademarks and our other proprietary rights in and to the trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and, on a worldwide basis, vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. As a result of the appeal of our trademarks, our products have been the object of counterfeiting. While we have a broad enforcement program which has been generally effective in protecting our intellectual property rights and limiting the sale of counterfeit products in the U.S. and in most major markets abroad, we face greater challenges with respect to enforcing our rights against trademark infringement in certain parts of Asia.\nIn markets outside of the U.S., our rights to some or all of our trademarks may not be clearly established. Over the course of our international expansion, we have experienced conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks, including POLO and/or a representation of a Polo Player Design, which impede our use and registration of our principal trademarks. While such conflicts are common and may arise again from time to time as we continue our international expansion, we have, in general, successfully resolved such conflicts in the past through both legal action and negotiated settlements with third-party owners of the conflicting marks (see Item 1A — \"\nRisk Factors\n—\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations\n—\nOur trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside the U.S.\n\" and Item 3 — \"\nLegal Proceedings\n\" for further discussion). Although we have not suffered any material restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce trademarks to new markets.\nImport Restrictions and Other Government Regulations\nVirtually all of our merchandise imported into the Americas, Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand is subject to duties. In addition, most of the countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas and duties to protect their local industries from import surges that threaten to create market disruption. The U.S. and other countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported (from China or other countries) at unfairly traded prices in such increased quantities that would cause (or threaten) injury to the relevant domestic industry (generally known as \"anti-dumping\" actions). If dumping is suspected in the U.S., the U.S. government may self-initiate a dumping case on behalf of the U.S. textile industry which could significantly affect our costs. Furthermore, additional duties, generally known as countervailing duties, can also be imposed by the U.S. government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a U.S. industry.\nIn addition, each of the countries in which our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports. Because the U.S. and the other countries in which our products are manufactured and sold may, from time to time, impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import controls or restrictions, or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates or levels, we maintain a program of intensive monitoring of import restrictions and opportunities. We seek to minimize our potential exposure to import-related risks through, among other measures, adjustments in product design and fabrication, shifts of production among countries and manufacturers, and through geographical diversification of our sources of supply.\nAs almost all of our products are manufactured by foreign suppliers, the enactment of new legislation or the administration of current international trade regulations or executive action affecting textile agreements, or changes in sourcing patterns could adversely affect our operations. See Item 1A — \"\nRisk Factors\n—\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, and Tax Matters\n—\nOur ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks\n\"\nand\n\"\nRisk Factors\n—\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations\n—\nOur business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our specifications.\n\"\nWe are also subject to other international trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, now known as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement and other special trade preference programs. A portion of our imported products are eligible for certain of these duty-advantaged programs.\nApparel and other products sold by us are under the jurisdiction of multiple governmental agencies, including, in the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. Our products are also subject to regulation in the U.S. and other countries, including the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which relate principally to product labeling, licensing requirements, and consumer product safety requirements and regulatory testing, particularly with respect to products used by children. Any failure to comply with such requirements could result in significant penalties and require us to recall products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these regulations, as well as applicable federal, state, local, and foreign rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment. We do not anticipate making any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the next fiscal year or in the near future. Our licensed products, licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, and the vendors and factories with which we contract for the manufacture and distribution of our products are also subject to regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, vendors, and factories to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and we are not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.\nWe are also subject to disclosure and reporting requirements, established under existing or new federal or state laws, such as the requirements to identify the origin and existence of certain \"conflict minerals\" under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and disclosures of specific actions to eradicate abusive labor practices in our supply chain under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. While we require our suppliers to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and our operating guidelines which promote ethical and socially responsible business practices, any violation of labor, environmental, health, and safety or other laws, or any divergence by an independent supplier's labor practices from generally accepted industry standards, could damage our reputation, disrupt our sourcing capabilities, and increase the cost of doing business, adversely affecting our results of operations. See Item 1A — \"\nRisk Factors\n—\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations\n—\nOur business could suffer if we fail to comply with labor laws or if one of our manufacturers fails to use acceptable labor or environmental practices.\n\"\nAlthough we have not suffered any material restriction from doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional trademarks to new markets.\nHuman Capital\nOur purpose is to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style. This purpose extends to how we provide resources to support our employees' health, well-being, work-life harmony, and quality of life. We believe that attracting, developing, and retaining a diverse work force that is both skilled and motivated is critical to the successful execution of our long-term growth strategy. To this end, we are committed to creating a culture and work environment in which all employees feel welcome and can thrive, both as individuals and as part of our team.\nOur Board of Directors regularly reviews our people and development strategy, including our employee diversity, respect, and inclusion initiatives.\nOur Employees\nAs of March 27, 2021, we had approximately 20,300 employees, comprised of approximately 12,100 full-time and 8,200 part-time employees. Approximately 10,400 of our employees are located in the U.S. and 9,900 are located in foreign countries. Approximately 5 of our U.S. production employees in the womenswear business are members of Workers United (which was previously known as UNITE HERE) under an industry association collective bargaining agreement, which our womenswear subsidiary has adopted. We consider our relations with both our union and non-union employees to be good.\nAs of March 27, 2021, approximately 64% and 36% of our global workforce self-identified as female and male, respectively, and in the U.S., approximately 39% of our workforce self-identified as white and 60% self-identified as an underrepresented race and ethnic group.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe believe the diversity of our employees and our culture of inclusivity drive innovation and creativity, and we are committed to further strengthening such diversity and inclusion across race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and mental health and wellness, among other demographics, ensuring fairness for all. Our diversity and inclusion (\"D&I\") strategy is guided by the following five pillars:\n1.\nTalent\n— Cultivate diverse teams and elevate underrepresented talent to leadership ranks. In calendar 2019, we achieved our goal to have gender parity in our leadership ranks for Vice President and above. We are committed to have at least 20% of People of Color in our global leadership team by calendar 2023.\n2.\nCollaboration and Belonging\n— Enable open dialogue and create safe spaces for the amplification of diverse voices and perspectives. During Fiscal 2021, we implemented six new internal advisory councils, as discussed below, and employee resource groups. We expanded our RL Community Groups to include a Working Parents Network, focusing on our employees who are parents and caregivers. We also established a company manifesto with specific and action-oriented commitments to elevate, amplify, and support the Black Community.\n3.\nLearning\n— Build an inclusive culture through awareness, education, and deployment of mandatory D&I trainings globally. During Fiscal 2021, we expanded inclusive leadership learning with the rollout of an unconscious bias, allyship, and advocacy training, which is also now included in our new hire onboarding. In addition, we have mentoring and professional development programs offering internal and external development and career acceleration programs for underrepresented talent. We also provided scholarship funds to academic programs supporting underrepresented students.\n4.\nCommunication and Messaging\n— Maximize our inclusive message and increase the transparency of our D&I initiatives. We gather direct feedback from our employees and measure their engagement to better understand how we can improve. In Fiscal 2021, we expanded our approach to solicit employee feedback, shifting from an annual company-wide survey to more frequent pulse surveys on topical issues, specifically focusing on the experiences of our underrepresented employees. For Fiscal 2022, we plan to return to our global annual employee survey.\n5.\nCelebration and Recognition\n— Appreciate our unique differences and increase educational events for all employees with a focus on diverse experiences. In Fiscal 2021, we increased educational and celebratory events focused on diverse experiences with over 30 virtual D&I events with 10,000 participants globally. Our D&I efforts have been recognized in recent years, including being named a Best Place to Work for LGTBQIA+, receiving 100% on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index in calendar 2021 for the second year in a row, as well as being named Best Place to Advance for Women by Parity.Org.\nDuring Fiscal 2021, we expanded our Global D&I Steering Committee whose members are directly accountable for executing on our D&I strategies ensuring consistent support to achieve our goals. This committee leads our newly created D&I Black and African American Commitment Working Groups, which provide a robust structural framework to action on our racial equity commitments. We also introduced advisory councils, including the Black Advisory Council, Asian Pacific Islander Council, Native American Council, and Hispanic, Latino, and Latinx Council, who advise our executive leadership team, marketing campaigns, and long-term programs and initiatives to amplify the voices of underrepresented groups at Ralph Lauren.\nIn addition to our robust D&I governance structure, our employees play a key role in embedding a culture of inclusion at Ralph Lauren through our other employee resource groups, including our Gender Community Group, Pride Group, and Disability, Mental Health, and Wellness Group. These groups promote dialogue, define D&I focus areas, and help us properly prioritize action plans and necessary resources to develop solutions.\nAdditional information relating to our D&I initiatives and goals can be found in our annual sustainability reports, which is available at our website at http://investor.ralphlauren.com under the caption \"Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report.\"  Our 2021 Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report is expected to be published in June 2021. The content of our sustainability reports is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.\nLearning and Development\nWe are committed to the growth and development of our employees and offer a wide range of training programs for all levels. In addition to receiving ongoing on-the-job training and coaching, our employees can build skills and prepare for the future through our Ralph Lauren Learning Portal. We added new courses this year, many of which focus on remote working skills, as well as D&I education. We also support learning beyond our walls through tuition assistance. These collective learning and development programs help foster career mobility for our employees, while simultaneously allowing us to fill open positions with existing employees who know our company best.\nEmployee Safety and Well-Being\nWe are committed to the safety, health, and overall well-being of each of our employees and their families, providing a wide array of physical, emotional, social, and financial support to meet this objective. THRIVE, our global wellness program, provides access to benefits such as flexible work arrangements, volunteer events, and physical and mental wellness support. We gather direct feedback from our workforce, including through regular employee surveys, which allows us to measure their engagement and understand how we can improve.\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our priority has been to ensure the safety and well-being of all of our employees, customers, and the communities in which we operate in around the world. In this regard, we have implemented new health and safety protocols in our stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices. We have also expanded employee well-being services in the U.S. to include additional backup childcare, as well as MyStrength, an online wellness portal. Globally, we host monthly wellness webinars and provide weekly meditation classes through our RL Well-Being Exchange program. Financial grants have also been provided through the Ralph Lauren Employee Relief Fund for employees facing special circumstances.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe are committed to providing competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain a diverse and talented workforce. We are also committed to achieving pay equity throughout our organization, conducting biennial assessments with the assistance of an independent human capital management firm to analyze our employee compensation based on gender, race, and ethnicity. We offer a wide array of both employer-paid and employee-paid benefits to support our employees' overall financial, physical, and mental well-being, including, but not limited to, healthcare and welfare benefits, retirement savings, paid time off, temporary leave, sabbaticals, and flexible work arrangements. We also provide our employees a merchandise\ndiscount on most of our products. During Fiscal 2021, we expanded our medical benefits in the U.S. to our part-time employees, ensuring equitable benefits for our front-line employees. As a token of gratitude for their work during the COVID-19 pandemic, we also recently provided a one-time $1,000 bonus to each of our global frontline workers in May 2021. Additionally, we made COVID-19 vaccines available in our North Carolina Health Clinic with over 400 employees receiving their first dose from an onsite counselor.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe following are our current executive officers and their principal recent business experience:"

    "text": "There are risks associated with an investment in our securities. The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risk factors could materially adversely affect our business, including our prospects, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, the trading price of our securities, and/or the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business in future periods or if circumstances change.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nInfectious disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business could be adversely affected by infectious disease outbreaks, such as the novel strain of coronavirus commonly referred to as COVID-19. COVID-19, which emerged beginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020, has spread rapidly across the globe, including throughout all major geographies in which we operate (North America, Europe, and Asia), resulting in adverse economic conditions and business disruptions, as well as significant volatility in global financial markets. Governments worldwide have periodically imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as temporary travel bans, stay-at-home orders, and forced business closures or other operational restrictions, including reduced capacity limits and operating hours, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. Such factors, among others, have resulted in a significant decline in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced varying degrees of business disruptions and periods of closure of our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities, as have our wholesale customers, licensing partners, suppliers, and vendors, as described in Item 1 —\n\"Business — Recent Developments.\"\nCollectively, these disruptions have had a material adverse impact on our business throughout Fiscal 2021. Despite the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, the pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve. Accordingly, we cannot predict for how long and to what extent this crisis will continue to impact our business operations or the global economy as a whole. Potential impacts to our business include, but are not limited to:\n•\nour ability to successfully execute our long-term growth strategy;\n•\nreduced retail traffic at our stores and those of our wholesale customers and licensing partners due to forced closures or other operational restrictions, such as reduced capacity limits and operating hours, declines in tourism, and/or potential changes in consumer behavior and shopping preferences, such as their willingness to congregate in shopping centers or other populated locations;\n•\npotential declines in the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products, caused by higher unemployment and lower disposal income levels, travel and social gathering restrictions, work-from-home arrangements, or other factors beyond our control;\n•\nthe potential build-up of excess inventory as a result of store closures and/or lower consumer demand;\n•\nour ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support our operations, including repayment of our debt obligations as they become due, as well as to return value to our shareholders in the form of dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock;\n•\nthe potential loss of one or more of our significant wholesale customers or licensing partners, or the loss of a large number of smaller wholesale customers or licensing partners, if they are not able to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions, and our ability to collect outstanding receivables;\n•\ntemporary closures or other operational restrictions of our distribution centers and/or corporate facilities;\n•\nsupply chain disruptions resulting from closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials, and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas, including any related cost increases;\n•\nour ability to access capital markets and maintain compliance with covenants associated with our existing debt instruments, as well as the ability of our key customers, suppliers, and vendors to do the same with regard to their own obligations;\n•\nour ability to successfully negotiate with landlords to obtain rent abatements, rent deferrals, and other relief;\n•\nadditional costs to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, and communities, such as more frequent and thorough cleanings of our facilities and supplying personal protection equipment;\n•\ndiversion of management attention and resources from ongoing business activities and/or a decrease in employee morale; and\n•\nour ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nAdditional discussion related to the various risks and uncertainties described above is included elsewhere within this \"Risk Factors\" section of our Form 10-K.\nEconomic, political, and other conditions may adversely affect the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products.\nThe industries in which we operate are cyclical. Many economic and other factors outside of our control affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel, footwear, accessory, and home product industries, including, among others, man-made or natural disasters, including pandemic diseases such as COVID-19; consumer perceptions of personal well-being and safety; consumer perceptions of current and future economic conditions; employment levels and wage rates; stock market performance; inflation; interest rates; foreign currency exchange rates; the housing market; consumer debt levels; the availability of consumer credit; commodity prices, including fuel and energy costs; taxation; general domestic and international political conditions; the threat, outbreak, or escalation of terrorism, military conflicts, or other hostilities; and weather conditions.\nConsumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products, tend to decline during recessionary periods and at other times when disposable income is lower. Unfavorable economic conditions and other factors, such as pandemic diseases and other health-related concerns, political unrest, war, and acts of terrorism, may also reduce consumers' willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores and shop-within-shops are located. Further, consumers may prefer to spend more of their discretionary income on \"experiences,\" such as dining and entertainment, over consumer goods. Stay-at-home orders, social gathering restrictions, and work-from-home arrangements, such as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, may also diminish consumers’ demand for luxury apparel products. Accordingly, a downturn or an uncertain outlook in the economies in which we, or our wholesale customers and licensing partners, sell our products, or other changes in consumer preferences, may materially adversely affect our business.\nEconomic conditions could have a negative impact on our major customers, suppliers, vendors, and lenders, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business.\nAlthough we believe that our existing cash and investments, cash provided by operations, and available borrowing capacity under our credit and overdraft facilities and commercial paper borrowing program will provide us with sufficient liquidity, the impact of economic conditions on our major customers, suppliers, vendors, and lenders, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and their ability to access global capital markets cannot be predicted. The inability of major manufacturers to ship our products could impair our ability to meet the delivery date requirements of our customers. Deterioration in global financial or capital markets could affect our ability to access sources of liquidity to provide for our future cash needs, increase the cost of any future financing, or cause our lenders to be unable to meet their funding commitments under our credit and overdraft facilities. A disruption in the ability of our significant customers to access liquidity\ncould cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses which could lead to a significant reduction in their future orders of our products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations.\nOur business is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. Specifically, changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies impact our financial results from a transactional perspective, as our foreign operations generally purchase inventory in U.S. dollars, as is common for most apparel companies. Given that we source most of our products overseas, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies. Changes in currency exchange rates may also impact consumers' willingness or ability to travel abroad and/or purchase our products while traveling, as well as affect the U.S. Dollar value of the foreign currency denominated prices at which our international businesses sell products. Additionally, the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as their financial results are translated from the respective local currency into U.S. Dollars during the financial statement consolidation process. The foreign currencies to which we are exposed to from a transactional and translational perspective primarily include the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi. The expansion of our international business increases our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk.\nAlthough we hedge certain exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising in the ordinary course of business, we cannot fully anticipate all of our currency exposures and therefore foreign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging activities include the volatility of currency markets, the accuracy of forecasted transactions, and the availability of hedging instruments. As such, our hedging activities may not completely mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations. See Item 7 —\n\"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Market Risk Management.\"\nRisks Related to our Strategic Initiatives and Restructuring Activities\nWe cannot assure the successful implementation of our growth strategy.\nWe have developed a long-term growth strategy with the objective of delivering sustainable, profitable growth and long-term value creation for shareholders, as described in Item 1 —\n\"Business — Objectives and Opportunities.\"\nOur ability to successfully execute our growth strategy is subject to various risks and uncertainties, as described herein.\nAlthough we believe that our growth strategy will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, there can be no assurance regarding the timing of or extent to which we will realize the anticipated benefits, if at all. Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute the various elements of our growth strategy, changes in consumer preferences, competition, economic conditions, and other risks described herein, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Such a failure could also result in the implementation of additional restructuring-related activities beyond those currently planned, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term.\nAchievement of our growth strategy may require investment in new capabilities, distribution channels, and technologies. These investments may result in short-term costs without accompanying current revenues and, therefore, may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term. There can be no assurance regarding the timing of or extent to which we will realize the anticipated benefits of these investments and other costs, if at all.\nWe may not be successful in the expansion of our multi-channel distribution network or accelerating growth in certain product categories.\nImplementation of our growth strategy involves the continuation and expansion of our multi-channel distribution network, including within international markets such as China, which is subject to many factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n•\nidentify new or underpenetrated markets where our products and brand will be accepted by consumers;\n•\nattract customers, particularly in new markets;\n•\nidentify desirable freestanding and department store locations, the availability of which may be out of our control;\n•\nnegotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired tenant improvement allowances;\n•\nefficiently and cost effectively build-out stores and shop-within-shops;\n•\nsource sufficient inventory levels to meet the needs of the new stores and shop-within-shops;\n•\nhire, train, and retain competent store personnel; and\n•\nintegrate new stores and shop-within-shops into our existing systems and operations.\nAny of these challenges could delay or otherwise prevent us from successfully executing our distribution expansion strategy. There can be no assurance that our new stores and shop-within-shops will be successful and profitable or if the capital costs associated with the build-out of such new locations will be recovered. Further, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new or existing competitors that have a more established market presence than us or other competitive advantages. Other risks related to our international expansion plans include general economic conditions in specific countries and markets, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships and any resulting anti-American sentiment, political instability, and foreign government regulation, among other risks described herein. If our expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe success of our business also depends largely on our ability to continue to maintain, enhance, and expand our digital footprint and capabilities. In recent years, consumers have been increasingly shopping online using computers, smartphones, tablets, and other devices. The COVID-19 pandemic has further amplified this trend due in part to travel bans, stay-at-home orders, forced business closures, and other operational restrictions, which impede upon the ease at which consumers can shop at brick and mortar locations. Many consumers may also prefer to avoid populated locations, such as indoor shopping centers, in fear of exposing themselves to the virus or other infectious diseases. Any failure on our part, or on the part of our third-party digital partners, to provide attractive, reliable, secure, and user-friendly digital commerce platforms, including mobile apps, could negatively impact our customers' shopping experience resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty to our brands, and lost sales. In addition, as we continue to expand and increase the global presence of our digital commerce business, sales from our brick and mortar stores and wholesale channels of distribution in areas where digital commerce sites are introduced may decline due to changes in consumer shopping habits and cannibalization.\nOur growth strategy also includes accelerating growth in certain high-value, underdeveloped product categories, comprised of denim, wear to work, outerwear, footwear, and accessories. We compete with other retailers in these product categories, some of which may be significantly larger than us and more established in these product categories, and competition is intense, as described within other risk factors herein. There can be no assurance that our targeted expansion in these product categories will be successful.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to respond to constantly changing fashion and retail trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner, develop products that resonate with our existing customers and attract new customers, and provide a seamless shopping experience to our customers.\nThe industries in which we operate have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. Our success depends in large part on our ability to originate and define fashion product and home product trends, as well as to anticipate, gauge, and react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner. Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers worldwide whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change, influenced by fashion trends, economic conditions, and weather conditions, among other factors. This issue is further compounded by the increasing use of digital and social media by consumers and the speed by which information and opinions are shared across the globe. We cannot assure that we will be able to continue to develop appealing styles or successfully meet constantly changing consumer preferences in the future. In addition, we cannot assure that any new products or brands that we introduce will be successfully received by consumers. Any failure on our part to anticipate, identify, and respond effectively to changing consumer preferences and fashion trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our products and leave us with a substantial amount of unsold inventory or missed opportunities. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business. For a discussion of risks related to our inventory management, see\n\"Risks Related to our Strategic Initiatives and Restructuring Activities — Our profitability may decline if we are unable to effectively manage inventory or as a result of increasing pressure on margins.\"\nOur marketing and advertising programs are integral to the success of our product offerings and on our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers. Our communication campaigns are increasingly being executed through digital and social media platforms to drive further engagement with the younger consumer, with a focus on influencers. However, we cannot assure that our marketing and advertising programs will be successful or appeal to consumers.\nThe success of our business also depends on our ability to continue to develop and maintain a reliable omni-channel experience for our customers, as well as our ability to introduce new Connected Retail capabilities, such as virtual clienteling, Buy Online-Ship to Store, Buy Online-Pick Up in Store, curbside pickup, appointment scheduling, and mobile checkout. Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to a shopping experience through multiple technologies, including computers, smartphones, tablets, and other devices, as our customers have become increasingly technologically savvy. We are increasingly using digital and social media platforms to interact with customers and enhance their shopping experience. If we are unable to develop and continuously improve our customer-facing technologies, we may not be able to provide a convenient and consistent experience to our customers regardless of the sales channel. This could negatively affect our ability to compete with other retailers and result in diminished loyalty to our brands, which could adversely impact our business.\nWe have also implemented, and expect to continue to implement, new store design concepts as part of our growth strategy. There can be no assurance that any of our store designs will resonate with customers or otherwise achieve the desired sales and profitability measures necessary to recover our initial capital investments. If customers are not receptive to the design layout or visual merchandising of our stores, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, the failure of our store designs to achieve acceptable results could lead to our decision to close a store prior to the lease expiration date. For additional discussion of risks related to the early termination of our leases, see\n\"Risks Related to our Business and Operations\n—\nOur business is subject to risks associated with leasing real estate and other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases.\"\nOur profitability may decline if we are unable to effectively manage inventory or as a result of increasing pressure on margins.\nWe have implemented key strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and improve the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply chain. Although we have shortened lead times for the design, sourcing, and production of certain of our product lines, we expect to continue to place orders with our vendors for the majority of products in advance of the related selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences and demand and pricing shifts. Our failure to continue to shorten lead times or to correctly anticipate consumer preferences and demand could result in the build-up of excess inventory. Other factors beyond our control could also result in the build-up of excess inventory, including unforeseen adverse economic conditions or business disruptions, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Excess inventory levels could result in the utilization of less-preferred distribution channels, markdowns, promotional sales, donations, or destruction to dispose of such excess or slow-moving inventory, which may negatively impact our overall profitability and/or impair the image of our brands. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which may negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty, and result in lost sales. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAdditionally, our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition and a highly promotional retail environment, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, and changes in consumer spending patterns. Although we continue to limit our promotional activity in connection with our quality of sales initiatives, these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our costs. If our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability will decline. In addition, changes in our customer, channel, and geographic sales mix could have a negative impact on our profitability. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from our restructuring plans.\nWe have implemented restructuring plans to support key strategic initiatives, such as the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan, as described in Item 1 —\n\"Business — Recent Developments.\"\nAlthough designed to deliver long-term sustainable growth, restructuring plans present significant potential risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating enhancements and/or cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, including:\n•\nhigher than anticipated costs in implementing planned workforce reductions, particularly in highly regulated locations outside the U.S.;\n•\nhigher than anticipated lease termination and store or facility closure costs (see\n\"Risks Related to our Business and Operations\n—\nOur business is subject to risks associated with leasing real estate and other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases\"\n);\n•\nfailure to meet operational targets or customer requirements due to the loss of employees or inadequate transfer of knowledge;\n•\nfailure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing, and subsequent to completing, our restructuring plans;\n•\ndiversion of management attention and resources from ongoing business activities and/or a decrease in employee morale;\n•\nattrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce; and\n•\ndamage to our reputation and brand image due to our restructuring-related activities, including the closure of certain of our stores.\nIf we are not successful in implementing and managing our restructuring plans, we may not be able to achieve targeted operating enhancements, sales growth, and/or cost reductions, which could adversely impact our business. Our failure to achieve targeted results for any reason, including business disruptions from pandemic diseases such as COVID-19, could also lead to the implementation of additional restructuring-related activities, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term.\nRisks Related to our Business and Operations\nThe loss of the services of Mr. Ralph Lauren or any other changes to our executive and senior management team may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business.\nMr. Ralph Lauren's leadership in the design and marketing areas of our business has been a critical element of our success since the inception of our Company. Mr. R. Lauren is instrumental to, and closely identified with, our brand that bears his name. Our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage the goodwill associated with Mr. R. Lauren's name may be damaged if we were to lose his services. The death or disability of Mr. R. Lauren or other extended or permanent loss of his services, or any negative market or industry perception with respect to him or arising from his loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also depend on the service and management experience of other key executive officers and members of senior management who have substantial experience and expertise in our industry and our business and have made significant contributions to our growth and success. Competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by our reputation, our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, and economic conditions, among other factors. Any changes in our executive and senior management team, including those resulting from our restructuring actions, may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business and future strategic direction. The departure of any key individuals and the failure to ensure a smooth transition and effective transfer of knowledge involving senior employees could hinder or delay our strategic planning and execution, as well as adversely affect our ability to attract and retain other experienced and talented employees. Such departures could also impede our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are not protected by a material amount of key-man or similar life insurance covering our executive officers, including Mr. R. Lauren, or other members of senior management. We have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers, but competition for experienced executives in our industry is intense and the non-compete period with respect to certain of our executive officers could, in some circumstances in the event of their termination of employment with our Company, end prior to the employment term set forth in their employment agreements.\nWe face intense competition worldwide in the markets in which we operate.\nWe face increasing competition from companies selling apparel, footwear, accessories, home, and other of our product categories through the Internet. Although we sell our products through the Internet, increased competition and promotional activity in the worldwide apparel, footwear, accessory, and home product industries from Internet-based competitors could reduce our sales, prices, and margins. We also face intense competition from other domestic and foreign fashion-oriented apparel, footwear, accessory, and casual apparel producers that sell products through brick and mortar stores and wholesale and licensing channels. We compete with these companies primarily on the basis of:\n•\nanticipating and responding in a timely fashion to changing consumer demands and shopping preferences, including the ever-increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communications, and online shopping;\n•\ncreating and maintaining favorable brand recognition, loyalty, and a reputation for quality;\n•\ndeveloping and producing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups;\n•\ncompetitively pricing our products and creating an acceptable value proposition for consumers;\n•\nproviding strong and effective marketing support;\n•\nproviding attractive, reliable, secure, and user-friendly digital commerce sites;\n•\nobtaining sufficient retail floor space and effective presentation of our products at stores and shop-within-shops;\n•\nattracting consumer traffic to stores, shop-within-shops, and digital commerce sites;\n•\nsourcing raw materials at cost-effective prices;\n•\nanticipating and maintaining proper inventory levels;\n•\nensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain and distribution efficiencies with third-party manufacturers and retailers;\n•\nmaintaining and growing market share;\n•\nrecruiting and retaining key employees;\n•\nprotecting our intellectual property; and\n•\nability to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions.\nSome of our competitors may be significantly larger and more diversified and may have greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources, more desirable store locations, and/or greater digital commerce presence than us, among other competitive advantages. Such competitive advantages may enable them to better withstand unfavorable economic conditions, compete more effectively on the basis of price and production, and/or more quickly respond to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences than us. In addition, technological advances and the retail industry's low barriers to entry allow for the introduction of new competitors and products at a rapid pace. Any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors, could result in reduced market share or sales, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value and reputation of our brands.\nOur success depends on the value and reputation of our brands and our ability to consistently anticipate, identify, and respond to customers' demands, preferences, and fashion trends in the design, pricing, and production of our products, including the preference for certain products to be manufactured in the U.S. Any negative publicity regarding Mr. R. Lauren, or other members of our executive and senior management team, or our Company as a whole, especially through social media which accelerates and increases the potential scope of negative publicity, could negatively impact the image of our brands with our customers and result in diminished loyalty to our brands, even if the subject of such publicity is unverified or inaccurate and we seek to correct it. There is also increased focus from consumers, employees, investors, and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters. Although we have established certain long-term initiatives and goals regarding our impact on the environment and society as a whole, including our diversity and inclusion initiatives, there can be no assurance that our various stakeholders will agree with our initiatives or if we will be successful in achieving our goals. Our failure to comply with ethical, social, product safety, labor, health, environmental, privacy, or other standards and regulations could damage the reputation of our brands and lead to adverse consumer actions and/or investment decisions by investors, as well as expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. Even if we react appropriately to negative publicity, our customers' perception of our brand image and our reputation could be negatively impacted. Any failure on our part to retain the value and reputation of brands could adversely impact our business.\nOur trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside the U.S.\nWe believe that our trademarks, intellectual property, and other proprietary rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and anti-counterfeiting activities worldwide. However, significant counterfeiting and imitation of our products continue to exist. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect trademarks or other proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. and, as a result, our intellectual property may be more vulnerable and difficult to protect in such countries. Over the course of our international expansion, we have experienced conflicts with various third parties that have acquired or\nclaimed ownership rights to some of our key trademarks that include Polo and/or a representation of a polo player astride a horse, or otherwise have contested our rights to our trademarks. We have resolved certain of these conflicts through both legal action and negotiated settlements. We cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent counterfeiting, lost business, or brand dilution, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to challenge brands arising from imitation of our products. Also, there can be no assurance that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction or at all. See Item 1 —\n\"Business — Trademarks,\" and Item 3 — \"Legal Proceedings.\"\nOur business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our specifications.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of our products. Our products are manufactured to our specifications through arrangements with over 300 foreign manufacturers in various countries. In Fiscal 2021, approximately 97% of our products (by dollar value) were produced outside of the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, with approximately 20% of our products sourced from China and another 20% from Vietnam. Risks inherent in importing our products include:\n•\npandemic diseases, such as COVID-19, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials, port congestion, and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;\n•\nchanges in social, political, and economic conditions or terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which our manufacturers or suppliers are located;\n•\nthe imposition of additional regulations, quotas, or safeguards relating to imports or exports, and costs of complying with such regulations and other laws relating to the identification and reporting of the sources of raw materials used in our products;\n•\nthe imposition of additional duties, tariffs, taxes, and other charges on imports or exports;\n•\nunfavorable changes in the availability, cost, or quality of raw materials and commodities;\n•\nincreases in the cost of labor, travel, and transportation;\n•\ndisruptions of shipping and international trade caused by natural and man-made disasters, labor shortages (stemming from labor disputes, strikes, or otherwise), or other unforeseen events;\n•\nheightened terrorism-related cargo and supply chain security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent, or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in the delivery of cargo;\n•\ndecreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures, and damage to the reputation of our brands; and\n•\nthe imposition of sanctions in the form of additional duties either by the U.S. or its trading partners to remedy perceived illegal actions by national governments.\nIn addition, the inability of a manufacturer to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our strict quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items, which could result in cancellation of orders, refusal to accept deliveries, or a substantial reduction in purchase prices. Prices of raw materials used to manufacture our products may also fluctuate significantly as a result of many factors, including general economic conditions, energy prices, crop yields, and availability of labor and the related costs of such labor. Any increases in prices of such raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales. Furthermore, the cost of labor at many of our third-party manufacturers has been increasing significantly and, as the middle class in developing countries such as China continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate. The cost of transportation remains significant as well, and it is likely that such cost will fluctuate significantly if oil prices remain volatile. We may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials, freight, or labor costs through pricing actions or other means.\nAny one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business. For a discussion of risks related to the potential imposition of additional regulations and laws, see\n\"Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, and Tax Matters\n—\nOur ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks.\"\nOur business could suffer if we need to replace manufacturers or distribution centers.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend exclusively on independent third parties for the manufacture of our products. We compete with other companies for the production capacity of our manufacturers. Some of these competitors may place larger orders than we do, and thus may have an advantage in securing production capacity. If we experience a significant increase in demand, or if an existing manufacturer of ours must be replaced, we may have to expand our third-party manufacturing capacity. We cannot guarantee that this additional capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us. See Item 1 —\n\"Business — Sourcing, Production and Quality.\"\nWe enter into purchase order commitments each season specifying a time for delivery, method of payment, design and quality specifications, and other standard industry provisions, but do not have long-term contracts with any manufacturer. None of the manufacturers we use produce our products exclusively.\nIn addition, we rely on a number of owned, leased, and independently-operated distribution facilities around the world to warehouse and ship products to our customers and perform other related logistic services. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers depends on the proper operation of these distribution centers. Our distributions centers generally utilize computer-controlled and automated equipment, which are subject to various risks, including software viruses, security breaches, power interruptions, or other system failures. If any of our distribution centers were to close or become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, including pandemic diseases such as COVID-19, or if we fail to successfully consolidate existing facilities or transition to new facilities, we could experience a substantial loss of inventory, disruption of deliveries to our customers and our stores, increased costs, and longer lead times associated with the distribution of products during the period that would be required to reopen or replace the facility. Any such disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also rely upon third-party transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments, including shipments to and from our distribution centers, to our stores and shop-within-shops, and to our digital commerce and wholesale customers. Our utilization of these shipping services is subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, potential labor shortages (stemming from labor disputes, strikes, or otherwise), severe weather, and pandemic diseases, which could delay the timing of shipments, and increases in wages and fuel prices, which could result in higher transportation costs. Any delays in the timing of our product shipments or increases in transportation costs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with leasing real estate and other assets under long-term, non-cancellable leases.\nWe generally operate most of our stores and corporate facilities under long-term, non-cancellable leasing arrangements. Our retail store leases typically require us to make minimum rental payments, and often contingent rental payments based upon sales. In addition, our leases generally require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance, and utilities. We generally cannot cancel our leases at our option. If we decide to close a store, or if we decide to downsize, consolidate, or relocate any of our corporate facilities, we may be required to record an impairment charge and/or exit costs associated with the disposal of the store or corporate facility. In addition, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the remaining lease term, even after the space is exited or otherwise closed and even if such closures are beyond our control (such as the recent forced store closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic). Such costs and obligations related to the early or temporary closure of our stores or termination of our leases could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, as each of our leases naturally expires, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could lead to store closures resulting in lost sales.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a limited number of large wholesale customers. Our business could be adversely affected as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings, other ownership changes in the retail industry, and/or any financial instability of our large wholesale customers.\nSeveral of our department store customers, including some under common ownership, account for a significant portion of our wholesale net sales. A substantial portion of sales of our licensed products by our domestic licensing partners are also made to our largest department store customers. Sales to our three largest wholesale customers accounted for approximately 14% of total net revenues for Fiscal 2021, and these customers accounted for approximately 30% of our total gross trade accounts receivable outstanding as of March 27, 2021. Substantially all sales to our three largest wholesale customers related to our North America segment.\nWe typically do not enter into long-term agreements with our customers. Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our product lines every season. A decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by economic conditions, financial difficulties, competitive\nconditions, or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners or their new strategic and operational initiatives, including their continued focus on further development of their \"private label\" initiatives, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe department store sector has also experienced numerous consolidations, restructurings, reorganizations, and other ownership changes in recent years, which could potentially increase in frequency as a result of prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions, such as those being caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, or changes in consumer shopping preferences, such as the increasing shift away from traditional brick and mortar wholesale retailers to larger online retailers. Our wholesale customers have experienced significant business disruptions as a result of the pandemic, including declines in retail traffic, temporary store closures, and other operational restrictions. There can be no assurance that our wholesale customers have adequate financial resources and/or access to additional capital to withstand prolonged periods of such adverse economic conditions. The loss of one or more significant wholesale customers, or the loss of a large number of smaller wholesale customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurther, even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our large wholesale customers, particularly those located in the U.S., have been highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise, including our products. The continuation of such promotional activity could negatively impact our brand image and/or lead to requests from those customers for increased markdown allowances at the end of the season. In response and in connection with our growth plan, we strategically reduce shipments to certain of our customers and close less productive doors when deemed appropriate.\nWe sell our wholesale merchandise primarily to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, and extend credit based on an evaluation of each wholesale customer's financial condition, usually without requiring collateral. However, the financial difficulties of a wholesale customer, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could cause us to limit or eliminate our business with that customer. We may also assume more credit risk relating to that customer's receivables. Our inability to collect on our trade accounts receivable from any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. See Item 1 —\n\"Business — Wholesale Credit Control.\"\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could restrict our ability to engage in additional capital-related transactions in the future.\nAs of March 27, 2021, our consolidated indebtedness was approximately $1.633 billion, comprised of our outstanding borrowings under Senior Notes. We also maintain several credit and overdraft facilities, including our Global Credit Facility, which collectively had a remaining availability of approximately $571 million as of March 27, 2021. Accordingly, the amount of our indebtedness could further increase materially if we decide to draw upon our credit or overdraft facilities.\nWe rely on our operating cash flows to repay our outstanding borrowings, as well as to fund any working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend payments, share repurchases, and other general corporate purposes. Prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions in any of our key regions, or a combination thereof, such as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could impede our ability to pay our obligations as they become due or return value to our shareholders, as well as delay previously planned expenditures related to our operations. Credit rating agencies also periodically review our capital structure and our ability to generate earnings. A prolonged period of deteriorated financial performance or our inability to comply with debt covenants (as discussed below) could make future financing more difficult to secure and/or expensive. Further, factors beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions, could disrupt capital markets and limit the availability or willingness of financial institutions to extend capital to us in the future.\nCertain of our debt instruments contain a number of affirmative and negative covenants. On May 26, 2020, we entered into an amendment to our Global Credit Facility that relaxed certain financial covenants while providing additional restrictions under our negative covenants for a specified period of time as further described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our amended Global Credit Facility also contains representations and warranties, including that there has been no material adverse change in the business, operations, property, or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Our failure to comply with such covenants or representations and warranties, or otherwise secure temporary waivers of non-compliance, could result in the termination of the related facilities and/or our lenders demanding any amounts outstanding to be immediately repaid, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, even if we are able to obtain waivers of non-compliance, such waivers may result in incremental fees, higher interest rates, and/or additional restrictions and covenants.\nWe rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses. Failure to maintain licensing partners could harm our business.\nThe risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products in addition to any number of possible risks specific to a licensing partner's business, including risks associated with a particular licensing partner's ability to (i) obtain capital; (ii) execute its business plans; (iii) manage its labor relations; (iv) maintain relationships with its suppliers and customers; (v) generate sufficient cash flows to fund its operations and pay its obligations as they become due, including minimum royalties due to us; (vi) withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions, such as those being caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; and (vii) manage its credit and bankruptcy risks effectively.\nAlthough a number of our license agreements prohibit our licensing partners from entering into licensing arrangements with our competitors, our licensing partners generally are not precluded from offering, under other non-competitor brands, the types of products covered by their license agreements with us. A substantial portion of sales of our products by our domestic licensing partners are also made to our largest customers. While we have significant control over our licensing partners' products and advertising, we rely on our licensing partners for, among other things, operational and financial control over their businesses. Changes in management, reduced sales of licensed products, poor execution, or financial difficulties with respect to any of our licensing partners could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. Although we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners in most circumstances, if necessary, our inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced licensing revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. See Item 1 —\n\"Business — Our Licensing Business.\"\nOur business could be adversely affected by man-made or natural disasters and other catastrophic events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate.\nOur operations, including retail, distribution, and warehousing operations, are susceptible to man-made or natural disasters, including pandemic diseases such as COVID-19, severe weather, geological events, and other catastrophic events, such as terrorist attacks and military conflict, any of which could disrupt our operations. In addition, the operations of our customers and suppliers could experience similar disruptions. The occurrence of natural disasters or other catastrophic events may result in sudden disruptions in the business operations of the local economies affected, as well as of the regional and global economies. The occurrence of such events could also adversely affect financial markets and the availability of capital. In addition, our business can be affected by unseasonable weather conditions, such as extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures in the winter or unseasonably cold temperatures in the summer. Any of these events could result in decreased demand for our products and disruptions in our sales channels and manufacturing and distribution networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Information Systems and Data Security\nA data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to litigation risk, and adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the Internet, for a significant portion of our direct-to-consumer sales, including our digital commerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing. We are also responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of our digital commerce sites and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy. In our normal course of business, we often collect, transmit, and/or retain certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information. There is significant concern by consumers, employees, and lawmakers alike over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft, and user privacy, as cyber-criminals are becoming increasingly more sophisticated in their attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and confidential or sensitive data.\nDespite the security measures we currently have in place (including those described in Item 1 —\n\"Business — Information Systems\"\n), our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, phishing attacks, computer viruses, malware, ransomware, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other Internet or email events. The increased use of smartphones, tablets, and other wireless devices, as well as the need for a substantial portion of our corporate employees to work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, may also heighten these and other operational risks. The retail industry in particular continues to be the target of many cyber-attacks, which are becoming increasingly more difficult to anticipate and prevent due to their rapidly evolving nature. Although we have purchased network security and cyber liability insurance to provide a level of financial protection should a data breach occur,\nsuch insurance may not cover us against all claims or costs associated with such a breach. Additionally, the technology we use to protect our systems from being breached or compromised could become outdated as a result of advances in computer capabilities or other technological developments. Further, measures we implement to protect our computer systems against cyber-attacks may make them harder to use or reduce the speed at which they operate, which in turn could negatively impact our customers' shopping experience resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty to our brands, and lost sales.\nAny perceived or actual electronic or physical security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, including penetration of our network security, whether by us or by a third party, could disrupt our business, severely damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to risks of litigation, significant fines and penalties, and liability, and result in deterioration in our customers' and employees' confidence in us, and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Since we do not control third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future, any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our employees, customers, or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility, result in lost sales, impair our ability to attract website visitors, and/or reduce our ability to attract and retain employees and customers. As these threats develop and grow, we may find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and our infrastructure, including the implementation of new computer systems or upgrades to existing systems, deployment of additional personnel and protection-related technologies, engagement of third-party consultants, and training of employees.\nIn addition, the regulatory environment relating to information security and privacy is becoming increasingly more demanding with frequent new requirements surrounding the handling, protection, and use of personal and sensitive information. We may incur significant costs in complying with the various applicable state, federal, and foreign laws regarding protection of, and unauthorized disclosure of, personal information. Additionally, failing to comply with such laws and regulations could damage the reputation of our brands and lead to adverse consumer actions, as well as expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nOur business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively.\nWe are dependent on our computer systems to record and process transactions and manage and operate our business, including designing, marketing, manufacturing, importing, tracking, and distributing our products, processing payments, accounting for and reporting financial results, and managing our employees and employee benefit programs. In addition, we have digital commerce and other informational websites in North America, Europe, and Asia, including Australia and New Zealand, and have plans for additional digital commerce sites in the future. Given the complexity of our business and the significant number of transactions that we engage in on a daily basis, it is imperative that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our computer hardware and software systems.\nDespite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, computer viruses, technical malfunctions, inadequate system capacity, power outages, natural disasters, and usage errors by our employees or third-party consultants. If our information technology systems become damaged or otherwise cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to repair or replace them. Additionally, confidential or sensitive data related to our customers or employees could be lost or compromised. We are continually improving and upgrading our computer systems and software, which also involves risks and uncertainties. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, implementation, or transition of such systems could result in increased costs, disruptions in the sourcing, sale, and shipment of our product, delays in the collection of cash from our customers, and/or adversely affect our ability to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner. Any material disruptions in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, and Tax Matters\nOur ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks.\nOur ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain our current level of operations in our existing markets is subject to certain risks associated with operating in various locations around the globe. These include, but are not limited to:\n•\ncomplying with a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, trade, labor, product labeling, and product safety restrictions, as well as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining\nbusiness, and similar foreign country laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, which prohibits U.K. and related companies from any form of bribery;\n•\nadapting to local customs and culture;\n•\nunexpected changes in laws, judicial processes, or regulatory requirements;\n•\nthe imposition of additional duties, tariffs, taxes, and other charges or other barriers to trade;\n•\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships;\n•\ncivil and political instability, such as the recent protests in the U.S., and terrorist attacks;\n•\npandemic diseases, such as COVID-19; and\n•\ngeneral economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.\nChanges in regulatory, geopolitical, social, economic, or monetary policies and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business in the future or may require us to exit a particular market or significantly modify our current business practices. For example, in recent years both the U.S. and China have imposed new tariffs on each other related to the importation of certain product categories, including imports of apparel into the U.S. from China. As a result of actions to mitigate our exposure to the resulting tariffs, which have included diverting production to and sourcing from other countries, driving productivity within our existing supplier base, and taking pricing actions, the tariffs enacted to date have not had a material adverse impact on our business operations. However, if the U.S. decides to impose additional tariffs on apparel or other of our goods imported from China, there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset all related increased costs, which could be material to our business operations as approximately 20% of our products are sourced from China. We cannot predict if, and to what extent, there will be changes to international trade agreements or the resulting impact any such changes would have on our business operations, which could be material. For a discussion of risks associated with the importation of products, see\n\"Risks Related to our Business and Operations\n—\nOur business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our specifications.\"\nOur business could also be impacted by changes to the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the \"OECD\"), which represents a coalition of member countries, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits among affiliated entities located in different tax jurisdictions. In response, certain member countries are beginning to implement legislation to align their international tax rules with the OECD's recommendations, such as Switzerland’s recently enacted Swiss Tax Act, as described in Item 7 — \"\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Recent Developments.\"\nAdditionally, the Biden Administration has proposed to increase the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21% up to as much as 28%, as well as increase U.S. taxation on foreign earnings. Other taxing authorities of certain state, local, and other foreign jurisdictions may also decide to modify existing tax laws. We cannot predict which, if any, of these items or others will be enacted into law or the resulting impact any such enactment will have on our business operations, which could be material.\nAdditionally, the United Kingdom recently withdrew from the European Union, commonly referred to as \"Brexit,\" whereby it ceased to be a member effective January 31, 2020. In December 2020, the United Kingdom and the European Union entered into an agreement that defines their future relationship, including terms of trade, that among its provisions will result in new tariffs on goods imported to the United Kingdom from the European Union that were manufactured elsewhere, as well as require additional administrative effort to import and export goods, adding friction and cost to transportation. The United Kingdom's future relationship with the European Union could also adversely impact consumer and investor confidence, and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products. Although we are closely monitoring the latest Brexit developments, including the December 2020 trade agreement, and are assessing risks and opportunities and developing strategies to mitigate our exposure, Brexit and its resulting impacts to the economy could materially adversely affect our business.\nFluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results.\nWe are subject to income and non-income taxes in many U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, with the applicable tax rates varying by jurisdiction. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. At any given time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing authorities. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. Our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may also be materially impacted\nby changes in the mix and level of earnings by jurisdiction or by changes to existing accounting rules. Additionally, our products are subject to import and excise duties, and/or sales, consumption, value-added taxes (\"VAT\"), and other non-income taxes in certain international jurisdictions. Failure to correctly calculate or submit the appropriate amount of income or non-income taxes could subject us to substantial fines and penalties and adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate may change, or there may be changes in interpretation and enforcement of existing tax laws, which could materially affect our income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of risks related to the potential imposition of additional regulations and laws, see\n\"Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, and Tax Matters\n—\nOur ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks.\"\nOur business could suffer if we fail to comply with labor laws or if one of our manufacturers fails to use acceptable labor or environmental practices.\nWe are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, and citizenship requirements. Compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation.\nIn addition, we require our licensing partners and independent manufacturers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our employees periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers, we do not control these manufacturers or their labor practices. The violation of labor, environmental, or other laws by an independent manufacturer used by us or one of our licensing partners, or the divergence of an independent manufacturer's or licensing partner's labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the U.S., could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation. Any of these events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCertain legal proceedings, regulatory matters, and accounting changes could adversely affect our business.\nWe are involved in certain legal proceedings and regulatory matters and are subject from time to time to various claims involving alleged breach of contract claims, intellectual property and other related claims, escheatment and unclaimed property, credit card fraud, security breaches in certain of our retail store information systems, employment issues, consumer matters, and other litigation. Certain of these lawsuits and claims, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, could result in material liability to our Company or have a negative impact on our reputation or relations with our employees, customers, licensing partners, or other third parties. Other potential claimants may also be encouraged to bring suits against us based on a settlement from us or adverse court decision against us for similar claims or allegations as their own. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require our Company to devote substantial time and resources to defend itself. Further, changes in governmental regulations both in the U.S. and in other countries where we conduct business operations could have an adverse impact on our business. See Item 3 —\n\"Legal Proceedings\"\nfor further discussion of our Company's legal matters.\nIn addition, we are subject to changes in accounting rules and interpretations issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and other regulatory agencies. If and when effective, such changes to accounting standards could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain recently issued accounting standards.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe trading prices of our securities periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of predictions of our earnings or other financial performance, including our ability to return value to shareholders.\nOur business planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth, and profitability, and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of our Company and our stockholders. However, we also recognize that, from time to time, it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our quarterly and annual forecast of net sales and earnings. While we generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we do not have any responsibility to update any of our guidance or other forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. In addition, any longer-term guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable. However, such long-range targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and full fiscal year expectations. Additionally, external analysts and investors may publish their own independent predictions of our future performance. We do not endorse such predictions or assume any\nresponsibility to correct such predictions when they differ from our own expectations. If, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside analysts, or others, the market price of our securities could be adversely affected. Investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the prices of our securities.\nIn addition, we have historically returned value to shareholders through our payment of quarterly cash dividends and common stock share repurchases. Investors may have an expectation that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends, further increase our cash dividend rate, and/or repurchase shares available under our Class A common stock repurchase program. Our ability to pay quarterly cash dividends and repurchase our Class A common stock will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive, and other factors that are beyond our control, such as impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in us temporarily suspending our quarterly cash dividend and share repurchases, effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021. Further, our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, elect to suspend or otherwise alter these programs at any time. The market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend payments and/or Class A common stock share repurchase activity differ from investors' expectations.\nThe voting shares of our Company's stock are concentrated in one majority stockholder.\nAs of March 27, 2021, Mr. Ralph Lauren, or entities controlled by the Lauren family, held approximately 84% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock of our Company. In addition, Mr. R. Lauren serves as our Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, Mr. R. Lauren's son, Mr. David Lauren, serves as our Chief Innovation Officer, Strategic Advisor to the CEO, and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, and we employ other members of the Lauren family. From time to time, we may have other business dealings with Mr. R. Lauren, members of the Lauren family, or entities affiliated with Mr. R. Lauren or the Lauren family. As a result of his stock ownership and position in our Company, Mr. R. Lauren has the ability to exercise significant control over our business, including, without limitation, (i) the election of our Class B common stock directors, voting separately as a class and (ii) any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and the approval of mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets."

    "text": "The following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (\"MD&A\") should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We utilize a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday immediately before or after March 31. As such, Fiscal 2021 ended on March 27, 2021 and was a 52-week period; Fiscal 2020 ended on March 28, 2020 and was a 52-week period; Fiscal 2019 ended on March 30, 2019 and was a 52-week period; and Fiscal 2022 will end on April 2, 2022 and will be a 53-week period.\nINTRODUCTION\nMD&A is provided as a supplement to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto to help provide an understanding of our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. MD&A is organized as follows:\n•\nOverview.\nThis section provides a general description of our business, global economic conditions and industry trends, and a summary of our financial performance for Fiscal 2021. In addition, this section includes a discussion of recent developments and transactions affecting comparability that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition, and in anticipating future trends.\n•\nResults of operations.\nThis section provides an analysis of our results of operations for Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 as compared to the respective prior fiscal year.\n•\nFinancial condition and liquidity.\nThis section provides a discussion of our financial condition and liquidity as of March 27, 2021, which includes (i) an analysis of our financial condition as compared to the prior fiscal year-end; (ii) an analysis of changes in our cash flows for Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 as compared to the respective prior fiscal year; (iii) an analysis of our liquidity, including the availability under our commercial paper borrowing program and credit facilities, our outstanding debt and covenant compliance, common stock repurchases, and payments of dividends; and (iv) a summary of our contractual and other obligations as of March 27, 2021.\n•\nMarket risk management.\nThis section discusses how we manage our risk exposures related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and our investments as of March 27, 2021.\n•\nCritical accounting policies.\nThis section discusses accounting policies considered to be important to our results of operations and financial condition, which typically require significant judgment and estimation on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n•\nRecently issued accounting standards.\nThis section discusses the potential impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition of certain accounting standards that have been recently issued.\nOVERVIEW\nOur Business\nOur Company is a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, fragrances, and hospitality. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across an expanding number of products, brands, sales channels, and international markets. Our brand names include Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Collection, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Polo Ralph Lauren, Double RL, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren Children, Chaps, and Club Monaco, among others.\nWe diversify our business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail, wholesale, and licensing). This allows us to maintain a dynamic balance as our operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or channel of distribution. We sell directly to consumers through our integrated retail channel, which includes our retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. Our wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which we have licensed the right to operate in defined geographic territories using our trademarks. In addition, we license to third parties for specified periods the right to access our various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.\nWe organize our business into the following three reportable segments:\n•\nNorth America\n— Our North America segment, representing approximately 45% of our Fiscal 2021 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S. and Canada, excluding Club Monaco. In North America, our retail business is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, and our digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.com. Our wholesale business in North America is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, and to a lesser extent, specialty stores.\n•\nEurope\n— Our Europe segment, representing approximately 27% of our Fiscal 2021 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America, excluding Club Monaco. In Europe, our retail business is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our various digital commerce sites. Our wholesale business in Europe is comprised of a varying mix of sales to both department stores and specialty stores, depending on the country, as well as to various third-party digital partners.\n•\nAsia\n— Our Asia segment, representing approximately 23% of our Fiscal 2021 net revenues, primarily consists of sales of our Ralph Lauren branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Our retail business in Asia is primarily comprised of our Ralph Lauren stores, our factory stores, our concession-based shop-within-shops, and our various digital commerce sites. In addition, we sell our products online through various third-party digital partner commerce sites. Our wholesale business in Asia is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, with related products distributed through shop-within-shops.\nNo operating segments were aggregated to form our reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, we also have other non-reportable segments, representing approximately 5% of our Fiscal 2021 net revenues, which primarily consist of (i) sales of Club Monaco branded products made through our retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and our licensing alliances in Europe and Asia, and (ii) royalty revenues earned through our global licensing alliances, excluding Club Monaco. As discussed in\n\"Recent Developments,\"\non May 13, 2021, we announced the anticipated sale of our Club Monaco business, which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2022.\nApproximately 52% of our Fiscal 2021 net revenues were earned outside of the U.S. See Note 20 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our segment reporting structure.\nOur business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of retail sales in our second and third fiscal quarters and higher wholesale sales in our second and fourth fiscal quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping periods impacting our retail business and timing of seasonal wholesale shipments. As a result of changes in our business, consumer spending patterns, and the macroeconomic environment, including those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events, historical quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition, fluctuations in sales, operating income, and cash flows in any fiscal quarter may be affected by other events affecting retail sales, such as changes in weather patterns.\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus commonly referred to as COVID-19 emerged and spread rapidly across the globe, including throughout all major geographies in which we operate (North America, Europe, and Asia), resulting in adverse economic conditions and business disruptions, as well as significant volatility in global financial markets. Governments worldwide have imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as temporary travel bans, forced business closures, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. Such factors, among others, have resulted in a significant decline in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items. Additionally, during this period of uncertainty, companies across a wide array of industries have implemented various initiatives to reduce operating expenses and preserve cash balances, including work furloughs, reduced pay, and severance actions, which could lower consumers' disposable income levels or willingness to purchase discretionary items. Further, even after such government restrictions and company initiatives are lifted, consumer behavior, spending levels, and/or shopping preferences, such as willingness to congregate in indoor shopping centers or other populated locations, could be adversely affected.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced varying degrees of business disruptions and periods of closure of our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities, as have our wholesale customers, licensing partners, suppliers, and vendors. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2021, the majority of our stores in key markets were closed for an average of 8 to 10 weeks due to government-mandated lockdowns and other restrictions, resulting in significant adverse impacts to our operating results. Resurgences in certain parts of the world resulted in further business disruptions periodically throughout Fiscal 2021, most notably in Europe where a significant number of our stores were closed for approximately two to three months during the second half of Fiscal 2021, including during the holiday period, due to government-mandated lockdowns and other restrictions. Such disruptions have continued into the first quarter of Fiscal 2022, impacting not only our businesses in Europe but also in other regions of the world (notably our retail operations in Japan and our sourcing operations in\nIndia). Further, the majority of our stores that are able to remain open have periodically been subject to limited operating hours and/or customer capacity levels in accordance with local health guidelines, with traffic remaining challenged. Our wholesale and licensing businesses have also been adversely affected, particularly in North America and Europe, as a result of store closures and lower traffic and consumer demand.\nThroughout the pandemic, our priority has been to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees, customers, and the communities in which we operate around the world. We continue to consider the guidance of local governments and global health organizations and have implemented new health and safety protocols in our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities. We have also taken various preemptive actions to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position, including:\n•\namending our Global Credit Facility in May 2020 to temporarily waive our leverage ratio requirement (see Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements);\n•\nissuing $1.250 billion of unsecured senior notes in June 2020, the proceeds of which are being used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of certain of our previously outstanding borrowings (see Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements);\n•\ntemporarily suspending our quarterly cash dividend and common stock repurchase program, effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 (see Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements);\n•\ntemporarily reducing the base compensation of our executives and senior management team, as well as our Board of Directors, for the first quarter of Fiscal 2021;\n•\nfurloughing or reducing work hours for a significant portion of our employees during the first half of Fiscal 2021;\n•\ncarefully managing our expense structure across all key areas of spend, including aligning inventory levels with anticipated demand, negotiating rent abatements with certain of our landlords, and postponing non-critical capital build-out and other investments and activities;\n•\npursuing relevant government subsidy programs related to COVID-19 business disruptions; and\n•\nimproving upon our cash conversion cycle largely driven by our accounts receivable collection efforts and extended vendor payment terms.\nDespite the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, the pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve. Accordingly, we cannot predict for how long and to what extent the pandemic will impact our business operations or the global economy as a whole. We will continue to assess our operations location-by-location, considering the guidance of local governments and global health organizations to determine when our operations can begin returning to normal levels of business. See Item 1A — \"\nRisk Factors\n—\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\n—\nInfectious disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business\n\"\nfor additional discussion regarding risks to our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan\nWe have begun efforts to realign our resources to support future growth and profitability, and to create a sustainable cost structure. The key areas of our evaluation include our: (i) team organizational structures and ways of working; (ii) real estate footprint and related costs across corporate offices, distribution centers, and direct-to-consumer retail and wholesale doors; and (iii) brand portfolio.\nIn connection with the first initiative, on September 17, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the \"Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan\") to reduce our global workforce by the end of Fiscal 2021. Additionally, during our preliminary review of our store portfolio during the second quarter of Fiscal 2021, we made the decision to close our Polo store on Regent Street in London.\nOn October 29, 2020, we announced the planned transition of our Chaps brand to a fully licensed business model, consistent with our long-term brand elevation strategy in connection with our third initiative (see \"\nTransition of Chaps Brand to a Licensing Model\"\nfurther below for additional discussion).\nAdditionally, on February 3, 2021, our Board of Directors approved additional realignment actions related to our real estate initiative. Specifically, we plan to further rightsize and consolidate our global corporate offices to better align with our\ncurrent organizational profile and new ways of working. We also expect to close certain of our stores to improve overall profitability. Additionally, we plan to complete the consolidation of our existing North America distribution centers in order to drive greater efficiencies, improve sustainability, and deliver a better consumer experience.\nFinally, on May 13, 2021, in connection with our brand portfolio initiative, we announced that we have entered into an agreement to sell our Club Monaco business to Regent, L.P., a global private equity firm. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2022.\nIn connection with these collective realignment initiatives, we expect to incur total estimated pre-tax charges of approximately $300 million to $350 million, of which $236.8 million was recorded during Fiscal 2021. Once substantially completed by the end of Fiscal 2022, these actions are expected to result in gross annualized pre-tax expense savings of approximately $200 million to $240 million, a portion of which will be reinvested back into the business. These estimated charges and expense savings are subject to change based upon the completion of the sale of our Club Monaco business.\nSee Note 9 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Restructuring Plan.\nTransition of Chaps Brand to a Fully Licensed Business Model\nOn October 29, 2020, we announced the planned transition of our Chaps brand to a fully licensed business model, consistent with our long-term brand elevation strategy. Specifically, we have entered into a multi-year licensing partnership, taking effect on August 1, 2021 after a transition period, with an affiliate of 5 Star Apparel LLC, a division of the OVED Group, to manufacture, market, and distribute Chaps menswear and womenswear. The products will be sold at existing channels of distribution with opportunities for expansion into additional channels and markets globally.\nThis agreement is expected to create incremental value for the Company by enabling an even greater focus on elevating our core brands in the marketplace, reducing our direct exposure to the North America department store channel, and setting up Chaps to deliver on its potential with an experienced partner that is focused on nurturing the brand.\nSwiss Tax Reform\nIn May 2019, a public referendum was held in Switzerland that approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (the \"Swiss Tax Act\"), which became effective January 1, 2020. The Swiss Tax Act eliminates certain preferential tax items at both the federal and cantonal levels for multinational companies and provides the cantons with parameters for establishing local tax rates and regulations. The Swiss Tax Act also provides transitional provisions, one of which allows eligible companies to increase the tax basis of certain assets based on the value generated by their business in previous years, and to amortize such adjustment as a tax deduction over a transitional period.\nIn connection with this transitional provision, we recorded a one-time income tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax asset of $122.9 million during Fiscal 2020, which reduced our effective tax rate by 3,760 basis points. Subsequently, during Fiscal 2021, we reduced this one-time tax benefit by $13.8 million due to new legislation enacted in connection with the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, which increased our effective rate by 1,840 basis points.\nSee Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the Swiss Tax Act.\nFiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan\nOn June 4, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan associated with our strategic objective of operating with discipline to drive sustainable growth (the \"Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan\"). The Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan included the following activities: (i) rightsizing and consolidation of our global distribution network and corporate offices; (ii) targeted severance-related actions; and (iii) closure of certain of our stores and shop-within-shops. Actions associated with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan resulted in gross annualized expense savings of approximately $80 million.\nIn connection with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan, we have recorded cumulative charges of $145.8 million since its inception, of which $48.5 million and $97.3 million were recorded during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. Actions associated with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan are complete and no additional charges are expected to be incurred in connection with this plan.\nSee Note 9 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nIn January 2018, new U.S. tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\") became effective. The TCJA significantly revised U.S. tax law by, among other provisions, lowering the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, creating a territorial tax system that includes a one-time mandatory transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings, and eliminating or reducing certain income tax deductions.\nDuring our fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 (\"Fiscal 2018\"), we recorded net charges of $221.4 million within our income tax provision in connection with the TCJA. Subsequently, during Fiscal 2019, we recorded net unfavorable measurement period adjustments of $27.6 million as permitted by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. These measurement period adjustments increased our effective tax rate by 470 basis points during Fiscal 2019.\nSee Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the TCJA.\nGlobal Economic Conditions and Industry Trends\nThe global economy and retail industry are impacted by many different factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in heightened uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy, as well as significant volatility in global financial markets. As discussed in \"\nRecent Developments,\"\ngovernments worldwide have imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as temporary travel bans, forced business closures, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. Such actions, together with changes in consumers' willingness to congregate in populated areas and lower levels of disposal income due to high unemployment rates, have resulted in significant business disruptions across a wide array of industries and an overall decline of the global economy. Despite the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, it is not clear at this time how much longer the pandemic will last.\nThe global economy has also been impacted by the domestic and international political environment, including volatile international trade relations and civil and political unrest taking place in certain parts of the world. The U.S. in particular has experienced civil unrest centered around racial inequality and political allegiances. Additionally, the United Kingdom recently withdrew from the European Union, commonly referred to as \"Brexit,\" whereby it ceased to be a member effective January 31, 2020. In December 2020, the United Kingdom and the European Union entered into an agreement that defines their future relationship, including terms of trade, that among its provisions will result in new tariffs on goods imported to the United Kingdom from the European Union that were manufactured elsewhere, as well as require additional administrative effort to import and export goods, adding friction and cost to transportation. Further, certain other worldwide events, including diplomatic tensions between the U.S. and China, acts of terrorism, taxation or monetary policy changes, fluctuations in commodity prices, and rising healthcare costs, also increase volatility in the global economy.\nThe retail landscape in which we operate has been significantly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including widespread temporary closures of stores and distribution centers and declines in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers had been increasingly shifting their shopping preference from physical stores to online. This shift in preference has accelerated during the pandemic and could be further amplified in the future as consumers may continue to prefer to avoid populated locations, such as shopping centers, in fear of exposing themselves to infectious diseases. Even before the pandemic, many retailers, including certain of our large wholesale customers, have been highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise on a periodic basis in an attempt to offset declines in physical store traffic. The retail industry, particularly in the U.S., has also experienced numerous bankruptcies, restructurings, and ownership changes in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic could exacerbate these trends if companies do not have adequate financial resources and/or access to additional capital to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions. The continuation of these industry trends could further impact consumer spending and consumption behavior in our industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.\nWe have implemented various strategies globally to help address many of these current challenges and continue to build a foundation for long-term profitable growth centered around strengthening our consumer-facing areas of product, stores, and marketing across channels and driving a more efficient operating model. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken preemptive actions to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position, as described in\n\"Recent Developments.\"\nInvesting in our digital ecosystem remains a primary focus and is a key component of our integrated global omni-channel strategy, particularly in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, which has and could continue to reshape consumer shopping preferences. We continue to expand our offering of Connected Retailing capabilities to enhance the consumer experience,\nwhich now include virtual clienteling, Buy Online-Ship to Store, Buy Online-Pick Up in Store, curbside pickup, appointment scheduling, and mobile checkout and contactless payments. Further, during Fiscal 2021, we launched new digital flagships in Japan and Hong Kong, as well as our first subscription apparel rental service, the Lauren Look. We also continue to take deliberate actions to ensure promotional consistency across channels and to enhance the overall brand and shopping experience, including better aligning shipments and inventory levels with underlying demand. We also remain committed to optimizing our wholesale distribution channel and enhancing our department store consumer experience. We are closely monitoring the latest Brexit developments, including the December 2020 trade agreement, and are assessing risks and opportunities and developing strategies to mitigate our exposure.\nWe will continue to monitor these conditions and trends and will evaluate and adjust our operating strategies and foreign currency and cost management opportunities to help mitigate the related impacts on our results of operations, while remaining focused on the long-term growth of our business and protecting and elevating the value of our brand.\nFor a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, see Part I, Item 1A — \"\nRisk Factors\n\" included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSummary of Financial Performance\nOperating Results\nIn Fiscal 2021, we reported net revenues of $4.401 billion, a net loss of $121.1 million, and net loss per diluted share of $1.65, as compared to net revenues of $6.160 billion, net income of $384.3 million, and net income per diluted share of $4.98 in Fiscal 2020. The comparability of our operating results has been affected by net adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions, as well as restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other benefits (charges), including one-time income tax events, as discussed further below.\nOur operating performance for Fiscal 2021 reflected revenue declines of 28.6% on a reported basis and 29.9% on a constant currency basis, as defined within \"\nTransactions and Trends Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n\"\nbelow. The decrease in net revenues during Fiscal 2021 was largely due to declines in North America and Europe driven by COVID-19 business disruptions.\nOur gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased by 570 basis points to 65.0% during Fiscal 2021, primarily driven by improved pricing and lower levels of promotional activity, lower non-routine inventory charges, and favorable geographic and channel mix.\nSelling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased by 740 basis points to 60.0% during Fiscal 2021, primarily driven by operating deleverage on lower net revenues, partially offset by expense savings across various categories.\nNet income decreased by $505.4 million to a net loss of $121.1 million in Fiscal 2021 as compared to Fiscal 2020, primarily due to a $360.6 million decline in operating income driven by COVID-19 business disruptions, a $104.2 million increase in our income tax provision, and higher non-operating expense, net. Net income per diluted share decreased by $6.63 to a net loss of $1.65 per share in Fiscal 2021 as compared to Fiscal 2020, due to the lower level of net income.\nOur operating results during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 included net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges totaling $254.4 million and $321.8 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $201.5 million, or $2.71 per diluted share, and $244.8 million, or $3.17 per diluted share, respectively. Net income (loss) during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 also reflected $46.6 million of incremental net tax expense and an income tax benefit of $122.9 million, respectively, recorded in connection with one-time income tax events.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nWe ended Fiscal 2021 in a net cash and investments position (cash and cash equivalents plus investments, less total debt) of $1.144 billion, compared to $945.3 million as of the end of Fiscal 2020. The increase in our net cash and investments position was primarily due to our operating cash flows of $380.9 million, partially offset by our use of cash to invest in our business through $107.8 million in capital expenditures, to make dividend payments of $49.8 million (which had been previously declared during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020), and to support Class A common stock repurchases of $37.7 million, representing withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based compensation awards.\nWe generated $380.9 million of cash from operations during Fiscal 2021, compared to $754.6 million during Fiscal 2020. The decline in cash provided by operating activities was due to a decrease in net income before non-cash charges, partially offset by a net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year period.\nOur equity decreased to $2.604 billion as of March 27, 2021, compared to $2.693 billion as of March 28, 2020, primarily due to our comprehensive loss and shares surrendered for tax withholdings, partially offset by the impact of stock-based compensation arrangements during Fiscal 2021.\nTransactions and Trends Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nThe comparability of our operating results for the three fiscal years presented herein has been affected by certain events, including:\n•\npretax charges incurred in connection with our restructuring activities, as well as certain other asset impairments and other benefits (charges), including those related to COVID-19 business disruptions, as summarized below (references to \"Notes\" are to the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements):\n(a)\nFiscal 2020 includes a $7.1 million impairment of an equity method investment recorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. All other impairment charges were recorded within impairment of assets in the consolidated statements of operations.\n(b)\nNon-routine inventory charges are recorded within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 includes non-routine inventory charges of $21.0 million and $157.3 million, respectively, related to adverse impacts associated with COVID-19 business disruptions. All other non-routine inventory charges related to our restructuring plans (see Note 9).\n(c)\nCOVID-19-related bad debt reversals (expense) are recorded within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\n•\nother adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020;\n•\nadverse impacts related to Hong Kong protest business disruptions during Fiscal 2020;\n•\nincremental net tax expense of $46.6 million recorded within our income tax provision during Fiscal 2021 related to a valuation allowance provided against domestic losses attributable to COVID-19 business disruptions, international tax legislation enacted in connection with the European Union’s anti-tax avoidance directive, and a net operating loss carryback under the CARES Act, which collectively negatively impacted our effective tax rate by 6,230 basis points;\n•\na one-time benefit of $122.9 million recorded within our income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations during Fiscal 2020 in connection with the Swiss Tax Act, which reduced our effective tax rate by 3,760 basis points. During Fiscal 2021, we reduced this one-time tax benefit by $13.8 million due to new legislation enacted, which increased the Company's effective tax rate by 1,840 basis points. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion; and\n•\nTCJA enactment-related charges of $27.6 million recorded within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations during Fiscal 2019, which increased our effective tax rate by 470 basis points. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nBecause we are a global company, the comparability of our operating results reported in U.S. Dollars is also affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying currencies in which we transact change in value over time compared to the U.S. Dollar. Such fluctuations can have a significant effect on our reported results. As such, in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\"), our discussions often contain references to constant currency measures, which are calculated by translating current-year and prior-year reported amounts into comparable amounts using a single foreign exchange rate for each currency. We present constant currency financial information, which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, as a supplement to our reported operating results. We use constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our businesses performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We believe this information is useful to investors for facilitating comparisons of operating results and better identifying trends in our businesses. The constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations between this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included in the \"Results of Operations\" section where applicable.\nOur discussion also includes reference to comparable store sales. Comparable store sales refer to the change in sales of our stores that have been open for at least 13 full fiscal months. Sales from our digital commerce sites are also included within comparable sales for those geographies that have been serviced by the related site for at least 13 full fiscal months. Sales for stores or digital commerce sites that are closed or shut down during the year are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage expansion of 25% or greater), or generally closed for 30 or more consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales until such stores have been operating in their new location or in their newly renovated state for at least 13 full fiscal months. All comparable store sales metrics are calculated on a constant currency basis.\nOur \"Results of Operations\" discussion that follows includes the significant changes in operating results arising from these items affecting comparability. However, unusual items or transactions may occur in any period. Accordingly, investors and other financial statement users should consider the types of events and transactions that have affected operating trends.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations and expresses the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain financial statement captions. All percentages shown in the below table and the discussion that follows have been calculated using unrounded numbers.\n(a)\nEffective tax rate is calculated by dividing the income tax benefit (provision) by income (loss) before income taxes.\nNM    Not meaningful.\nNet Revenues.\nNet revenues decreased by $1.759 billion, or 28.6%, to $4.401 billion in Fiscal 2021 as compared to Fiscal 2020, including net favorable foreign currency effects of $80.7 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $1.840 billion, or 29.9%.\nThe following table summarizes the percentage change in our Fiscal 2021 consolidated comparable store sales as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions:\nOur global average store count increased by 20 stores and concession shops during Fiscal 2021 compared with the prior fiscal year, largely driven by new openings in Asia. The following table details our retail store presence by segment as of the periods presented:\nIn addition to our stores, we sell products online in North America, Europe, and Asia through our various digital commerce sites, as well as through our Polo mobile app in North America and the United Kingdom. We also sell products online through various third-party digital partner commerce sites, primarily in Asia.\nNet revenues for our segments, as well as a discussion of the changes in each reportable segment's net revenues from the prior fiscal year, are provided below:\nNorth America net revenues\n— Net revenues decreased by $1.148 billion, or 36.6%, during Fiscal 2021 as compared to Fiscal 2020, on both a reported and constant currency basis.\nThe $1.148 billion net decline in North America net revenues was driven by:\n•\na $634.9 million net decrease related to our North America wholesale business, driven by COVID-19 business disruptions and continued challenging department store traffic trends; and\n•\na $513.2 million net decrease related to our North America retail business, inclusive of the adverse impact of COVID-19 business disruptions. On a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $513.1 million driven by decreases of $498.4 million in comparable store sales and $14.7 million in non-comparable store sales. The following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our North America retail business, inclusive of adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions:\nEurope net revenues\n— Net revenues decreased by $466.3 million, or 28.6%, during Fiscal 2021 as compared to Fiscal 2020, including net favorable foreign currency effects of $52.1 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $518.4 million, or 31.8%.\nThe $466.3 million net decline in Europe net revenues was driven by:\n•\na $357.5 million net decrease related to our Europe retail business, inclusive of the adverse impact of COVID-19 business disruptions, as well as net favorable foreign currency effects of $15.1 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $372.6 million driven by decreases of $336.2 million in comparable store sales and $36.4 million in non-comparable store sales. The following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our Europe retail business, inclusive of adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions:\n•\na $108.8 million net decrease related to our Europe wholesale business driven by COVID-19 business disruptions partially offset by net favorable foreign currency effects of $37.0 million.\nAsia net revenues\n— Net revenues increased by $10.3 million, or 1.0%, during Fiscal 2021 as compared to Fiscal 2020, including net favorable foreign currency effects of $28.5 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $18.2 million, or 1.8%.\nThe $10.3 million net increase in Asia net revenues was driven by:\n•\na $20.4 million net increase related to our Asia retail business, inclusive of the adverse impact of COVID-19 business disruptions, as well as net favorable foreign currency effects of $26.9 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $6.5 million, reflecting a decrease of $43.1 million in comparable store sales, partially offset by an increase of $36.6 million in non-comparable store sales. The following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our Asia retail business, inclusive of adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions:\nThis increase was partially offset by a $10.1 million net decrease related to our Asia wholesale business driven by COVID-19 business disruptions, primarily in Japan.\nGross Profit.\nGross profit decreased by $791.9 million, or 21.7%, to $2.861 billion in Fiscal 2021, including net favorable foreign currency effects of $60.2 million. Gross profit during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 reflects adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions, including incremental inventory charges of $21.0 million and $157.3 million, respectively. Gross profit during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 also reflects inventory charges of $8.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively, recorded in connection with our restructuring plans. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 65.0% in Fiscal 2021 from 59.3% in Fiscal 2020. The 570 basis point improvement was primarily driven by improved pricing and lower levels of promotional activity, lower non-routine inventory charges recorded during Fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year, and favorable geographic and channel mix.\nGross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products sold, pricing, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses.\nSG&A expenses include compensation and benefits, advertising and marketing, rent and occupancy, distribution, information technology, legal, depreciation and amortization, bad debt, and other selling and administrative costs. SG&A expenses decreased by $599.0 million, or 18.5%, to $2.639 billion in Fiscal 2021, including net unfavorable foreign currency effect of $40.7 million. The decrease in SG&A expenses reflects impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions and our related mitigating actions, including (i) lower compensation-related expenses largely driven by employee furloughs and terminations, reduced pay for our executives, senior management team, and Board of Directors, and COVID-19-related government subsidies, (ii) lower rent and occupancy costs largely driven by reduced percentage-of-sales-based rent due to store closures and a reduction in traffic, as well as rent abatements negotiated with certain of our landlords, (iii) favorable COVID-19-related bad debt expense adjustments, and (iv) our operational discipline. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 60.0% in Fiscal 2021 from 52.6% in Fiscal 2020. The 740 basis point increase was primarily due to operating deleverage on lower net revenues, partially offset by expense savings across various categories.\nThe $599.0 million decrease in SG&A expenses was driven by:\nWe have been carefully evaluating our organizational and operating cost structures to better support long-term growth, with a focus on our (i) team organizational structures and ways of working; (ii) real estate footprint and related costs across our corporate offices, distribution centers, and direct-to-consumer retail and wholesale doors; and (iii) brand portfolio. Additionally, we plan to continue to closely manage our discretionary spending.\nImpairment of Assets.\nDuring Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $96.0 million and $31.6 million, respectively, to write-down certain long-lived assets. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nRestructuring and Other Charges.\nDuring Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, we recorded restructuring charges of $159.1 million and $37.6 million, respectively, primarily consisting of severance and benefits costs, as well as other charges of $11.4 million and $8.8 million, respectively, primarily related to rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations for which the related lease agreements have not yet expired. Additionally, during Fiscal 2020, we recorded other charges of $20.8 million related to the charitable donation of the net cash proceeds received from the sale of our corporate jet. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Income (Loss).\nDuring Fiscal 2021, we reported an operating loss of $43.6 million, as compared to operating income of $317.0 million during Fiscal 2020. The $360.6 million decline in operating income reflects net adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions, as well as net favorable foreign currency effects of $19.5 million. Our operating\nresults during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 were also negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges (a portion of which related to COVID-19 business disruptions) totaling $254.4 million and $321.8 million, respectively, as previously discussed. Operating loss as a percentage of net revenues was 1.0% in Fiscal 2021, reflecting a 610 basis point decline from Fiscal 2020. The decline in operating income as a percentage of net revenues was primarily driven by the increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by the increase in our gross margin and lower net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges recorded during Fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year, all as previously discussed.\nOperating income (loss) and margin for our segments, as well as a discussion of the changes in each reportable segment's operating margin from the prior fiscal year, are provided below:\nNorth America operating margin\nimproved by 230 basis points, primarily due to approximately 400 basis points attributable to net lower non-routine inventory charges and COVID-19-related bad debt expense recorded during Fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by higher impairment of assets recorded during the current fiscal year. Partially offsetting this net favorable improvement in operating margin were the unfavorable impacts of approximately 90 basis points and 60 basis points attributable to our wholesale and retail businesses, respectively, both largely driven by an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by an increase in our gross margin. Our North America operating margin also reflected the unfavorable impact of approximately 20 basis points attributable to other factors, including unfavorable channel mix.\nEurope operating margin\ndeclined by 440 basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of approximately 790 basis points related to our retail business largely driven by an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by an increase in our gross margin. This decline in operating income was partially offset by approximately 180 basis points attributable to favorable channel mix and 160 basis points attributable to net lower non-routine inventory charges and COVID-19-related bad debt expense recorded during Fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by higher impairment of assets recorded during the current fiscal year. The remaining change in operating margin was attributable to other factors, including slight improvement in our wholesale business.\nAsia operating margin\nimproved by 210 basis points, primarily due to approximately 190 basis points attributable to net lower non-routine inventory charges, COVID-19-related bad debt expense, and impairment of assets recorded during Fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year, as well as favorable foreign currency effects of approximately 60 basis points. The increase in operating margin also reflected the favorable impact of approximately 20 basis points related to our retail business. These increases in operating margin were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points related to our wholesale business largely driven by an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues. The remaining change in operating margin was attributable to other factors, including unfavorable channel mix.\nUnallocated corporate expenses\ndecreased by $41.1 million to $577.0 million in Fiscal 2021. The decline in unallocated corporate expenses was due to lower compensation-related expenses of $87.3 million and lower rent and occupancy costs of $24.3 million, partially offset by lower intercompany sourcing commission income of $33.9 million (which is offset at the segment level and eliminates in consolidation), higher impairment of asset charges of $33.2 million, and higher other expenses of $3.4 million.\nUnallocated restructuring and other charges\nincreased by $103.3 million to $170.5 million in Fiscal 2021, as previously discussed above and in Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNon-operating Income (Expense), Net.\nNon-operating income (expense), net is comprised of interest expense, interest income, and other income (expense), net, which includes foreign currency gains (losses), equity in income (losses) from our equity-method investees, and other non-operating expenses. During Fiscal 2021, we reported non-operating expense, net, of $31.2 million, as compared to non-operating income, net, of $9.4 million in Fiscal 2020. The $40.6 million decline in non-operating income was driven by:\n•\na $30.9 million increase in interest expense, primarily driven by the net increase in our borrowings during Fiscal 2021 (see \"\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity — Cash Flows\n\"); and\n•\na $24.7 million decline in interest income, primarily driven by the decrease in our investment portfolio and lower interest rates in financial markets.\nThese unfavorable variances were partially offset by a $15.0 million favorable change in other income (expense), net, primarily driven by the absence of a $7.1 million impairment of an equity method investment recorded during Fiscal 2020, as well as higher net foreign currency gains during Fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Provision).\nThe income tax benefit (provision) represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. Our effective tax rate will change from period to period based on various factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements, and the interaction of various global tax strategies.\nWe reported an income tax provision and effective tax rate of $46.3 million and (61.9%), respectively, in Fiscal 2021, as compared to an income tax benefit and effective tax rate of $57.9 million and (17.7%), respectively, in Fiscal 2020. The $104.2 million increase in our income tax provision was driven by the absence of a one-time benefit of $122.9 million recorded in connection with Swiss tax reform during the prior fiscal year, which reduced our prior fiscal year effective tax rate by 3,760 basis points. Our income tax provision in Fiscal 2021 also reflected incremental tax expense of $33.7 million primarily related to a valuation allowance provided against domestic losses attributable to significant COVID-19 business disruptions and $13.8 million related to international tax legislation enacted in connection with the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, partially offset by an income tax benefit of $0.9 million primarily due to a net operating loss carryback under the CARES Act. Collectively, this $46.6 million of net incremental tax expense unfavorably impacted our current fiscal period effective tax rate by 6,230 basis points. The remaining 1,950 basis point decline was attributable to tax impacts on stock-based compensation, as well as the absence of favorable settlements of certain international income tax audits that impacted the prior fiscal year. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNet Income (Loss).\nWe reported a net loss of $121.1 million in Fiscal 2021, as compared to net income of $384.3 million in Fiscal 2020. The $505.4 million decline in net income was primarily due to the decline in our operating income, the increase in our income tax provision, and higher non-operating expense, net, all as previously discussed. Our operating results during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 included net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges totaling $254.4 million and $321.8 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $201.5 million and $244.8 million, respectively. Net income (loss) during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 also reflected $46.6 million of incremental net tax expense and an income tax benefit of $122.9 million, respectively, recorded in connection with one-time income tax events, as previously discussed.\nNet Income (Loss) per Diluted Share.\nWe reported a net loss per diluted share of $1.65 in Fiscal 2021, as compared to net income per diluted share of $4.98 in Fiscal 2020. The $6.63 per share decline was due to the lower level of net income, as previously discussed.  Net income (loss) per diluted share in Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 were negatively impacted by $2.71 per share and $3.17 per share, respectively, as a result of net restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges, as previously discussed. Net income (loss) per diluted share in Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 were also negatively impacted by $0.64 per share due to incremental net tax expense and favorably impacted by $1.59 per share due to an income tax benefit, respectively, recorded in connection with one-time tax events, as previously discussed.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations and expresses the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain financial statement captions. All percentages shown in the below table and the discussion that follows have been calculated using unrounded numbers.\n(a)\nEffective tax rate is calculated by dividing the income tax benefit (provision) by income before income taxes.\nNM    Not meaningful.\nNet Revenues.\nNet revenues decreased by $153.2 million, or 2.4%, to $6.160 billion in Fiscal 2020 as compared to Fiscal 2019, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $77.1 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $76.1 million, or 1.2%, reflecting adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions.\nThe following table summarizes the percentage change in our Fiscal 2020 consolidated comparable store sales as compared to the prior fiscal year, inclusive of adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions:\nOur global average store count increased by 43 stores and concession shops during Fiscal 2020 compared with the prior fiscal year, largely driven by new openings in Asia and Europe. The following table details our retail store presence by segment as of the periods presented:\nIn addition to our stores, we sold products online in North America and Europe through our various digital commerce sites, which include www.RalphLauren.com and www.ClubMonaco.com, among others, as well as through our Polo mobile app in North America and the United Kingdom. In Asia, we sold products online through our digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.cn, which launched in September 2018, as well as through various third-party digital partner commerce sites.\nNet revenues for our segments, as well as a discussion of the changes in each reportable segment's net revenues from the prior fiscal year, are provided below:\nNorth America net revenues\n— Net revenues decreased by $62.4 million, or 2.0%, during Fiscal 2020 as compared to Fiscal 2019, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $1.4 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $61.0 million, or 1.9%, reflecting adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions.\nThe $62.4 million net decline in North America net revenues was driven by:\n•\na $101.2 million net decrease related to our North America wholesale business, largely driven by weaker demand and challenging department store traffic trends, as well as COVID-19 business disruptions.\nThis decrease was partially offset by:\n•\nan increase of $38.8 million related to our North America retail business, inclusive of net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $0.7 million and the adverse impact of COVID-19 business disruptions. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $39.5 million driven by an increase of $47.1 million in non-comparable\nstore sales, partially offset by a decrease of $7.6 million in comparable store sales. The following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our North America retail business, inclusive of adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions:\nEurope net revenues\n— Net revenues decreased by $50.8 million, or 3.0%, during Fiscal 2020 as compared to Fiscal 2019, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $63.6 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $12.8 million, or 0.8%, despite adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions.\nThe $50.8 million net decline in Europe net revenues was driven by:\n•\na $44.3 million net decrease related to our Europe wholesale business driven by net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $32.3 million and COVID-19 business disruptions, partially offset by stronger demand prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n•\na $6.5 million net decrease related to our Europe retail business, inclusive of net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $31.3 million and the adverse impact of COVID-19 business disruptions. On a constant currency basis, net revenues increased by $24.8 million driven by an increase of $32.4 million in non-comparable store sales, partially offset by a decrease of $7.6 million in comparable store sales. The following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our Europe retail business, inclusive of adverse impacts related to COVID-19 business disruptions:\nAsia net revenues\n— Net revenues decreased by $23.8 million, or 2.3%, during Fiscal 2020 as compared to Fiscal 2019, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $11.6 million. On a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $12.2 million, or 1.2%, reflecting adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions.\nThe $23.8 million net decline in Asia net revenues was driven by:\n•\na $21.9 million net decrease related to our Asia retail business, inclusive of net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $10.7 million and the adverse impacts of COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions. On a constant currency basis, net revenues decreased by $11.2 million, reflecting a decrease of $36.4 million in comparable store sales, partially offset by an increase of $25.2 million in non-comparable store sales. The following table summarizes the percentage change in comparable store sales related to our Asia retail business, inclusive of adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions:\n•\na $1.9 million net decrease related to our Asia wholesale business, inclusive of net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $0.9 million and the adverse impact of COVID-19 business disruptions.\nGross Profit.\nGross profit decreased by $232.7 million, or 6.0%, to $3.653 billion in Fiscal 2020, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $53.7 million. The decline in gross profit reflects adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions, including incremental inventory charges of $157.3 million. Gross profit during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 also reflected inventory charges of $2.2 million and $7.2 million, respectively, recorded in connection with our restructuring plans. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 59.3% in Fiscal 2020 from\n61.6% in Fiscal 2019. The 230 basis point decline was primarily driven by higher inventory charges and deleverage on lower net revenues, partially offset by favorable geographic, channel, and product mix, improved pricing, and lower levels of promotional activity.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses.\nSG&A expenses increased by $69.2 million, or 2.2%, to $3.238 billion in Fiscal 2020, including net favorable foreign currency effects of $35.5 million. The increase in SG&A expenses reflects net adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions, including incremental bad debt expense of $56.4 million. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 52.6% in Fiscal 2020 from 50.2% in Fiscal 2019. The 240 basis point increase was primarily due to operating deleverage on lower net revenues and higher bad debt expense, both primarily attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the unfavorable impact attributable to geographic and channel mix, as a greater portion of our revenue was generated by our retail businesses (which typically carry higher operating expense margins).\nThe $69.2 million net increase in SG&A expenses was driven by:\nImpairment of Assets.\nDuring Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $31.6 million and $21.2 million, respectively, to write-down certain long-lived assets in connection with our restructuring plans and identification of underperforming stores. Additionally, as a result of our decision to sell our corporate jet in connection with our cost savings initiative, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $4.6 million during Fiscal 2019 to reduce the carrying value of the asset being held-for-sale to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nRestructuring and Other Charges.\nDuring Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $37.6 million and $93.6 million, respectively, in connection with our restructuring plans, primarily consisting of severance and benefits costs, as well as a loss on sale of property during the prior fiscal year period. Additionally, during Fiscal 2020, we recorded other charges of $29.6 million primarily related to the charitable donation of the net cash proceeds received from the sale of our corporate jet, and rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations for which the related lease agreements had not yet expired. During Fiscal 2019, we recorded other charges of $36.5 million primarily related to our sabbatical leave program initiated during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, depreciation expense associated with our former Polo store at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York City, and a customs audit. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Income.\nOperating income decreased by $244.8 million, or 43.6%, to $317.0 million in Fiscal 2020, including net unfavorable foreign currency effects of $18.2 million. The decline in operating income reflects net adverse impacts related to COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions, including total incremental inventory charges and bad debt expense of $213.7 million, as previously discussed. Our operating results during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 were also negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other charges totaling $101.0 million and $163.1 million, respectively, as previously discussed. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 5.1% in Fiscal 2020 from 8.9% in Fiscal 2019. The 380 basis point decline was primarily driven by the decline in our gross margin and the increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, partially offset by lower restructuring-related charges recorded during Fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year, all as previously discussed.\nOperating income and margin for our segments, as well as a discussion of the changes in each reportable segment's operating margin from the prior fiscal year, are provided below:\nNorth America operating margin\ndeclined by 600 basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of 450 basis points related to incremental inventory charges and bad debt expense recorded in connection with COVID-19 business disruptions. The remaining 150 basis point decline largely related to adverse market conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEurope operating margin\ndeclined by 270 basis points, primarily due to the net unfavorable impact of 210 basis points related to incremental inventory charges and bad debt expense recorded in connection with COVID-19 business disruptions, partially offset by lower non-cash charges recorded in connection with our restructuring plans during Fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The decline in operating margin also reflected a 40 basis point decline largely related to adverse market conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a 20 basis point decline related to unfavorable foreign currency.\nAsia operating margin\ndeclined by 320 basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of 160 basis points related to incremental inventory charges and bad debt expense recorded in connection with COVID-19 business disruptions. The remaining 160 basis point decline largely related to adverse market conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and Hong Kong protests.\nUnallocated corporate expenses\ndecreased by $18.3 million to $618.1 million in Fiscal 2020. The decline in unallocated corporate expenses was due to lower compensation-related expenses of $11.5 million, lower staff-related expenses of $8.8 million, lower consulting fees of $6.7 million, and lower marketing and advertising expenses of $9.5 million, partially offset by lower intercompany sourcing commission income of $10.2 million (which is offset at the segment level and eliminates in consolidation) and higher other expenses of $8.0 million.\nUnallocated restructuring and other charges\ndecreased by $62.9 million to $67.2 million in Fiscal 2020, as previously discussed above and in Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNon-operating Income (Expense), Net.\nDuring Fiscal 2020, we reported non-operating income, net, of $9.4 million, as compared to $20.7 million in Fiscal 2019. The $11.3 million decline was primarily driven by:\n•\nan $8.0 million increase in other expense, net, driven by a $7.1 million impairment of an equity method investment recorded in Fiscal 2020. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements; and\n•\na $6.4 million decrease in interest income driven by the lower balance of our investment portfolio, as well as lower interest rates in financial markets during Fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Provision).\nWe reported an income tax benefit and effective tax rate of $57.9 million and (17.7%), respectively, in Fiscal 2020, as compared to an income tax provision and effective tax rate of $151.6 million and 26.0%, respectively, in Fiscal 2019. The $209.5 million decline in the income tax provision was largely driven by lower pretax income primarily due to the adverse impacts of COVID-19 and Hong Kong protest business disruptions. The decline in our income tax\nprovision also reflected a one-time benefit of $122.9 million recorded in Fiscal 2020 in connection with the Swiss Tax Act, which lowered our effective tax rate by 3,760 basis points, as well as the absence of a $27.6 million TCJA enactment-related charge recorded in the prior fiscal year, which negatively impacted our prior fiscal year effective tax rate by 470 basis points. In addition to this combined 4,230 basis point improvement related to tax reform impacts, the decline in our effective tax rate also reflected the net favorable impact of 140 basis points primarily attributable to other factors, including the tax impacts of earnings in lower taxed foreign jurisdictions versus the U.S. and favorable provision to tax return adjustments, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of additional income tax reserves associated with certain income tax audits. See Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding the Swiss Tax Act and TCJA.\nNet Income.\nNet income decreased to $384.3 million in Fiscal 2020, from $430.9 million in Fiscal 2019. The $46.6 million decline in net income was primarily due to the decrease in our operating income, partially offset by the decrease in our income tax provision, both as previously discussed. Net income during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 reflected a one-time income tax benefit of $122.9 million recorded in connection with Swiss tax reform and TCJA enactment-related charges of $27.6 million, respectively, both as previously discussed. Our operating results during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 were also negatively impacted by restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets (including an equity method investment), and certain other charges (including those related to COVID-19 business disruptions) totaling $321.8 million and $163.1 million, respectively, which had an after-tax effect of reducing net income by $244.8 million and $129.0 million, respectively.\nNet Income per Diluted Share.\nNet income per diluted share decreased to $4.98 in Fiscal 2020, from $5.27 in Fiscal 2019. The $0.29 per share decline was due to the lower level of net income, as previously discussed, partially offset by lower weighted-average diluted shares outstanding during Fiscal 2020 driven by our share repurchases during Fiscal 2020. Net income per diluted share in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 were favorably impacted by $1.59 per share as a result of a one-time income tax benefit recorded in connection with the Swiss Tax Act and negatively impacted by $0.34 per share as a result of TCJA enactment-related charges, respectively, both as previously discussed. Net income per diluted share in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 were also negatively impacted by $3.17 per share and $1.58 per share, respectively, as a result of restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets (including an equity method investment), and certain other charges (including those related to COVID-19 business disruptions), as previously discussed.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nFinancial Condition\nThe following table presents our financial condition as of March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020.\n(a)\nSee Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the carrying values of our debt.\n(b)\n\"Net cash and investments\" is defined as cash and cash equivalents, plus investments, less total debt.\nThe increase in our net cash and investments position at March 27, 2021 as compared to March 28, 2020 was primarily due to our operating cash flows of $380.9 million, partially offset by our use of cash to invest in our business through $107.8 million in capital expenditures, to make dividend payments of $49.8 million (which had been previously declared during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020), and to support Class A common stock repurchases of $37.7 million, representing withholdings in satisfaction of tax obligations for stock-based compensation awards.\nThe decrease in equity was primarily attributable to our comprehensive loss and shares surrendered for tax withholdings, partially offset by the impact of stock-based compensation arrangements during Fiscal 2021.\nCash Flows\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased to $380.9 million during Fiscal 2021, from $754.6 million during Fiscal 2020. The $373.7 million net decline in cash provided by operating activities was due to a decrease in net income before non-cash charges, partially offset by a net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nThe net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, was primarily driven by:\n•\na favorable change in our accrued liabilities, primarily driven by the increase in our restructuring reserve related to charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan; and\n•\na favorable change in our accounts payable, driven by our extended payment terms.\nThese increases related to our operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by:\n•\nan unfavorable change related to our accounts receivable, largely driven by an increase in wholesale revenue during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020;\n•\nan unfavorable change in inventory, largely driven by lower COVID-19-related inventory charges recorded in Fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior year period; and\n•\nan unfavorable change in our prepaid expenses and other current assets, primarily driven by the timing of cash payments.\nNet Cash Provided by Investing Activities.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $195.0 million during Fiscal 2021, as compared to of $702.1 million during Fiscal 2020. The $507.1 million net decrease in cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by:\n•\na $648.1 million decrease in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, less purchases of investments. During Fiscal 2021, we received net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $302.6 million, as compared to $950.7 million during Fiscal 2020.\nThis decrease in cash provided by investing activities was partially offset by:\n•\na $162.5 million decrease in capital expenditures. During Fiscal 2021, we spent $107.8 million on capital expenditures, as compared to $270.3 million during Fiscal 2020. This decline reflects the temporary postponement of non-critical capital expenditures as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position in response to business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our capital expenditures during Fiscal 2021 primarily related to international store openings and renovations, as well as enhancements to our information technology systems.\nIn Fiscal 2022, we expect to spend approximately $250 million to $275 million on capital expenditures, in-line with our pre-pandemic levels, primarily related to store openings and renovations, as well as further investment in our digital infrastructure.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $356.8 million during Fiscal 2021, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $438.2 million during Fiscal 2020. The $795.0 million net increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by:\n•\na $657.1 million decrease in cash used to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. During Fiscal 2021, $37.7 million in shares of Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under our long-term stock incentive plans and no shares of Class A common stock were repurchased pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, which we have temporarily suspended as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position in response to business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. On a comparative basis, during Fiscal 2020, $650.3 million in shares of Class A common stock were repurchased and $44.5 million in shares of Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld for taxes; and\n•\na $154.1 million decrease in payments of dividends, driven by the temporary suspension of our quarterly cash dividend program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position, as discussed in \"\nDividends\n\" below.\nThese increases in cash provided by financing activities were partially offset by:\n•\nan $8.1 million decrease in cash proceeds from the issuance of debt, less debt repayments. During Fiscal 2021, we received $1.242 billion in proceeds from our issuance of 1.700% unsecured notes and 2.950% unsecured senior notes, a portion of which was used to repay $475 million of borrowings previously outstanding under our credit facilities and our previously outstanding $300 million principal amount of unsecured 2.625% senior notes that matured in August 2020. On a comparative basis, during Fiscal 2020 we borrowed $475 million under our credit facilities as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased to $754.6 million during Fiscal 2020, from $783.8 million during Fiscal 2019. The $29.2 million net decline in cash provided by operating activities was due to a decrease in net income before non-cash charges, partially offset by a net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, as compared to the prior fiscal year. The net favorable change related to our operating assets and liabilities, including our working capital, was primarily driven by:\n•\na favorable change related to our inventories, largely driven by higher inventory charges primarily related to adverse impacts associated with COVID-19 business disruptions;\n•\na favorable change related to our prepaid expenses and other current assets, largely driven by the timing of cash payments; and\n•\na favorable change related to our accounts receivable, largely driven by lower wholesale sales during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior fiscal year driven by COVID-19 business disruptions, as well as the timing of cash receipts.\nThese increases related to our operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by:\n•\nan unfavorable change related to our income tax receivables and payables, largely as a result of the absence of charges recorded during the prior fiscal year in connection with the TCJA's mandatory transition tax; and\n•\nan unfavorable change related to our accrued liabilities driven by larger decreases in our bonus accrual and restructuring reserves as compared to the prior fiscal year, as well as the timing of cash payments.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $702.1 million during Fiscal 2020, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $879.3 million during Fiscal 2019. The $1.581 billion net increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily driven by:\n•\na $1.624 billion increase in proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, less purchases of investments. During Fiscal 2020, we received net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $950.7 million, as compared to making net investment purchases of $673.3 million during Fiscal 2019; and\n•\na $23.8 million decrease in payments made to settle net investment hedges.\nThese increases in cash provided by investing activities were partially offset by:\n•\na $72.6 million increase in capital expenditures. During Fiscal 2020, we spent $270.3 million on capital expenditures, as compared to $197.7 million during Fiscal 2019. Our capital expenditures during Fiscal 2020 primarily related to new store openings, retail and department store renovations, enhancements to our information technology systems, and the consolidation of our corporate office footprint.\nNet Cash Used in Financing Activities.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $438.2 million during Fiscal 2020, as compared to $605.7 million during Fiscal 2019. The $167.5 million net decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by:\n•\na $386.8 million increase in cash proceeds from the issuance of debt, less debt repayments. During Fiscal 2020, we borrowed $475 million under our credit facilities as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. During Fiscal 2019, we received $398.1 million in proceeds from our issuance of 3.750% unsecured senior notes in August 2018, a portion of which was used to repay our previously outstanding $300 million principal amount of unsecured 2.125% senior notes that matured in September 2018. Additionally, during Fiscal 2019 we repaid approximately $10 million that had been borrowed under our credit facilities during Fiscal 2018.\nThis decrease in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by:\n•\na $192.2 million increase in cash used to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. During Fiscal 2020, we used $650.3 million to repurchase shares of Class A common stock pursuant to our common stock repurchase program, and an additional $44.5 million in shares of Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under our long-term stock incentive plans. On a comparative basis, during Fiscal 2019, $470.0 million in shares of Class A common stock were repurchased and $32.6 million in shares of Class A common stock were surrendered or withheld for taxes;\n•\na $21.8 million decrease in proceeds from exercise of stock options; and\n•\na $13.2 million increase in payments of dividends, driven by an increase to the quarterly cash dividend per share (as discussed within \"\nDividends\n\" below). Dividends paid amounted to $203.9 million and $190.7 million during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our operations, our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, availability under our credit and overdraft facilities and commercial paper program, and other available financing options.\nDuring Fiscal 2021, we generated $380.9 million of net cash flows from our operations. As of March 27, 2021, we had $2.777 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, of which $904.6 million were held by our subsidiaries domiciled outside the U.S. We are not dependent on foreign cash to fund our domestic operations. Undistributed foreign earnings that were subject to the TCJA's one-time mandatory transition tax as of December 31, 2017 are not considered to be permanently reinvested and may be repatriated to the U.S. in the future with minimal or no additional U.S. taxation. We intend to permanently reinvest undistributed foreign earnings generated after December 31, 2017 that were not subject to the one-time mandatory transition tax. However, if our plans change and we choose to repatriate post-2017 earnings to the U.S. in the future, we would be subject to applicable U.S. and foreign taxes.\nThe following table presents our total availability, borrowings outstanding, and remaining availability under our credit and overdraft facilities and Commercial Paper Program as of March 27, 2021:\n(a)\nAs defined in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n(b)\nBorrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are supported by the Global Credit Facility. Accordingly, we do not expect combined borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and the Global Credit Facility to exceed $500 million.\n(c)\nRepresents outstanding letters of credit for which we were contingently liable under the Global Credit Facility as of March 27, 2021.\nWe believe that the Global Credit Facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentration in any one financial institution. In particular, as of March 27, 2021, there were eight financial institutions participating in the Global Credit Facility, with no one participant maintaining a maximum commitment percentage in excess of 20%. In accordance with the terms of the agreement, we have the ability to expand our borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to $1 billion through the full term of the facility, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments.\nBorrowings under the Pan-Asia Credit Facilities and Japan Overdraft Facility (collectively, the \"Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities\") are guaranteed by the parent company and are granted at the sole discretion of the participating banks (as described within Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), subject to availability of the respective banks' funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements. We have no reason to believe that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the Global Credit Facility and the Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities in the event of our election to draw additional funds in the foreseeable future.\nOur sources of liquidity are used to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, global retail store and digital commerce expansion, construction and renovation of shop-within-shops, investment in infrastructure, including technology, acquisitions, joint ventures, payment of dividends, debt repayments, Class A common stock repurchases, settlement of contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax positions), and other corporate activities, including our restructuring actions. We believe that our existing sources of cash, the availability under our credit facilities, and our ability to access capital markets will be sufficient to support our operating, capital, and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, the ongoing development of our businesses, and our plans for further business expansion. However, prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions in any of our key regions, or a combination thereof, such as those resulting from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, could impede our ability to pay our obligations as they become due or return value to our shareholders, as well as delay previously planned expenditures related to our operations.\nSee Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our credit facilities.\nDebt and Covenant Compliance\nIn August 2018, we completed a registered public debt offering and issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due September 15, 2025, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.750%, payable semi-annually (the \"3.750% Senior Notes\"). In June 2020, we completed another registered public debt offering and issued an additional $500 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due June 15, 2022, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.700%, payable semi-annually (the \"1.700% Senior Notes\"), and $750 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due June 15, 2030, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.950%, payable semi-annually (the \"2.950% Senior Notes\").\nThe indenture and supplemental indentures governing the 3.750% Senior Notes, 1.700% Senior Notes, and 2.950% Senior Notes (as supplemented, the \"Indenture\") contain certain covenants that restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; consolidate or merge with another party; or sell, lease, or convey all or substantially all of our property or assets to another party. However, the Indenture does not contain any financial covenants.\nWe have a credit facility that provides for a $500 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit through August 12, 2024, which is also used to support the issuance of letters of credit and the maintenance of the Commercial Paper Program (the \"Global Credit Facility\"). Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. Dollars and other currencies, including Euros, Hong Kong Dollars, and Japanese Yen. We have the ability to expand the borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to $1 billion, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the Global Credit Facility.\nIn March 2020, we borrowed $475.0 million under the Global Credit Facility as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was subsequently repaid in June 2020.\nThe Global Credit Facility contains a number of covenants, as described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of March 27, 2021, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Global Credit Facility) has occurred under our Global Credit Facility. The Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities do not contain any financial covenants.\nSee Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our debt and covenant compliance.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nOn May 13, 2019, our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our existing common stock repurchase program that allowed us to repurchase up to an additional $600 million of Class A common stock. As of March 27, 2021, the remaining availability under our Class A common stock repurchase program was approximately $580 million. Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are subject to certain restrictions under our Global Credit Facility and more generally overall business and market conditions. Accordingly, as a result of business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 we temporarily suspended our common stock repurchase program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position.\nSee Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our Class A common stock repurchase program.\nDividends\nExcept as discussed below, we have maintained a regular quarterly cash dividend program on our common stock since 2003. On May 13, 2019, our Board of Directors approved an increase to the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.625 to $0.6875 per share.\nAs a result of business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 we temporarily suspended our quarterly cash dividend program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position. On May 19, 2021, our Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of our quarterly cash dividend program at the pre-pandemic amount of $0.6875 per share. The first quarterly dividend since such reinstatement will be payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 25, 2021, and will be paid on July 9, 2021.\nWe intend to continue to pay regular dividends on our outstanding common stock. However, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant, including economic and market conditions.\nContractual and Other Obligations\nFirm Commitments\nThe following table summarizes certain of our aggregate contractual obligations as of March 27, 2021, and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. We expect to fund these firm commitments with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business and, if necessary, through availability under our credit facilities or other accessible sources of financing.\nThe following is a description of our material, firmly committed obligations as of March 27, 2021:\n•\nSenior Notes\nrepresent the principal amount of our outstanding 3.750% Senior Notes, 1.700% Senior Notes, and 2.950% Senior Notes. Amounts do not include any fair value adjustments, call premiums, unamortized debt issuance costs, or interest payments (see below);\n•\nInterest payments on debt\nrepresent the semi-annual contractual interest payments due on our 3.750% Senior Notes, 1.700% Senior Notes, and 2.950% Senior Notes. Amounts do not include the impact of potential cash flows underlying our related swap contracts (see Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our swap contracts);\n•\nLease obligations\nrepresent fixed payments due over the lease term of our noncancelable leases of real estate and operating equipment, including rent, real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance fees, and/or certain other costs. For lease terms that have commenced, information has been presented separately for operating and finance leases. Other lease commitments relate to executed lease agreements for which the related lease terms have not yet commenced as of March 27, 2021;\n•\nInventory purchase commitments\nrepresent our legally-binding agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of goods at determinable prices;\n•\nMandatory transition tax payments\nrepresent our remaining tax obligation incurred in connection with the deemed repatriation of previously deferred foreign earnings pursuant to the TCJA (see Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of the TCJA); and\n•\nOther commitments\nprimarily represent our legally-binding obligations under sponsorship, licensing, and other marketing and advertising agreements; information technology-related service agreements; and pension-related obligations.\nExcluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $91.4 million as of March 27, 2021, as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever. The above table also excludes the following: (i) amounts recorded in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of March 27, 2021, which will be paid within one year, other than lease obligations, mandatory transition tax payments, and accrued interest payments on debt; and (ii) non-current liabilities that have no cash outflows associated with them (e.g., deferred income), or the cash outflows associated with them are uncertain or do not represent a \"purchase obligation\" as such term is used herein (e.g., deferred taxes, derivative financial instruments, and other miscellaneous items).\nWe also have certain contractual arrangements that would require us to make payments if certain events or circumstances occur. See Note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of our contingent commitments not included in the above table.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn addition to the commitments included in the above table, our other off-balance sheet firm commitments relating to our outstanding letters of credit amounted to $8.9 million as of March 27, 2021. We do not maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nAs discussed in Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we are exposed to a variety of risks, including the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on foreign currency-denominated balances, certain anticipated cash flows of our international operations, and the value of reported net assets of our foreign operations, as well as changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations relating to fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. Accordingly, at times, in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage such risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.\nGiven our use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that the counterparties to such contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate such counterparty credit risk, it is our policy to only enter into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon an evaluation of their credit ratings and certain other factors, adhering to established limits for credit exposure. Our established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk include ongoing review and assessment of the creditworthiness of our counterparties. We also enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties, when possible, to further mitigate credit risk. As a result of the above considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to undue concentration of counterparty risk with respect to our derivative contracts as of March 27, 2021. However, we do have in aggregate $15.7 million of derivative instruments in net asset positions with seven creditworthy financial institutions.\nForeign Currency Risk Management\nWe manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates using forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts. Refer to Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of the notional amounts and fair values of our outstanding forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts, as well as the impact on earnings and other comprehensive income of such instruments for the fiscal periods presented.\nForward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts\nWe enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions made in an entity's non-functional currency, the settlement of foreign currency-denominated balances, and the translation of certain foreign operations' net assets into U.S. Dollars. As part of our overall strategy for managing the level of exposure to such exchange rate risk, relating primarily to the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi, we generally hedge a portion of our related exposures anticipated over the next twelve months using forward foreign currency exchange contracts with maturities of two months to one year to provide continuing coverage over the period of the respective exposure.\nOur foreign exchange risk management activities are governed by established policies and procedures. These policies and procedures provide a framework that allows for the management of currency exposures while ensuring the activities are conducted within our established guidelines. Our policies include guidelines for the organizational structure of our risk management function and for internal controls over foreign exchange risk management activities, including, but not limited to, authorization levels, transaction limits, and credit quality controls, as well as various measurements for monitoring compliance. We monitor foreign exchange risk using different techniques, including periodic review of market values and performance of sensitivity analyses.\nOur forward foreign currency exchange contracts are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. To the extent such contracts are designated as qualifying cash flow hedges of inventory transactions, related gains or losses are initially deferred in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") and are subsequently recognized within cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of operations when the related inventory is sold.\nCross-Currency Swap Contracts\nWe periodically designate (i) pay-floating rate, receive-floating rate cross-currency swap contracts or (ii) pay-fixed rate, receive fixed-rate cross-currency swap contracts as hedges of our net investment in certain European subsidiaries.\nOur pay-floating rate, receive-floating rate cross-currency swap contracts swap U.S. Dollar-denominated variable interest rate payments based on the contract's notional amount and 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") plus a fixed spread (as paid under a corresponding interest rate swap contract discussed below) for Euro-denominated variable interest rate payments based on 3-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\"EURIBOR\") plus a fixed spread, which, in combination with a corresponding interest rate swap contract, economically converts a portion of our fixed-rate U.S. Dollar-denominated senior note obligations to floating-rate Euro-denominated obligations.\nOur pay-fixed rate, receive-fixed rate cross-currency swap contracts swap U.S. Dollar-denominated fixed interest rate payments based on the contract's notional amount and the fixed rate of interest payable on certain of our senior notes for Euro-denominated fixed interest rate payments, thereby economically converting a portion of our fixed-rate U.S. Dollar-denominated senior note obligations to fixed rate Euro-denominated obligations.\nSensitivity\nWe perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts. In doing so, we assess the risk of loss in the fair values of these contracts that would result from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This analysis assumes a like movement by the foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio against the U.S. Dollar. As of March 27, 2021, a 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies under contract would result in a net increase or decrease, respectively, in the fair value of our derivative portfolio of approximately $109 million. This hypothetical net change in fair value should ultimately be largely offset by the net change in the related underlying hedged items.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nWe periodically designate pay-floating rate, receive-fixed rate interest rate swap contracts as hedges against changes in the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate debt attributed to changes in a benchmark interest rate. To the extent of their notional amount, such contracts effectively swap the fixed interest rate on certain of our fixed-rate senior notes for a variable interest rate based on 3-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread.\nSensitivity\nAs of March 27, 2021, we had no variable-rate debt outstanding. As such, our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily relates to changes in the fair values of our fixed-rate Senior Notes. As of March 27, 2021, the aggregate fair values of our Senior Notes were $1.731 billion. A 25-basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase, respectively, the aggregate fair values of our Senior Notes by approximately $22 million based on certain simplifying assumptions, including an immediate across-the-board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period. Such potential increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt would only be realized if we were to retire all or a portion of the debt prior to its maturity.\nInvestment Risk Management\nAs of March 27, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents on-hand of $2.579 billion, consisting of deposits in interest bearing accounts, investments in money market deposit accounts, and investments in time deposits with original maturities of 90 days or less. Our other significant investments included $197.5 million of short-term investments, consisting of investments in time deposits with original maturities greater than 90 days; and $9.0 million of restricted cash held in escrow with certain banks as collateral, primarily to secure guarantees in connection with certain international tax matters and real estate leases.\nWe actively monitor our exposure to changes in the fair value of our global investment portfolio in accordance with our established policies and procedures, which include monitoring both general and issuer-specific economic conditions, as discussed in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, diversification to minimize liquidity and credit risk, and achievement of maximum returns within the guidelines set forth in our investment policy. See Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further detail of the composition of our investment portfolio as of March 27, 2021.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAn accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, assessments of probability, and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same set of facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. We believe that the following list represents our critical accounting policies. For a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies, see Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nSales Reserves and Uncollectible Accounts\nA significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue involves estimating sales reserves, which represent the portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized. In particular, gross revenue related to our wholesale business is reduced by estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances. Gross revenue related to our retail business, including digital commerce sales, is also reduced by an estimate of returns.\nIn developing estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and cooperative advertising allowances, we analyze historical trends, actual and forecasted seasonal results, current economic and market conditions, retailer performance, and, in certain cases, contractual terms. Estimates for operational chargebacks are based on actual customer notifications of order fulfillment discrepancies and historical trends. We review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis. Our historical estimates of these amounts have not differed materially from actual results. However, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions, such as those resulting from widespread pandemic diseases and/or other catastrophic events, could result in our actual results differing materially from our estimates. A hypothetical 1% increase in our reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances as of March 27, 2021 would have reduced our Fiscal 2021 net revenues by approximately $2 million.\nSimilarly, we evaluate our accounts receivable balances to develop expectations regarding the extent to which they will ultimately be collected. Significant judgment and estimation are involved in this evaluation, including a receivables aging analysis which shows, by aged category, the percentage of receivables that has historically gone uncollected, an analysis of specific risks on a customer-by-customer basis for larger accounts (including consideration of their financial condition and ability to withstand potential prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions), and an evaluation of current and forecasted economic and market conditions over the respective asset's contractual life. Based on this information, we record an allowance\nfor estimated amounts that we ultimately expect not to collect due to credit. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for these risks as part of our allowance for doubtful accounts, a severe and prolonged adverse impact on our major customers' business and operations beyond those forecasted could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net revenues, cash flows, and/or financial condition. A hypothetical 1% increase in the level of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 27, 2021 would have increased our Fiscal 2021 SG&A expenses by less than $1 million.\nSee \"Accounts Receivable\" in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in our sales reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts for each of the three fiscal years presented.\nInventories\nWe hold retail inventory that is sold in our own stores and digital commerce sites directly to consumers. We also hold inventory that is sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores and specialty retail stores. Substantially all of our inventories are comprised of finished goods, which are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value, with cost determined on a weighted-average cost basis.\nThe estimated net realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of our individual product lines, the impact of market trends and economic conditions (including those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events), and a forecast of future demand, giving consideration to the value of current orders in-house for future sales of inventory, as well as plans to sell inventory through our factory stores, among other liquidation channels. Actual results may differ from estimates due to the quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences, and economic and market conditions. Reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts. Our historical estimates of these costs and the related provisions have not differed materially from actual results. However, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions could result in our actual results differing materially from our estimates.\nA hypothetical 1% increase in the level of our inventory reserves as of March 27, 2021 would have decreased our Fiscal 2021 gross profit by approximately $3 million.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable.\nWe generally perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value. However, in order to reassess the fair values of our reporting units, we periodically perform a quantitative impairment analysis in lieu of using the qualitative approach.\nPerformance of the qualitative goodwill impairment assessment requires judgment in identifying and considering the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that affect the fair values of our reporting units. This requires consideration and assessment of external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as our actual and planned financial performance. We also give consideration to the difference between each reporting unit's fair value and carrying value as of the most recent date that a fair value measurement was performed. If the results of the qualitative assessment conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, additional quantitative impairment testing is performed.\nThe quantitative goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the reporting unit's goodwill is considered not to be impaired. However, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. Any impairment charge recognized is limited to the amount of the respective reporting unit's allocated goodwill.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit under the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including an assessment of external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as actual and planned financial\nperformance. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used when determining the fair values of other indefinite-lived intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. To assist management in the process of determining any potential goodwill impairment, we may review and consider appraisals from accredited independent valuation firms. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons, and recent transactions. These approaches involve significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in those future cash flows, perpetual growth rates, and selection of appropriate market comparable metrics and transactions.\nWe performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of the beginning of the second quarter of Fiscal 2021 using the qualitative approach discussed above. In performing the assessment, we considered the results of our most recent quantitative goodwill impairment test, which was performed as of the end of Fiscal 2020 and incorporated assumptions related to COVID-19 business disruptions, the results of which indicated that the fair values of our reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. Based on the results of the qualitative impairment assessment performed, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment. No goodwill impairment charges were recorded during any of the fiscal years presented. See Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIn evaluating finite-lived intangible assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition where probable. If such estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that such asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, as estimated considering external market participant assumptions.\nIt is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment or recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if, for example, (i) our businesses do not perform as projected, (ii) overall economic conditions in future years vary from current assumptions, (iii) business conditions or strategies change from our current assumptions, or (iv) the identification of our reporting units change, among other factors. Such changes could result in a future impairment charge of goodwill or other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nImpairment of Other Long-Lived Assets\nProperty and equipment and lease-related right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset (including any potential sublease income for lease-related ROU assets) and its eventual disposition, where applicable. If such estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that such asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, as estimated considering external market participant assumptions and discounted cash flows, including those based on estimated market rents for lease-related ROU assets. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal (commonly referred to as assets held-for-sale) are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.\nIn determining future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost controls, the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local advertising. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, future impairments may arise in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations. For example, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions could negatively impact consumer behavior, spending levels, and/or shopping preferences and result in actual results differing from our estimates. Additionally, we may review and consider appraisals from accredited independent valuation firms to determine the fair value of long-lived assets, where applicable.\nDuring Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020, and Fiscal 2019, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $96.0 million, $38.7 million, and $21.2 million, respectively, to write-down the carrying values of certain long-lived assets based upon their assumed fair values. Additionally, during Fiscal 2019, we recorded a non-cash charge of $4.6 million to reduce the carrying value of our corporate jet being held-for-sale to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nIn determining our income tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions. If we believe that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the tax benefit. We measure the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These assessments can be complex and require significant judgment, and we often obtain assistance from external advisors. To the extent that our estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. If the initial assessment of a position fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, we will recognize the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating losses, capital losses, general business credit carryforwards, and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. Valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, which typically involves the use of significant estimates. Such allowances are adjusted as events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments to those balances.\nSee Note 10 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes.\nContingencies\nWe are periodically exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including potential losses relating to certain litigation, alleged information system security breaches, contractual disputes, employee relation matters, various tax or other governmental audits, and trademark and intellectual property matters and disputes. We record a liability for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of such loss is reasonably estimable. In addition, if it is considered reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could exceed any established liability, we disclose the estimated impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, if practicable. Management considers many factors in making these assessments. As the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and governmental actions. As a result, the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on management's judgment in developing the related estimates and assumptions.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe expense all stock-based compensation awarded to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for forfeitures which are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience and expected future trends.\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units (\"RSUs\")\nWe have granted restricted shares of our Class A common stock to our non-employee directors and grant service-based RSUs to certain of our senior executives and other employees, as well as to our non-employee directors. In addition, we grant RSUs with performance-based and market-based vesting conditions to such senior executives and other key employees.\nThe fair values of our restricted stock, service-based RSU, and performance-based RSU awards are measured based on the fair value of our Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and unvested. Related compensation expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized over the employees' requisite service period, to the extent that our attainment of performance goals (upon which vesting is dependent) is deemed probable, and involves judgment as to expectations surrounding our achievement of certain defined operating performance metrics.\nThe fair value of our market-based RSU awards, for which vesting is dependent upon total shareholder return (\"TSR\") of our Class A common stock over a three-year performance period relative to that of a pre-established peer group, is measured on the grant date based on estimated projections of our relative TSR over the performance period. These estimates are made using a Monte Carlo simulation, which models multiple stock price paths of our Class A common stock and that of the peer group to evaluate and determine our ultimate expected relative TSR performance ranking. Related compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately satisfied. See Note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nStock Options\nStock options have been granted to employees and non-employee directors with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the date of grant. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options, which requires the use of both subjective and objective assumptions. Certain key assumptions involve estimating future uncertain events. The key factors influencing the estimation process include the expected term of the option, expected volatility of our stock price, our expected dividend yield, and the risk-free interest rate, among others. Generally, once stock option values are determined, accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual results.\nNo stock options were granted during any of the fiscal years presented. See Note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nSensitivity\nThe assumptions used in calculating the grant date fair values of our stock-based compensation awards represent our best estimates. In addition, projecting the achievement level of certain performance-based awards, as well as estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited, requires judgment. If actual results or forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions, or if assumptions used to estimate the grant date fair value of future stock-based award grants are significantly changed, stock-based compensation expense and, therefore, our results of operations could be materially impacted. A hypothetical 10% change in our Fiscal 2021 stock-based compensation expense would have affected our net loss by approximately $6 million.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of certain recently issued accounting standards which have impacted our consolidated financial statements or may impact our consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods."

    "text": "(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nWe have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level, as of the fiscal year-end covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of the Company's assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Further, the evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was made as of a specific date, and continued effectiveness in future periods is subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may decline.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this report based on the framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company's internal controls over financial reporting were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the fiscal year-end covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nErnst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting as included elsewhere herein.\n(c) Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nAlthough there have been no material changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting, we have experienced varying degrees of business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including periods of closure of our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities, as described within Item 1 —\n\"Business\n—\nRecent Developments,\"\nwith a significant portion of our corporate employees working remotely throughout Fiscal 2021. Our Board of Directors has also approved a restructuring plan, as described within Item 1 —\n\"Business\n—\nRecent Developments,\"\nwhich has resulted in a significant reduction to our global workforce during the second half of Fiscal 2021. Despite such cumulative actions, we have not experienced any material changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. We will continue to evaluate and monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and our restructuring activities on our internal controls. See Item 1A —\n\"Risk\nFactors\n—\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions — Infectious disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business\"\nand\n\"Risk Factors\n—\nRisks Related to our Strategic Initiatives and Restructuring Activities — We may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from our restructuring plans\"\nfor additional discussion regarding risks to our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and our restructuring plans, respectively."

RLC's long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across an expanding number of products, brands, sales channels, and international markets. RLC's brand names include Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Collection, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Polo Ralph Lauren, Double RL, Lauren Ralph Lauren, Polo Ralph Lauren Children, Chaps, and Club Monaco, among others. RLC and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to herein as the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" and \"ourselves,\" unless the context indicates otherwise.\nThe Company diversifies its business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail, wholesale, and licensing). This allows the Company to maintain a dynamic balance as its operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or channel of distribution. The Company sells directly to consumers through its integrated retail channel, which includes its retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. The Company's wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which the Company has licensed the right to operate in defined geographic territories using its trademarks. In addition, the Company licenses to third parties for specified periods the right to access its various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.\nThe Company organizes its business into the following\nthree\nreportable segments: North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to these reportable segments, the Company also has other non-reportable segments. See Note 20 for further discussion of the Company's segment reporting structure.\n2.\nBasis of Presentation\nBasis of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\") and present the consolidated financial position, income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows of the Company, including all entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest and is determined to be the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nFiscal Year\nThe Company utilizes a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday immediately before or after March 31. As such, fiscal year 2021 ended on March 27, 2021 and was a 52-week period (\"Fiscal 2021\"); fiscal year 2020 ended on March 28, 2020 and was a 52-week period (\"Fiscal 2020\"); fiscal year 2019 ended on March 30, 2019 and was a 52-week period (\"Fiscal 2019\"); and fiscal year 2022 will end on April 2, 2022 and will be a 53-week period (\"Fiscal 2022\").\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes thereto. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nSignificant estimates inherent in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include reserves for bad debt, customer returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances; the realizability of inventory; reserves for litigation and other contingencies; useful lives and impairments of long-lived tangible and intangible assets; fair value measurements; accounting for income taxes and related uncertain tax positions; valuation of stock-based compensation awards and related forfeiture rates; and reserves for restructuring activity, among others.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods' financial information in order to conform to the current period's presentation.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nBeginning in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus commonly referred to as COVID-19 emerged and spread rapidly across the globe, including throughout all major geographies in which the Company operates (North America, Europe, and Asia), resulting in adverse economic conditions and business disruptions, as well as significant volatility in global financial markets. Governments worldwide have imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as temporary travel bans, forced business closures, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. Such factors, among others, have resulted in a significant decline in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items. Additionally, during this period of uncertainty, companies across a wide array of industries have implemented various initiatives to reduce operating expenses and preserve cash balances, including work furloughs, reduced pay, and severance actions, which could lower consumers' disposable income levels or willingness to purchase discretionary items. Further, even after such government restrictions and company initiatives are lifted, consumer behavior, spending levels, and/or shopping preferences, such as willingness to congregate in indoor shopping centers or other populated locations, could be adversely affected.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has experienced varying degrees of business disruptions and periods of closure of its stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities, as have the Company's wholesale customers, licensing partners, suppliers, and vendors. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2021, the majority of the Company's stores in key markets were closed for an average of 8 to 10 weeks due to government-mandated lockdowns and other restrictions, resulting in significant adverse impacts to its operating results. Resurgences in certain parts of the world resulted in further business disruptions periodically throughout Fiscal 2021, most notably in Europe where a significant number of the Company's stores were closed for approximately two to three months during the second half of Fiscal 2021, including during the holiday period, due to government-mandated lockdowns and other restrictions. Such disruptions have continued into the first quarter of Fiscal 2022, impacting not only the Company's businesses in Europe but also in other regions of the world (notably the Company's retail operations in Japan and its sourcing operations in India). Further, the majority of the Company's stores that are able to remain open have periodically been subject to limited operating hours and/or customer capacity levels in accordance with local health guidelines, with traffic remaining challenged. The Company's wholesale and licensing businesses have also been adversely affected, particularly in North America and Europe, as a result of store closures and lower traffic and consumer demand.\nThroughout the pandemic, the Company's priority has been to ensure the safety and well-being of its employees, customers, and the communities in which it operates around the world. The Company continues to consider the guidance of local governments and global health organizations and has implemented new health and safety protocols in its stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities. The Company has also taken various preemptive actions to preserve cash and strengthen its liquidity position, including:\n•\namending its Global Credit Facility in May 2020 to temporarily waive its leverage ratio requirement (see Note 11);\n•\nissuing $\n1.250\nbillion of unsecured senior notes in June 2020, the proceeds of which are being used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of certain of the Company's previously outstanding borrowings (see Note 11);\n•\ntemporarily suspending its quarterly cash dividend and common stock repurchase program, effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 (see Note 16);\n•\ntemporarily reducing the base compensation of its executives and senior management team, as well as its Board of Directors, for the first quarter of Fiscal 2021;\n•\nfurloughing or reducing work hours for a significant portion of its employees during the first half of Fiscal 2021;\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n•\ncarefully managing its expense structure across all key areas of spend, including aligning inventory levels with anticipated demand, negotiating rent abatements with certain of its landlords, and postponing non-critical capital build-out and other investments and activities;\n•\npursuing relevant government subsidy programs related to COVID-19 business disruptions; and\n•\nimproving upon its cash conversion cycle largely driven by its accounts receivable collection efforts and extended vendor payment terms.\nDespite the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, the pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict for how long and to what extent the pandemic will impact its business operations or the global economy as a whole. The Company will continue to assess its operations location-by-location, considering the guidance of local governments and global health organizations to determine when its operations can begin returning to normal levels of business.\n3.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue across all channels of the business when it satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of promised products or services to its customers, which occurs either at a point in time or over time, depending on when the customer obtains the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the products or services. The amount of revenue recognized considers terms of sale that create variability in the amount of consideration that the Company ultimately expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products or services, and is subject to an overall constraint that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods. Sales and other related taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenue.\nRevenue from the Company's retail business is recognized when the customer takes physical possession of the products, which occurs either at the point of sale for merchandise purchased at the Company's own retail stores and shop-within-shop locations, or upon receipt of shipment for merchandise ordered through direct-to-consumer digital commerce sites. Such revenues are recorded net of estimated returns based on historical trends. Payment is due at the point of sale.\nGift cards purchased by customers are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed for products sold by the Company's retail business, at which point revenue is recognized. The Company also estimates and recognizes revenue for gift card balances not expected to ever be redeemed (referred to as \"breakage\") to the extent that it does not have a legal obligation to remit the value of such unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property. Such estimates are based upon historical redemption trends, with breakage income recognized in proportion to the pattern of actual customer redemptions.\nRevenue from the Company's wholesale business is generally recognized upon shipment of products, at which point title passes and risk of loss is transferred to the customer. In certain arrangements where the Company retains the risk of loss during shipment, revenue is recognized upon receipt of products by the customer. Wholesale revenue is recorded net of estimates of returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances. Returns and allowances require pre-approval from management and discounts are based on trade terms. Estimates for end-of-season markdown reserves are based on historical trends, actual and forecasted seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic and market conditions, retailer performance, and, in certain cases, contractual terms. Estimates for operational chargebacks are based on actual customer notifications of order fulfillment discrepancies and historical trends. The Company reviews and refines these estimates on at least a quarterly basis. The Company's historical estimates of these amounts have not differed materially from actual results.\nRevenue from the Company's licensing arrangements is recognized over time during the period that licensees are provided access to the Company's trademarks (i.e., symbolic intellectual property) and benefit from such access through their own sales of licensed products. These arrangements require licensees to pay a sales-based royalty, which for most arrangements may be subject to a contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount. Payments are generally due quarterly and, depending on time of receipt, may be recorded as a liability until recognized as revenue. The Company recognizes revenue for sales-based royalty arrangements (including those for which the royalty exceeds any contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amount) as licensed products are sold by the licensee. If a sales-based royalty is not ultimately expected to exceed a contractually-\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nguaranteed minimum royalty amount, the minimum is generally recognized as revenue ratably over the respective contractual period. This sales-based output measure of progress and pattern of recognition best represents the value transferred to the licensee over the term of the arrangement, as well as the amount of consideration that the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for providing access to its trademarks.\nAs of March 27, 2021, contractually-guaranteed minimum royalty amounts expected to be recognized as revenue during future periods were as follows:\n(a)\nAmounts presented do not contemplate potential contract renewals or royalties earned in excess of the contractually-guaranteed minimums.\nDisaggregated Net Revenues\nThe following tables disaggregate the Company's net revenues into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors for the fiscal periods presented:\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(a)\nNet revenues from the Company's retail and wholesale businesses are recognized at a point in time. Net revenues from the Company's licensing business are recognized over time.\nDeferred Income\nDeferred income represents cash payments received in advance of the Company's transfer of control of products or services to its customers and generally consists of unredeemed gift cards (net of breakage) and advance royalty payments from licensees.\nThe Company's deferred income balances were $\n12.1\nmillion and $\n14.6\nmillion as of March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively, and were primarily recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets. During Fiscal 2021, the Company recognized $\n10.0\nmillion of net revenues from amounts recorded as deferred income as of March 28, 2020. The majority of the deferred income balance as of March 27, 2021 is expected to be recognized as revenue within the next twelve months.\nCost of Goods Sold and Selling Expenses\nCost of goods sold includes the amounts incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale to the Company's customers, including product costs, freight-in, and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory realizability. Gains and losses associated with forward foreign currency exchange contracts that are designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of inventory transactions are also recognized within cost of goods sold when the hedged inventory is sold. The costs of selling merchandise, including those associated with preparing merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing, warehousing, and order charges (\"handling costs\"), are included in selling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nCosts associated with shipping goods to customers are accounted for as fulfillment activities and reflected as SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Shipping and handling costs (described above) billed to customers are included in revenue.\nA summary of shipping and handling costs recognized during the fiscal periods presented is as follows:\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nAdvertising and Marketing Costs\nAdvertising costs, including the costs to produce advertising, are expensed when the advertisement is first exhibited. Advertising costs paid to wholesale customers under cooperative advertising programs are not included in advertising costs, but rather are reflected as a reduction of revenue since generally the benefits are not sufficiently separable from the purchases of the Company's products by customers. Costs associated with the marketing and promotion of the Company's products are included within SG&A expenses.\nAdvertising and marketing expenses were $\n265.0\nmillion, $\n278.0\nmillion, and $\n272.8\nmillion in Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020, and Fiscal 2019, respectively. Deferred advertising, marketing, and promotional costs, which principally relate to advertisements that have not yet been exhibited or payments made for services that have not yet been received, were $\n9.5\nmillion and $\n10.1\nmillion at the end of Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively, and were recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\nThe financial position and operating results of the Company's foreign operations are accounted for in their respective functional currencies, which are generally consistent with the local currency. For purposes of consolidation, local currency assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. Dollars at the spot rates of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date, and local currency revenues and expenses are translated to U.S. Dollars at average rates of exchange in effect during the period. The resulting translation gains or losses are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) (\"OCI\") and in the consolidated statements of equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (\"AOCI\"). Gains and losses on the translation of intercompany loans made to foreign subsidiaries that are of a long-term investment nature are also included within this component of equity.\nThe Company also recognizes gains and losses on both third-party and intercompany balances that are denominated in a currency other than the respective entity's functional currency. Such foreign currency transactional gains and losses are recognized within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations, inclusive of the effects of any related hedging activities, and reflected net gains of $\n8.7\nmillion in Fiscal 2021 and net losses of $\n1.1\nmillion and $\n2.8\nmillion in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss), which is reported in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and consolidated statements of equity, consists of net income (loss) and certain other gains and losses affecting equity that, under U.S. GAAP, are excluded from net income (loss) and referred to as OCI. Components of OCI consist of foreign currency translation gains (losses); net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges, such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts; net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments; and net realized and unrealized gains (losses) related to the Company's defined benefit plans.\nNet Income (Loss) per Common Share\nBasic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Weighted-average common shares include shares of the Company's Class A and Class B common stock. Diluted net income (loss) per common share adjusts basic net income (loss) per common share for the dilutive effects of outstanding restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), stock options, and any other potentially dilutive instruments, only in the periods in which such effects are dilutive.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate basic net income (loss) per common share is reconciled to shares used to calculate diluted net income (loss) per common share as follows:\n(a)\nIncremental shares of\n1.2\nmillion attributable to outstanding RSUs were excluded from the computation of diluted shares for Fiscal 2021 as such shares would not be dilutive given the net loss incurred during the fiscal year.\nAll earnings per share amounts have been calculated using unrounded numbers.\nThe Company has outstanding performance-based RSUs, which are included in the computation of diluted shares only to the extent that the underlying performance conditions (i) have been satisfied as of the end of the reporting period or (ii) would be considered satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the end of the related contingency period and the result would be dilutive. In addition, options to purchase shares of the Company's Class A common stock at an exercise price greater than the average market price of such common stock during the reporting period are anti-dilutive and therefore not included in the computation of diluted net income (loss) per common share.\nAs of the end of Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020, and Fiscal 2019, there were\n0.4\nmillion,\n0.8\nmillion, and\n1.4\nmillion, respectively, of additional shares issuable contingent upon vesting of performance-based RSUs and upon exercise of anti-dilutive stock options that were excluded from the diluted shares calculations.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes expense for all stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for forfeitures which are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience and expected future trends. The grant date fair values of restricted stock awards, service-based RSUs, and performance-based RSUs are determined based on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and unvested. The grant date fair value of the Company's market-based RSU awards, for which vesting is dependent upon total shareholder return (\"TSR\") of its Class A common stock over a three-year performance period relative to that of a pre-established peer group, is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the grant date fair value of any stock option awards.\nCompensation expense for all performance-based RSUs is recognized over the requisite service period when attainment of the performance goal is deemed probable, net of estimated forfeitures. Compensation expense for market-based RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the requisite service period regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately satisfied. The Company recognizes compensation expense on an accelerated basis for all awards with graded vesting terms, including restricted stock, certain RSUs, and stock options. For RSU awards with cliff vesting terms, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis. For certain RSU awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who will become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, the related compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis over a term commensurate with the period that the employee is required to provide service in order to vest in the award. See Note 18 for further discussion of the Company's stock-based compensation plans.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less, including investments in time deposits and debt securities. Investments in debt securities are diversified across high-credit quality issuers in accordance with the Company's risk-management policies.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nRestricted Cash\nThe Company is periodically required to place cash in escrow with various banks as collateral, primarily to secure guarantees of corresponding amounts made by the banks to international tax authorities on behalf of the Company, such as to secure refunds of value-added tax payments in certain international tax jurisdictions or in the case of certain international tax audits, as well as to secure guarantees related to certain real estate leases. Such cash is classified as restricted cash and reported as a component of either prepaid expenses and other current assets or other non-current assets in the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nInvestments\nThe Company's investment objectives include capital preservation, maintaining adequate liquidity, diversification to minimize liquidity and credit risk, and achievement of maximum returns within the guidelines set forth in the Company's investment policy.\nShort-term investments consist of investments which the Company expects to convert into cash within one year, including any time deposits and debt securities with original maturities greater than 90 days. Non-current investments, which are classified within other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets, consist of time deposits and debt securities which the Company does not expect to convert into cash within one year. See Note 13 for further information relating to the composition of the Company's investments.\nThe Company classifies such investments as available-for-sale. Accordingly, they are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses generally recognized as a component of AOCI in the consolidated balance sheets, and related realized gains or losses (or unrealized credit-related impairment losses, if any) recorded within other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. Cash inflows and outflows related to the sale and purchase of investments are classified as investing activities in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows.\nEquity-method Investments\nOwnership interests that provide the Company with significant influence, but less than a controlling interest, over an investee are generally accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Significant influence is generally presumed to exist when the Company owns between 20% and 50% of the investee's common stock.\nUnder the equity method of accounting, the following amounts are generally recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements: the Company's original investment, as subsequently adjusted for its share of the investee's earnings (losses) and reduced by any dividends received and other-than-temporary impairments recorded, is included in the consolidated balance sheets; the Company's share of the investee's periodic earnings (losses) is included in the consolidated statements of operations; and dividends and other cash distributions received from the investee and additional cash investments made in or other cash paid to the investee are included in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe Company's share of equity-method investee earnings and losses is recognized within other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations, and reflected a net loss in Fiscal 2021 of $\n0.1\nmillion and net gains of $\n0.1\nmillion and $\n2.9\nmillion in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively.\nImpairment Assessment\nThe Company evaluates the need to recognize impairment charges for its investments that are in unrealized loss positions, if any, and its equity method investments on a quarterly basis (see Note 12). Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers or investees. Factors considered by the Company include (i) the financial condition, creditworthiness, and near-term prospects of the issuer or investee; (ii) future economic conditions and market forecasts; (iii) the length of time to maturity, if applicable, and an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell its investment before recovery of market value; and (iv) whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the investment's carrying amount might not be recoverable.\nDuring Fiscal 2020, the Company recorded a $\n7.1\nmillion impairment charge within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations related to an equity method investment (see Note 8).\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nAccounts Receivable\nIn the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to wholesale customers that satisfy defined credit criteria. Payment is generally due within\n30 to 120 days\nand does not include a significant financing component. Accounts receivable is recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and is presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheets net of certain reserves and allowances. These reserves and allowances consist of (i) reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances (see the \"\nRevenue Recognition\n\" section above for further discussion of related accounting policies) and (ii) allowances for doubtful accounts.\nA rollforward of the activity in the Company's reserves for returns, discounts, end-of-season markdowns, operational chargebacks, and certain cooperative advertising allowances is presented as follows:\nAn allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of accounts receivable aging, assessments of collectability based on evaluation of historical trends, the financial condition of the Company's customers and their ability to withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions, and evaluation of the impact of current and forecasted economic and market conditions over the related asset's contractual life, among other factors.\nThe Company's allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 reflects estimated impacts associated with COVID-19 business disruptions, which include declines in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items.\nA rollforward of the activity in the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts is presented below:\n(a)\nAmounts recorded to bad debt expense are included within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company sells its wholesale merchandise primarily to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, and extends credit based on an evaluation of each customer's financial capacity and condition, usually without requiring collateral. In the Company's wholesale business, concentration of credit risk is relatively limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas. However, the Company has\nthree\nkey wholesale customers that generate significant sales volume. During Fiscal 2021, the Company's sales to its\nthree\nlargest wholesale customers accounted for approximately\n14\n% of total net revenues. Substantially all of the Company's sales to its\nthree\nlargest wholesale customers related to its North America segment. As of March 27, 2021, these\nthree\nkey wholesale customers accounted for approximately\n30\n% of total gross accounts receivable.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nInventories\nThe Company holds inventory that is sold in its retail stores and digital commerce sites directly to consumers. The Company also holds inventory that is to be sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners. Substantially all of the Company's inventories consist of finished goods, which are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value, with cost determined on a weighted-average cost basis.\nThe estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of the Company's individual product lines, the impact of market trends and economic conditions (such as those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events), and a forecast of future demand, giving consideration to the value of current in-house orders for future sales of inventory, as well as plans to sell inventory through the Company's factory stores, among other liquidation channels. Actual results may differ from estimates due to the quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences, and actual economic and market conditions. In addition, reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts. The Company's historical estimates of the realizable value of its inventory and its reserves for inventory shrinkage have not differed materially from actual results. However, unforeseen adverse future economic and market conditions could result in the Company's actual results differing materially from its estimates.\nThe Company's estimated realizable value of its inventory reflects adverse impacts associated with COVID-19 business disruptions, which include temporary closures of the Company's stores and those of its wholesale customers worldwide, as well as declines in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items.\nImplementation Costs Incurred in Cloud Computing Arrangements\nFor cloud computing arrangements that are a service contract, the Company capitalizes certain implementation costs incurred (depending on their nature) during the application development stage of the related project, and expenses costs during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages as they are incurred. Capitalized implementation costs are expensed on a straight-line basis over the reasonably certain term of the hosting arrangement, beginning when the module is ready for its intended use. The Company's cloud computing arrangements relate to various areas, including certain retail store and digital commerce operations, and corporate and administrative functions. Capitalized amounts related to such arrangements are recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets and within other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 7).\nCapitalized implementation costs expensed were $\n8.4\nmillion and $\n4.3\nmillion during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively, and were recorded in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company did not incur any capitalized implementation costs during Fiscal 2019.\nSee Note 4 for discussion of the Company's adoption of a new accounting standard related to implementation costs incurred in connection with cloud computing arrangements that are a service contract as of the beginning of Fiscal 2021.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis, based upon the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets, which range from\nthree\nto\nseven years\nfor furniture and fixtures, machinery and equipment, and capitalized software; and from\nten\nto\nforty years\nfor buildings and improvements. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the respective assets or the term of the related lease.\nProperty and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable (see Note 12). In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, including finite-lived intangibles as described below, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from its use of the asset and its eventual disposition, where applicable. If such estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that such asset's carrying value exceeds its fair value, as estimated considering external market participant assumptions and discounted cash flows. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal (commonly referred to as assets held-for-sale) are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nLeases\nThe Company's lease arrangements primarily relate to real estate, including its retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, corporate offices, and warehouse facilities and, to a lesser extent, certain equipment and other assets. The Company's leases generally have initial terms ranging from\nthree\nto\nfifteen years\nand may include renewal or early-termination options, rent escalation clauses, and/or lease incentives in the form of construction allowances and rent abatements. The Company is typically required to make fixed minimum rent payments, variable rent payments based on performance (e.g., percentage-of-sales-based payments), or a combination thereof, relating to its right to use an underlying leased asset. The Company is also often required to pay for certain other costs that do not relate specifically to its right to use an underlying leased asset, but that are associated with the asset, including real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance fees, and/or certain other costs (referred to collectively herein as \"non-lease components\"), which may be fixed or variable in amount, depending on the terms of the respective lease agreement. The Company's leases do not contain significantly restrictive covenants or residual value guarantees.\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at the arrangement's inception. If a lease is determined to exist, its related term is assessed at the lease commencement date, once the underlying asset is made available by the lessor for the Company's use. The Company's assessment of the lease term reflects the non-cancellable period of the lease, inclusive of any rent-free periods, plus any periods covered by early-termination options for which the Company is not considered reasonably certain of exercising, as well as periods covered by renewal options for which it is considered reasonably certain of exercising. The Company also determines lease classification as either\noperating\nor\nfinance\nat lease commencement, which governs the pattern of expense recognition and the presentation thereof in the consolidated statements of operations over the lease term.\nFor leases with a lease term exceeding 12 months, a liability is recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet at the lease commencement date reflecting the present value of its related fixed payment obligations over such term. A corresponding right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset equal to the initial lease liability is also recorded, increased by any prepaid rent and/or initial direct costs incurred in connection with execution of the lease, and reduced by any incentives provided by the lessor. The Company also includes fixed payment obligations related to non-lease components in the measurement of its ROU assets and lease liabilities, given its election to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single lease component. Variable lease payments are not included in the measurement of ROU assets and lease liabilities. ROU assets associated with finance leases are presented separately from those associated with operating leases, and are included within property and equipment, net on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. For purposes of measuring the present value of its fixed payment obligations for a given lease, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, determined based on information available at lease commencement, given that rates implicit in its leasing arrangements are not readily determinable. The Company's incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate it would pay to borrow on a secured basis an amount equal to the lease payments and incorporates the term and economic environment of the lease.\nFor operating leases, fixed lease payments are recognized as operating lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, the initial ROU asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term, along with recognition of interest expense associated with accretion of the remaining lease liability, which is ultimately reduced by the related fixed payments as they are made. For leases with a lease term of 12 months or less (referred to as a \"short-term lease\"), any fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over such term and are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet. For all leases, variable lease cost, if any, is recognized as incurred.\nROU assets, along with any related long-lived assets, are periodically evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable (see Note 12). To the extent that such assets are ultimately determined to be impaired, they are written down accordingly on a relative carrying amount basis, with the ROU asset written down to an amount no lower than its estimated fair value. Subsequent to the recognition of any such impairment, total remaining lease cost is recognized on a front-loaded basis over the remaining lease term.\nSee Note 14 for further discussion of the Company's leases.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nAt acquisition, the Company estimates and records the fair value of purchased intangible assets, which typically consist of reacquired license agreements, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and/or order backlog. The fair values of these intangible assets are estimated based on management's assessment, considering independent third-party appraisals when\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nnecessary. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired, both tangible and intangible, is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually. The Company generally performs its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analyses using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of such assets are less than their respective carrying values. If, based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the asset exceeds its carrying value, a quantitative test is performed. Under the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess. The Company also periodically performs a quantitative test to assess its goodwill for impairment in lieu of using the qualitative approach in order to reassess the fair values of its reporting units.\nFinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long-lived assets as noted above, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be fully recoverable. See discussion of the Company's accounting policy for long-lived asset impairment as previously described under the caption \"\nProperty and Equipment, Net.\n\"\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided using the asset and liability method. Under this method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, current taxes payable/refunds receivable, and tax expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating losses, capital losses, general business credit carryforwards, and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The Company accounts for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates in the period of enactment.\nIn addition, valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur or circumstances change that warrant adjustments.\nIn determining the income tax benefit (provision) for financial reporting purposes, the Company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions. If the Company considers that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, it recognizes the tax benefit. The Company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These assessments can be complex and the Company often obtains assistance from external advisors. To the extent that the Company's estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax benefit (provision) in the period in which such determinations are made. If the initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, the Company regularly monitors its position and subsequently recognizes the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not; (ii) the statute of limitations expires; or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the Company expects to pay cash within the next twelve months. Interest and penalties are recorded within the income tax benefit (provision) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets together with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits.\nSee Note 10 for further discussion of the Company's income taxes\n.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company records derivative financial instruments on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting are either (i) offset through earnings against the changes in fair value of the related hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments or (ii) recognized in equity as a component of AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings, depending on whether the instrument is hedging against changes in fair value or cash flows and net investments, respectively.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nEach derivative instrument that qualifies for hedge accounting is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the risk associated with the related exposure. For each instrument that is designated as a hedge, the Company documents the related risk management objective and strategy, including identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, and the risk exposure, as well as how hedge effectiveness will be assessed over the instrument's term. To assess hedge effectiveness at the inception of a hedging relationship, the Company generally uses regression analysis, a statistical method, to evaluate how changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are expected to offset changes in the fair value or cash flows of the related hedged item. The extent to which a hedging instrument has been and is expected to remain highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows is assessed by the Company on at least a quarterly basis.\nGiven its use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to such contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate such counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon an evaluation of their credit ratings and certain other factors, adhering to established limits for credit exposure. The Company's established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk from derivative transactions include ongoing review and assessment of its counterparties' creditworthiness. The Company also enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties, when possible, to further mitigate credit risk. In the event of default or termination (as such terms are defined within the respective master netting arrangement), these arrangements allow the Company to net-settle amounts payable and receivable related to multiple derivative transactions with the same counterparty. The master netting arrangements specify a number of events of default and termination, including the failure to make timely payments.\nThe fair values of the Company's derivative instruments are recorded on its consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis. For cash flow reporting purposes, proceeds received or amounts paid upon the settlement of a derivative instrument are classified in the same manner as the related item being hedged, primarily within cash flows from operating activities for its forward foreign exchange contracts and within cash flows from investing activities for its cross-currency swap contracts, both as discussed below.\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate its risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions made in an entity's non-functional currency. To the extent designated as cash flow hedges, related gains or losses on such instruments are initially deferred in equity as a component of AOCI and are subsequently recognized within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations when the related inventory is sold.\nIf a derivative instrument is dedesignated or if hedge accounting is discontinued because the instrument is not expected to be highly effective in hedging the designated exposure, any further gains (losses) are recognized in earnings each period within other income (expense), net. Upon discontinuance of hedge accounting, the cumulative change in fair value of the derivative instrument recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the related hedged item affects earnings, consistent with the hedging strategy, unless the related forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring, in which case the accumulated amount is immediately recognized within other income (expense), net.\nHedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations\nThe Company periodically uses cross-currency swap contracts to reduce risk associated with exchange rate fluctuations on certain of its net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Changes in the fair values of such derivative instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in equity as a component of AOCI in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. In assessing the effectiveness of such hedges, the Company uses a method based on changes in spot rates to measure the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on both its foreign subsidiary net investment and the related hedging instrument. Under this method, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument other than those due to changes in the spot rate are initially recorded in AOCI as a translation adjustment and are amortized into earnings as interest expense using a systematic and rational method over the instrument's term. Changes in fair value associated with the effective portion (i.e., those due to changes in the spot rate) are recorded in AOCI as a translation adjustment and are released and recognized in earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of the hedged net investment.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nFair Value Hedges\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative instrument that is designated as a fair value hedge, along with offsetting changes in the fair value of the related hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in earnings. To the extent that the change in the fair value of the hedged item does not fully offset the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument, the resulting net impact is reflected in earnings within the income statement line item associated with the hedged item.\nUndesignated Hedges\nThe Company uses undesignated hedges primarily to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk related to third-party and intercompany balances and exposures. Changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative instruments are recognized in earnings each period within other income (expense), net.\nSee Note 13 for further discussion of the Company's derivative financial instruments\n.\n4.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nReference Rate Reform\nIn March 2020 and January 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2020-04, \"Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\" (\"ASU 2020-04\") and ASU No. 2021-01, \"Reference Rate Reform: Scope\" (\"ASU 2021-01\"), respectively. Together, ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions for the application of U.S. GAAP, if certain criteria are met, to contract modifications, hedging relationships, and other arrangements that are expected to be impacted by the global transition away from certain reference rates, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") and other interbank offered rates, towards new reference rates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"). The guidance in ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 was effective upon issuance and, once adopted, may be applied prospectively to contract modifications and hedging relationships through December 31, 2022. The Company is evaluating the impact that the guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, if adopted, and currently does not expect that it would be material.\nImplementation Costs Incurred in Cloud Computing Arrangements\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, \"Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract\" (\"ASU 2018-15\"). ASU 2018-15 addresses diversity in practice surrounding the accounting for costs incurred to implement a cloud computing hosting arrangement that is a service contract by establishing a model for capitalizing or expensing such costs, depending on their nature and the stage of the related project during which they are incurred. Any capitalized costs are to be expensed over the reasonably certain term of the hosting arrangement and presented in the same line within the statement of operations as the expense for the arrangement's fees. ASU 2018-15 also requires enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures surrounding hosting arrangements that are service contracts.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2018-15 as of the beginning of Fiscal 2021. Prior to adoption, the Company had already generally accounted for implementation costs incurred in connection with cloud computing arrangements in a manner consistent with the new standard. Therefore, other than the new disclosure requirements, the adoption of ASU 2018-15 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. See Note 3 for further discussion of the Company's accounting for cloud computing arrangements.\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, \"Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\" (\"ASU 2016-13\"). ASU 2016-13, which was further updated and clarified by the FASB through issuance of additional related ASUs, amends the guidance surrounding measurement and recognition of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, including trade receivables and investments in certain debt securities, by requiring upfront recognition of an allowance for credit losses expected to be incurred over an asset's contractual life based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and supportable forecasts impacting its ultimate collectability. Application of this \"expected loss\" model results in earlier recognition of credit losses than the historical \"as incurred\" model, under which losses were recognized only upon occurrence of an event that gave rise to the incurrence of a probable loss. While the Company's historical bad debt write-off\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nactivity has generally been insignificant, the extent of credit losses ultimately recognized and reflected in its allowance for doubtful accounts under the ASU 2016-13 framework will depend on prevailing conditions and ongoing consideration of information and forecasts that inform the Company's assessments of collectability, similar to past practice. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 as of the beginning of Fiscal 2021 using the modified retrospective basis. Overall, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n5.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment, net consists of the following:\nProperty and equipment, net includes finance lease ROU assets, which are reflected in the table above based on their nature.\nDepreciation expense was $\n227.4\nmillion, $\n246.6\nmillion, and $\n257.8\nmillion during Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020, and Fiscal 2019, respectively, and is recorded primarily within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\n6.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nThe following table details the changes in goodwill for each of the Company's segments during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020:\n(a)\nThe goodwill balance for each period presented is net of accumulated impairment charges of $\n5.2\nmillion related to the Company's other non-reportable segments.\nBased on the results of the Company's goodwill impairment testing in Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020, and Fiscal 2019,\nno\ngoodwill impairment charges were recorded. See Note 12 for further discussion of the Company's goodwill impairment testing.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOther Intangible Assets\nOther intangible assets consist of the following:\nAmortization Expense\nAmortization expense was $\n20.2\nmillion, $\n22.9\nmillion, and $\n23.5\nmillion during Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020, and Fiscal 2019, respectively, and is recorded within SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nBased on the balance of the Company's finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization as of March 27, 2021, the expected amortization expense for each of the next five fiscal years and thereafter is as follows:\nThe expected future amortization expense above reflects weighted-average estimated remaining useful lives of\n9.0\nyears for re-acquired licensed trademarks,\n7.7\nyears for customer relationships, and\n8.6\nyears for the Company's finite-lived intangible assets in total.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n7.\nOther Assets and Liabilities\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets consist of the following:\nOther non-current assets consist of the following:\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following:\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOther non-current liabilities consist of the following:\n8.\nImpairment of Assets\nDuring Fiscal 2021, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $\n96.0\nmillion to write-down certain long-lived assets, of which $\n69.4\nmillion related to its restructuring plans (see Note 9), $\n17.5\nmillion related to underperforming stores identified through its ongoing store portfolio evaluation and adverse impacts associated with COVID-19 business disruptions, and $\n9.1\nmillion related to certain previously exited real estate locations for which the related lease agreements have not yet expired.\nDuring Fiscal 2020, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $\n31.6\nmillion to write-down certain long-lived assets, of which $\n8.7\nmillion related to its restructuring plans (see Note 9) and $\n22.9\nmillion related to underperforming stores identified through its ongoing store portfolio evaluation and adverse impacts associated with COVID-19 business disruptions. These charges were recorded within impairment of assets in the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, the Company recorded a $\n7.1\nmillion impairment charge within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations during Fiscal 2020 relating to an equity method investment.\nDuring Fiscal 2019, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $\n21.2\nmillion to write-down certain long-lived assets, of which $\n10.7\nmillion related to its restructuring plans (see Note 9) and $\n10.5\nmillion related to underperforming stores identified through its ongoing store portfolio evaluation. Additionally, as a result of its decision to sell its corporate jet in connection with its cost savings initiative, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $\n4.6\nmillion during Fiscal 2019 to reduce the carrying value of the asset being held-for-sale to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell.\nSee Note 12 for further discussion of the non-cash impairment charges recorded during the fiscal years presented.\n9.\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nA description of significant restructuring and other activities and their related costs is provided below.\nFiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan\nThe Company has begun efforts to realign its resources to support future growth and profitability, and to create a sustainable cost structure. The key areas of the Company's evaluation include its: (i) team organizational structures and ways of working; (ii) real estate footprint and related costs across corporate offices, distribution centers, and direct-to-consumer retail and wholesale doors; and (iii) brand portfolio.\nIn connection with the first initiative, on September 17, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the \"Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan\") to reduce its global workforce by the end of Fiscal 2021. Additionally, during its preliminary review of its store portfolio during the second quarter of Fiscal 2021, the Company made the decision to close its Polo store on Regent Street in London.\nOn October 29, 2020, the Company announced the planned transition of its Chaps brand to a fully licensed business model, consistent with its long-term brand elevation strategy in connection with its third initiative. Specifically, the Company entered into a multi-year licensing partnership, taking effect on August 1, 2021 after a transition period, with an affiliate of 5 Star Apparel LLC, a division of the OVED Group, to manufacture, market, and distribute Chaps menswear and womenswear.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThis agreement is expected to create incremental value for the Company by enabling an even greater focus on elevating its core brands in the marketplace, reducing its direct exposure to the North America department store channel, and setting up Chaps to deliver on its potential with an experienced partner that is focused on nurturing the brand.\nAdditionally, on February 3, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved additional realignment actions related to its real estate initiative. Specifically, the Company plans to further rightsize and consolidate its global corporate offices to better align with its current organizational profile and new ways of working. The Company also expects to close certain of its stores to improve overall profitability. Additionally, the Company plans to complete the consolidation of its existing North America distribution centers in order to drive greater efficiencies, improve sustainability, and deliver a better consumer experience.\nFinally, on May 13, 2021, in connection with its brand portfolio initiative, the Company announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell its Club Monaco business to Regent, L.P., a global private equity firm. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2022.\nIn connection with these collective realignment initiatives, the Company expects to incur total estimated pre-tax charges of approximately $\n300\nmillion to $\n350\nmillion, comprised of cash-related restructuring charges of approximately $\n185\nmillion to $\n200\nmillion and non-cash charges of approximately $\n115\nmillion and $\n150\nmillion. These estimated charges are subject to change based upon the completion of the sale of the Company's Club Monaco business.\nA summary of the charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan during the fiscal period presented (inclusive of immaterial other restructuring-related charges previously recorded during the first quarter of Fiscal 2021) is as follows:\n(a)\nInventory-related charges are recorded within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations.\nA summary of the activity in the restructuring reserve related to the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan is as follows:\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nFiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan\nOn June 4, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan associated with the Company's strategic objective of operating with discipline to drive sustainable growth (the \"Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan\"). The Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan included the following activities: (i) rightsizing and consolidation of the Company's global distribution network and corporate offices; (ii) targeted severance-related actions; and (iii) closure of certain of its stores and shop-within-shops.\nActions associated with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan are complete and no additional charges are expected to be incurred in connection with this plan.\nA summary of the charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan during the fiscal periods presented, as well as the cumulative charges recorded since its inception, is as follows:\n(a)\nInventory-related charges are recorded within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations.\n(b)\nAccelerated stock-based compensation expense, which is recorded within restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations, was recorded in connection with vesting provisions associated with certain separation agreements.\n(c)\nLoss on sale of property, which was recorded within restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations, was incurred in connection with the sale of one of the Company's distribution centers in North America. Total cash proceeds from the sale were $\n20.0\nmillion.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nA summary of the activity in the restructuring reserve related to the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan is as follows:\n(a)\nCertain lease-related liabilities previously recognized in connection with the Company's closure and cessation of use of real estate locations were reclassified and reflected as reductions of the respective operating lease ROU assets initially recognized as of the beginning of Fiscal 2020, upon adoption of new lease accounting rules prescribed by ASU No. 2016-02, \"Leases\" (\"ASU 2016-02\").\nOther Restructuring Plans\nDuring Fiscal 2019, the Company recorded charges of $\n14.2\nmillion in connection with its restructuring plan initiated during its fiscal year ended April 1, 2017, comprised of cash-related restructuring charges of $\n9.2\nmillion and non-cash charges of $\n5.0\nmillion. Actions associated with this plan are complete and no additional charges are expected to be incurred. The Company made cash payments of $\n2.1\nmillion, $\n7.1\nmillion, and $\n73.5\nmillion during Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020, and Fiscal 2019, respectively, which were applied against the reserve associated with this restructuring plan. Additionally, during Fiscal 2020, $\n17.7\nmillion of lease-related liabilities previously recognized in connection with the Company's closure and cessation of use of real estate locations were reclassified and reflected as reductions of the respective operating lease ROU assets initially recognized upon adoption of ASU 2016-02. As of March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020, the remaining restructuring reserve associated with this plan was $\n1.3\nmillion and $\n3.4\nmillion, respectively.\nRefer to Note 9 of the Fiscal 2020 10-K for additional discussion regarding this restructuring plan.\nOther Charges\nDuring Fiscal 2021, the Company recorded other charges of $\n11.4\nmillion primarily related to rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations for which the related lease agreements have not yet expired.\nDuring Fiscal 2020, the Company recorded other charges of $\n20.8\nmillion related to the donation of net cash proceeds received from the sale of its corporate jet. This donation was made to the Ralph Lauren Corporate Foundation (formerly known as the Polo Ralph Lauren Foundation), a non-profit, charitable foundation that supports various philanthropic programs. Additionally, during Fiscal 2020, the Company recorded other charges of $\n8.8\nmillion primarily related to rent and occupancy costs associated with certain previously exited real estate locations for which the related lease agreements had not yet expired.\nDuring Fiscal 2019, the Company recorded other charges of $\n14.1\nmillion related to depreciation expense associated with its former Polo store at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York City, recorded after the store closed during the first quarter of its fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 (\"Fiscal 2018\"). Additionally, during Fiscal 2019, the Company recorded other charges of\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n$\n4.2\nmillion primarily related to a customs audit, as well as $\n18.2\nmillion primarily related to the launch of its new sabbatical leave program, which entitles eligible employees to periodic paid leave based on the attainment of certain employment tenure milestones. Other than this initial charge to establish its estimated liability for services rendered to-date, the Company does not expect there will be a significant, ongoing impact to the consolidated financial statements in future periods related to its sabbatical leave program.\n10.\nIncome Taxes\nSwiss Tax Reform\nIn May 2019, a public referendum was held in Switzerland that approved the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (the \"Swiss Tax Act\"), which became effective January 1, 2020. The Swiss Tax Act eliminates certain preferential tax items at both the federal and cantonal levels for multinational companies and provides the cantons with parameters for establishing local tax rates and regulations. The Swiss Tax Act also provides transitional provisions, one of which allows eligible companies to increase the tax basis of certain assets based on the value generated by their business in previous years, and to amortize such adjustment as a tax deduction over a transitional period.\nDuring the second quarter of Fiscal 2020, the Swiss Tax Act was enacted into law, resulting in an immaterial adjustment associated with the revaluation of the Company's Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities and the then estimated annual effective tax rate. Subsequently, as a result of additional information received from the tax authorities and analyses performed related to the transitional provision noted above, the Company recorded a one-time income tax benefit and corresponding deferred tax asset of $\n122.9\nmillion during Fiscal 2020, which reduced the Company's effective tax rate by\n3,760\nbasis points.\nDuring Fiscal 2021, the Company reduced its one-time tax benefit by $\n13.8\nmillion due to new legislation enacted in connection with the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, which increased the Company's effective tax rate by\n1,840\nbasis points.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nIn January 2018, new U.S. tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\") became effective. The TCJA significantly revised U.S. tax law by, among other provisions, lowering the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate from\n35\n% to\n21\n%, creating a territorial tax system that includes a one-time mandatory transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings, and eliminating or reducing certain income tax deductions.\nU.S. GAAP requires that the effects of changes in tax laws be recognized in the period in which the legislation is enacted. However, due to the complexity and significance of the TCJA's provisions, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\"), which allowed companies to record the tax effects of the TCJA on a provisional basis based on a reasonable estimate, and then, if necessary, subsequently adjust such amounts during a limited measurement period as additional information became available and further analyses were completed. The measurement period ends when a company has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting, not to extend beyond one year from enactment.\nDuring Fiscal 2018, the Company recorded net charges of $\n221.4\nmillion on a provisional basis, inclusive of measurement period adjustments. Subsequently, during Fiscal 2019, the Company completed its analyses and recorded additional net unfavorable measurement period adjustments of $\n27.6\nmillion as a result of the issuance of new interpretive guidance related to stock-based compensation for certain executives and other analyses performed. These measurement period adjustments increased the Company's effective tax rate by\n470\nbasis points during Fiscal 2019. Approximately $\n241\nmillion of the cumulative TCJA enactment-related charges recorded related to the mandatory transition tax (see Note 15).\nAdditionally, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018 the Company reevaluated its permanent reinvestment assertion and determined that undistributed foreign earnings that were subject to the one-time mandatory transition tax were no longer considered to be permanently reinvested, effective December 31, 2017. The mandatory transition tax does not apply to undistributed foreign earnings generated after December 31, 2017, and therefore the Company intends to permanently reinvest such earnings. See \"\nDeferred Taxes\n\" for additional discussion.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe Company also decided to account for the minimum tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") in the period in which it is incurred and therefore has not provided any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in its consolidated financial statements.\nTaxes on Income\nDomestic and foreign pretax income (loss) are as follows:\nBenefits (provisions) for current and deferred income taxes are as follows:\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nTax Rate Reconciliation\nThe differences between income taxes expected at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and income taxes provided are as follows:\n(a)\nEffective tax rate is calculated by dividing the income tax benefit (provision) by income (loss) before income taxes.\nThe Company's Fiscal 2021 effective tax rate was unfavorable to the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of\n21\n% primarily due to incremental tax expense resulting from new legislation enacted in connection with the European Union's anti-tax avoidance directive, valuation allowances recorded against certain deferred tax assets as a result of significant business disruptions attributable to COVID-19, and tax impacts on stock-based compensation and other permanent adjustments, partially offset by an income tax benefit related to charitable contributions. The Company's Fiscal 2020 effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of\n21\n% primarily due to the one-time income tax benefit recorded in connection with the Swiss Tax Act, as previously discussed, the favorable impact of the change in geographic mix of its worldwide earnings and the favorable impact of tax benefits associated with provision to tax return adjustments, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of additional income tax reserves associated with certain income tax audits. The Company's Fiscal 2019 effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of\n21\n% primarily due to the SAB 118 measurement period adjustments recorded, as previously discussed, state and local income taxes, and compensation-related adjustments, partially offset by the favorable impact of the proportion of earnings generated in lower taxed jurisdictions.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nDeferred Taxes\nSignificant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\n(a)\nNet deferred tax balances as of March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 were comprised of non-current deferred tax assets of $\n283.9\nmillion and $\n245.2\nmillion, respectively, recorded within deferred tax assets, and non-current deferred tax liabilities of $\n10.7\nmillion and $\n10.0\nmillion, respectively, recorded within other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company has available federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $\n2.2\nmillion, $\n4.0\nmillion, and $\n17.7\nmillion (all net of tax), respectively, for tax purposes to offset future taxable income. The net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in Fiscal 2022.\nThe Company also has available state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $\n8.5\nmillion and $\n27.4\nmillion (both net of tax), respectively, for which no net deferred tax asset has been recognized. A full valuation allowance has been recorded against these carryforwards since the Company does not believe that it will more likely than not be able to utilize these carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Subsequent recognition of these deferred tax assets would result in an income tax benefit in the year of such recognition. The valuation allowance relating to state net operating loss carryforwards increased by $\n0.7\nmillion (net of tax) as a result of net operating losses in certain jurisdictions where the Company does not believe that it will more likely than not be able to utilize these carryforwards in the future. The valuation allowance relating to foreign net operating loss carryforwards decreased by $\n0.7\nmillion as a result of reductions in net operating losses in certain jurisdictions.\nAs a result of the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings in connection with the TCJA, the Company reevaluated its permanent reinvestment assertion and determined that undistributed foreign earnings that were subject to the TCJA's one-time mandatory transition tax were no longer considered to be permanently reinvested, effective December 31, 2017. The mandatory transition tax does not apply to undistributed foreign earnings generated after December 31, 2017. Accordingly, provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on approximately $\n1.336\nbillion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries generated after December 31, 2017, as such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested. These earnings could become subject to tax if they were remitted as dividends, if foreign earnings were lent to RLC, a subsidiary or a U.S. affiliate of RLC, or if the stock of the subsidiaries were sold. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nUncertain Income Tax Benefits\nFiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020, and Fiscal 2019 Activity\nReconciliations of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020, and Fiscal 2019 are presented below:\nThe Company classifies interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of its provision for income taxes.\nReconciliations of the beginning and ending amounts of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits for Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020, and Fiscal 2019 are presented below:\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, was $\n91.4\nmillion and $\n88.9\nmillion as of March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively, and was included within the non-current liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the consolidated balance sheets. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Company's effective tax rate was $\n68.0\nmillion and $\n71.7\nmillion as of March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively.\nFuture Changes in Unrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to the Company's tax positions is subject to change based on future events including, but not limited to, settlements of ongoing tax audits and assessments and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. Although the outcomes and timing of such events are highly uncertain, the Company does not anticipate that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, will change significantly during the next twelve months. However, changes in the occurrence, expected outcomes, and timing of such events could cause the Company's current estimate to change materially in the future.\nThe Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as tax returns in various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is generally no longer subject to examinations by the relevant tax authorities for years prior to its fiscal year ended March 30, 2013.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n11.\nDebt\nDebt consists of the following:\n(a)\nThe carrying value of the 2.625% Senior Notes as of March 28, 2020 is presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $\n0.2\nmillion and also reflects an adjustment of $\n0.2\nmillion associated with a related interest rate swap contract (see Note 13).\n(b)\nThe carrying value of the 3.750% Senior Notes is presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $\n2.9\nmillion and $\n3.6\nmillion as of March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively.\n(c)\nThe carrying value of the 1.700% Senior Notes is presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $\n1.6\nmillion as of March 27, 2021.\n(d)\nThe carrying value of the 2.950% Senior Notes is presented net of unamortized debt issuance costs and original issue discount of $\n12.6\nmillion as of March 27, 2021.\nSenior Notes\nIn August 2018, the Company completed a registered public debt offering and issued $\n400\nmillion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due\nSeptember 15, 2025\n, which bear interest at a fixed rate of\n3.750\n%, payable semi-annually (the \"3.750% Senior Notes\"). The 3.750% Senior Notes were issued at a price equal to\n99.521\n% of their principal amount. The proceeds from this offering were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of the Company's previously outstanding $\n300\nmillion principal amount of unsecured\n2.125\n% senior notes that matured\nSeptember 26, 2018\n(the \"2.125% Senior Notes\").\nIn June 2020, the Company completed another registered public debt offering and issued an additional $\n500\nmillion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due\nJune 15, 2022\n, which bear interest at a fixed rate of\n1.700\n%, payable semi-annually (the \"1.700% Senior Notes\"), and $\n750\nmillion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due\nJune 15, 2030\n, which bear interest at a fixed rate of\n2.950\n%, payable semi-annually (the \"2.950% Senior Notes\"). The 1.700% Senior Notes and 2.950% Senior Notes were issued at prices equal to\n99.880\n% and\n98.995\n% of their principal amounts, respectively. The proceeds from these offerings are being used for general corporate purposes, which included the repayment of $\n475\nmillion previously outstanding under the Company's Global Credit Facility (as defined below) on June 3, 2020 and repayment of its previously outstanding $\n300\nmillion principal amount of unsecured\n2.625\n% senior notes that matured\nAugust 18, 2020\n(the \"2.625% Senior Notes\").\nThe Company has the option to redeem the 3.750% Senior Notes, 1.700% Senior Notes, and 2.950% Senior Notes (collectively, the \"Senior Notes\"), in whole or in part, at any time at a price equal to accrued and unpaid interest on the redemption date plus the greater of (i)\n100\n% of the principal amount of the series of Senior Notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present value of Remaining Scheduled Payments, as defined in the supplemental indentures governing such Senior Notes (together with the indenture governing the Senior Notes, the \"Indenture\").\nThe Indenture contains certain covenants that restrict the Company's ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur certain liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; consolidate or merge with another party; or sell, lease, or convey all or substantially all of the Company's property or assets to another party. However, the Indenture does not contain any financial covenants.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nCommercial Paper\nThe Company has a commercial paper borrowing program that allows it to issue up to $\n500\nmillion of unsecured commercial paper notes through private placement using third-party broker-dealers (the \"Commercial Paper Program\").\nBorrowings under the Commercial Paper Program are supported by the Global Credit Facility, as defined below. Accordingly, the Company does not expect combined borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and Global Credit Facility to exceed $\n500\nmillion. Commercial Paper Program borrowings may be used to support the Company's general working capital and corporate needs. Maturities of commercial paper notes vary, but cannot exceed\n397\ndays from the date of issuance. Commercial paper notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program rank equally in seniority with the Company's other forms of unsecured indebtedness. As of both March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 there were\nno\nborrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program.\nRevolving Credit Facilities\nGlobal Credit Facility\nIn August 2019, the Company replaced its existing credit facility and entered into a new credit facility that provides for a $\n500\nmillion senior unsecured revolving line of credit through\nAugust 12, 2024\n(the \"Global Credit Facility\") under terms and conditions substantially similar to those of the previous facility. The Global Credit Facility is also used to support the issuance of letters of credit and maintenance of the Commercial Paper Program. Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility may be denominated in U.S. Dollars and certain other currencies, including Euros, Hong Kong Dollars, and Japanese Yen, and are guaranteed by all of the Company's domestic significant subsidiaries. In accordance with the terms of the agreement governing the Global Credit Facility, the Company has the ability to expand its borrowing availability under the Global Credit Facility to $\n1\nbillion, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the Global Credit Facility.\nUnder the Global Credit Facility as originally implemented, U.S. Dollar-denominated borrowings bear interest, at the Company's option, either at (a) a base rate, by reference to the greatest of: (i) the annual prime commercial lending rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect from time to time, (ii) the weighted-average overnight Federal funds rate plus\n50\nbasis points, or (iii) one-month LIBOR plus\n100\nbasis points; or (b) LIBOR, adjusted for the Federal Reserve Board's Eurocurrency liabilities maximum reserve percentage, plus a spread of\n75\nbasis points, subject to adjustment based on the Company's credit ratings (\"Adjusted LIBOR\"). Foreign currency-denominated borrowings bear interest at Adjusted LIBOR. In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Global Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the Global Credit Facility relating to the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate of\n6.5\nbasis points is subject to adjustment based on the Company's credit ratings. These provisions were amended in May 2020, as discussed further below.\nThe Global Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Company's ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens; sell or dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances, or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make certain investments. As originally implemented, the Global Credit Facility also required the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to Consolidated EBITDAR (the \"leverage ratio\") of no greater than\n4.25\nas of the date of measurement for the\nfour\nmost recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Adjusted Debt is defined generally as consolidated debt outstanding, including finance lease obligations, plus all operating lease obligations. Consolidated EBITDAR is defined generally as consolidated net income plus (i) income tax expense, (ii) net interest expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense, (iv) operating lease cost, (v) restructuring and other non-recurring expenses, and (vi) acquisition-related costs.\nThis requirement was amended in May 2020, as discussed below.\nIn May 2020, the Company entered into an amendment of its Global Credit Facility (the \"Amendment\"). Under the Amendment, until the earlier of (a) the date on which the Company provides the periodic reporting information required under the Global Credit Facility for the quarter ending September 30, 2021 and (b) the date on which the Company certifies that its leverage ratio as of the last day of the two most recent fiscal quarters was no greater than\n4.25\n(the \"Ratings-Based Toggle Date\"), for loans based on Adjusted LIBOR, the spread over Adjusted LIBOR will be increased to\n187.5\nbasis points, the spread on loans based on the base rate will be\n87.5\nbasis points and the commitment fee will be increased to\n25\nbasis points, in each case with no adjustments based on the Company's credit ratings. The pricing will return to the original levels set forth in the Global Credit Facility on the Ratings-Based Toggle Date. Additionally, the leverage ratio requirements have been waived\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nuntil the quarter ending September 30, 2021. The maximum permitted leverage ratio for that fiscal quarter would be\n5.25\n. For the fiscal quarters ending December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, the maximum permitted leverage ratio would be\n4.75\n. For each fiscal quarter ending on or after June 30, 2022, the maximum permitted leverage ratio would return to\n4.25\n. The Amendment also (a) imposes a new requirement that would remain in effect until the Ratings-Based Toggle Date that the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash of the Company and its subsidiaries plus the undrawn amounts available under the Global Credit Facility may not be less than $\n750\nmillion, (b) restricts the amount of dividends and distributions on, or purchases, redemptions, repurchases, retirements or acquisitions of, the Company's stock until the Specified Period Termination Date (as defined below), (c) until March 31, 2021, amends the material adverse change representation to disregard pandemic-related impacts to the business, and (d) until the Specified Period Termination Date, adds certain other restrictions on indebtedness incurred by the Company and its subsidiaries and investments and acquisitions by the Company and its subsidiaries. The \"Specified Period Termination Date\" is the earlier of (i) the date on which the Company provides the periodic reporting information required under the Global Credit Facility for the quarter ending June 30, 2022 and (ii) the date on which the Company certifies that its leverage ratio as of the last day of the two most recent fiscal quarters was no greater than\n4.25\n.\nUpon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Global Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Global Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The Global Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (many of which are subject to applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure to make timely principal, interest, and fee payments or to satisfy the covenants, including the financial covenant described above. Additionally, the Global Credit Facility provides that an Event of Default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company's Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, and entities controlled by the Lauren family fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power of the Company's common stock. As of March 27, 2021,\nno Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Global Credit Facility) has occurred under the Company's Global Credit Facility\n.\nIn March 2020, the Company borrowed $\n475.0\nmillion under the Global Credit Facility as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen its liquidity position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These borrowings were subsequently repaid in June 2020. As of March 27, 2021, there were\nno\nborrowings outstanding under the Global Credit Facility and the Company was contingently liable for $\n8.9\nmillion of outstanding letters of credit\n364 Day Facility\nIn May 2020, the Company entered into a new credit facility with the same lenders that are parties to the Global Credit Facility (the \"364 Day Facility\") as a preemptive measure to strengthen its liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 364 Day Facility provided for a $\n500\nmillion senior unsecured revolving line of credit through\nMay 25, 2021\n, provided that the maturity date may be earlier if the Company was to issue senior notes other than to refinance the previously outstanding 2.625% Senior Notes. In connection with the issuances of the 1.700% Senior Notes and the 2.950% Senior Notes in June 2020, the 364 Day Facility automatically terminated in accordance with its terms because the aggregate proceeds received upon issuance of these senior notes exceeded the amount necessary to refinance the 2.625% Senior Notes.\nPan-Asia Borrowing Facilities\nCertain of the Company's subsidiaries in Asia have uncommitted credit facilities with regional branches of JPMorgan Chase in China and South Korea (the \"Pan-Asia Credit Facilities\"). Additionally, the Company's Japan subsidiary has an uncommitted overdraft facility with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (the \"Japan Overdraft Facility\"). The Pan-Asia Credit Facilities and Japan Overdraft Facility (collectively, the \"Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities\") are subject to annual renewal and may be used to fund general working capital needs of the Company's operations in the respective countries. Borrowings under the Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities are guaranteed by the parent company and are granted at the sole discretion of the respective banks, subject to availability of the banks' funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements. The Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities do not contain any financial covenants. A summary of the Company's Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities by country is as follows:\n•\nChina Credit Facility\n— provides Ralph Lauren Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. with a revolving line of credit of up to\n50\nmillion Chinese Renminbi (approximately $\n8\nmillion) through\nApril 3, 2022\n, which is also able to be used to support bank guarantees.\n•\nSouth Korea Credit Facility\n— provides Ralph Lauren (Korea) Ltd. with a revolving line of credit of up to\n30\nbillion South Korean Won (approximately $\n26\nmillion) through\nOctober 29, 2021\n.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n•\nJapan Overdraft Facility\n— provides Ralph Lauren Corporation Japan with an overdraft amount of up to\n5\nbillion Japanese Yen (approximately $\n46\nmillion) through\nApril 28, 2022\n.\nAs of both March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 there were\nno\nborrowings outstanding under the Pan-Asia Borrowing Facilities.\n12.\nFair Value Measurements\nU.S. GAAP establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The determination of the applicable level within the hierarchy for a particular asset or liability depends on the inputs used in its valuation as of the measurement date, notably the extent to which the inputs are market-based (observable) or internally-derived (unobservable). A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are defined as follows:\n•\nLevel 1\n— inputs to the valuation methodology based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n•\nLevel 2\n— inputs to the valuation methodology based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; and model-derived valuations whose inputs or significant value drivers are observable.\n•\nLevel 3\n— inputs to the valuation methodology based on unobservable prices or valuation techniques that are significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's financial assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding accrued interest components:\n(a)\nBased on Level 2 measurements.\n(b)\nAmounts are included within short-term investments in the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe Company's investments in commercial paper are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets using external pricing data, based on interest rates and credit ratings for similar issuances with the same remaining term as the Company's investments. To the extent the Company invests in bonds, such investments are also classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets based on quoted prices in active markets.\nThe Company's derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets and are valued using pricing models that are primarily based on market observable external inputs, including spot and forward currency exchange rates, benchmark interest rates, and discount rates consistent with the instrument's tenor, and consider the impact of the Company's own credit risk, if any. Changes in counterparty credit risk are also considered in the valuation of derivative financial instruments.\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and time deposits are recorded at carrying value, which generally approximates fair value based on Level 1 measurements.\nThe Company's debt instruments are recorded at their carrying values in its consolidated balance sheets, which may differ from their respective fair values. The fair values of the Senior Notes are estimated based on external pricing data, including available quoted market prices, and with reference to comparable debt instruments with similar interest rates, credit ratings, and trading frequency, among other factors. The fair values of the Company's commercial paper notes and borrowings\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\noutstanding under its credit facilities, if any, are estimated using external pricing data, based on interest rates and credit ratings for similar issuances with the same remaining term as the Company's outstanding borrowings. Due to their short-term nature, the fair values of the Company's commercial paper notes and borrowings outstanding under its credit facilities, if any, generally approximate their carrying values.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying values and the estimated fair values of the Company's debt instruments:\n(a)\nSee Note 11 for discussion of the carrying values of the Company's senior notes.\n(b)\nBased on Level 2 measurements.\nUnrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the Company's debt instruments do not result in the realization or expenditure of cash, unless the debt is retired prior to its maturity.\nNon-financial Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company's non-financial assets, which primarily consist of goodwill, other intangible assets, property and equipment, and lease-related ROU assets, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and instead are reported at carrying value in its consolidated balance sheet. However, on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be fully recoverable (and at least annually for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets), the respective carrying value of non-financial assets are assessed for impairment and, if ultimately considered impaired, are adjusted and written down to their fair value, as estimated based on consideration of external market participant assumptions and discounted cash flows.\nDuring Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020, and Fiscal 2019, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair values. The fair values of these assets were determined based on Level 3 measurements, the related inputs of which included estimates of the amount and timing of the assets' net future discounted cash flows (including any potential sublease income for lease-related ROU assets), based on historical experience and consideration of current trends, market conditions, and comparable sales, as applicable.\nThe following tables summarize non-cash impairment charges recorded by the Company during the fiscal years presented in order to reduce the carrying values of certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair values as of the assessment date:\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(a)\nImpairment of equity method investment is recorded within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. All other impairment charges are recorded within impairments of assets in the consolidated statements of operations, unless otherwise noted.\n(b)\nTotal impairment charges for Fiscal 2019 includes $\n4.6\nmillion recorded to reduce the carrying value of the Company's corporate jet being held-for-sale to its estimated fair value, less costs to sell of $\n20.8\nmillion as of March 30, 2019. This balance was reclassified from property and equipment, net to prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet upon being classified as an asset held-for-sale. The asset was subsequently sold during Fiscal 2020.\n(c)\nTotal impairment charges for Fiscal 2020 includes $\n225.1\nmillion recorded in connection with the Company's adoption of ASU 2016-02 as of the beginning of Fiscal 2020 which, net of related income tax benefits, reduced its opening retained earnings balance by $\n169.4\nmillion.\nSee Note 8 for additional discussion regarding non-cash impairment charges recorded by the Company within the consolidated statements of operations during the fiscal years presented.\nNo\nimpairment charges associated with goodwill or other intangible assets were recorded during any of the fiscal years presented. In Fiscal 2021, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment using a qualitative approach as of the beginning of the second quarter of the fiscal year. In performing the assessment, the Company identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that affected the fair values and/or carrying amounts of its reporting units with allocated goodwill. These factors included external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as the Company's actual and expected financial performance. Additionally, the Company also considered the results of its most recent quantitative goodwill impairment test, which was performed as of the end of Fiscal 2020 and incorporated assumptions related to COVID-19 business disruptions, the results of which indicated that the fair values of these reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. Based on the results of its qualitative goodwill impairment assessment, the Company concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units are less than their respective carrying values, and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment.\n13.\nFinancial Instruments\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily relating to certain anticipated cash flows and the value of the reported net assets of its international operations, as well as changes in the fair value of its fixed-rate debt obligations attributed to changes in benchmark interest rates. Accordingly, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage and mitigate such risks. The Company does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's outstanding derivative instruments recorded on its consolidated balance sheets as of March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020:\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(a)\nFC = Forward foreign currency exchange contracts; IRS = Interest rate swap contracts.\n(b)\nPP = Prepaid expenses and other current assets; AE = Accrued expenses and other current liabilities; ONCA = Other non-current assets; ONCL = Other non-current liabilities.\n(c)\nIncludes cross-currency swaps designated as hedges of the Company's net investment in certain foreign operations.\n(d)\nRelates to third-party and intercompany foreign currency-denominated exposures and balances.\nThe Company presents the fair values of its derivative assets and liabilities recorded on its consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis, even when they are subject to master netting arrangements. However, if the Company were to offset and record the asset and liability balances of all of its derivative instruments on a net basis in accordance with the terms of each of its master netting arrangements, spread across\nten\nseparate counterparties, the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets as of March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020 would be adjusted from the current gross presentation as detailed in the following table:\nThe Company's master netting arrangements do not require cash collateral to be pledged by the Company or its counterparties. See Note 3 for further discussion of the Company's master netting arrangements.\nThe following tables summarize the pretax impact of gains and losses from the Company's designated derivative instruments on its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years presented:\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(a)\nAmounts recognized in OCI relating to the effective portion of the Company's net investment hedges would be recognized in earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of the hedged net investment.\nAs of March 27, 2021, it is estimated that $\n4.9\nmillion of pretax n\net gains on both outstanding and matured derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges deferred in AOCI will be recognized in earnings over the next twelve months. Amounts ultimately recognized in earnings will depend on exchange rates in effect when outstanding derivative instruments are settled.\nThe following table summarizes the pretax impact of gains and losses from the Company's undesignated derivative instruments on its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years presented:\nRisk Management Strategies\nForward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts\nThe Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate its risk related to exchange rate fluctuations on inventory transactions made in an entity's non-functional currency, the settlement of foreign currency-denominated balances, and the translation of certain foreign operations' net assets into U.S. dollars. As part of its overall strategy for managing the level of exposure to such exchange rate risk, relating primarily to the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the South Korean Won, the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, and the Chinese Renminbi, the Company generally hedges a portion of its related exposures anticipated over the next\ntwelve months\nusing forward foreign currency exchange contracts with maturities of\ntwo months\nto\none year\nto provide continuing coverage over the period of the respective exposure.\nInterest Rate Swap Contracts\nThe Company periodically designates pay-floating rate, receive-fixed rate interest rate swap contracts as hedges against changes in the fair value of its fixed-rate debt attributed to changes in a benchmark interest rate. To the extent of their notional amount, such contracts effectively swap the fixed interest rate on certain of the Company's fixed-rate senior notes for a variable interest rate based on the 3-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread. Changes in the fair value of the Company's interest rate swap contracts were offset by changes in the fair value of the corresponding senior notes attributed to changes in the benchmark interest rate, with\nno\nresulting net impact reflected in earnings during any of the fiscal years presented.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of the hedged senior notes and the impacts of the related fair value hedging adjustments as of March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020:\n(a)\nThe interest rate swap contract designated as a fair value hedge of the Company's 2.625% Senior Notes was settled during Fiscal 2021 at a loss of\n$\n0.3\nmillion\n.\nCross-Currency Swap Contracts\nThe Company periodically designates (i) pay-floating rate, receive-floating rate cross-currency swap contracts or (ii) pay-fixed rate, receive fixed-rate cross-currency swap contracts as hedges of its net investment in certain of its European subsidiaries.\nThe Company's pay-floating rate, receive-floating rate cross-currency swap contracts swap U.S. Dollar-denominated variable interest rate payments based on the contract's notional amount and 3-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread (as paid under a corresponding interest rate swap contract discussed above) for Euro-denominated variable interest rate payments based on 3-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate (\"EURIBOR\") plus a fixed spread, which, in combination with the corresponding interest rate swap contract, economically converts a portion of the Company's fixed-rate U.S. Dollar-denominated senior note obligations to floating-rate Euro-denominated obligations.\nThe Company's pay-fixed rate, receive-fixed rate cross-currency swap contracts swap U.S. Dollar-denominated fixed interest rate payments based on the contract's notional amount and the fixed rate of interest payable on certain of the Company's senior notes for Euro-denominated fixed interest rate payments, thereby economically converting a portion of its fixed-rate U.S. Dollar-denominated senior note obligations to fixed-rate Euro-denominated obligations.\nSee Note 3 for further discussion of the Company's accounting policies relating to its derivative financial instruments.\nInvestments\nAs of March 27, 2021, the Company's investments were all classified as short-term and consisted of $\n197.5\nmillion of time deposits. The Company's investments as of March 28, 2020 were also all classified as short-term and consisted of $\n252.3\nmillion of time deposits and $\n243.6\nmillion of commercial paper.\nNo significant realized or unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale investments or impairment charges were recorded in any of the fiscal years presented.\nSee Note 3 for further discussion of the Company's accounting policies relating to its investments.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n14.\nLeases\nThe following table summarizes ROU assets and lease liabilities recorded on the Company's consolidated balance sheet:\nThe following table summarizes the composition of total lease cost during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020:\n(a)\nDuring Fiscal 2021, $\n3.4\nmillion was included within cost of goods sold, $\n307.0\nmillion was included within SG&A expenses, and $\n13.1\nmillion was included within restructuring and other charges. During Fiscal 2020, $\n4.4\nmillion was included within cost of goods sold, $\n307.3\nmillion was included within SG&A expenses, and $\n10.3\nmillion was included within restructuring and other charges.\n(b)\nDuring Fiscal 2021, $\n4.5\nmillion was included within cost of goods sold and $\n220.2\nmillion was included within SG&A expenses. During Fiscal 2020, $\n4.7\nmillion was included within cost of goods sold, $\n290.3\nmillion was included within SG&A expenses, and $\n3.0\nmillion was included within restructuring and other charges.\nDuring Fiscal 2019, in accordance with lease accounting guidance then in effect (prior to adoption of ASU 2016-02), the Company recognized rent expense of approximately $\n449.3\nmillion, net of insignificant sublease income, related to its operating leases, which included contingent rental charges of approximately $\n192.0\nmillion and does not include costs related to non-lease components.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes certain cash flow information related to the Company's leases:\nSee Note 21 for supplemental non-cash information related to ROU assets recorded in connection with the recognition of new lease liabilities.\nThe following table presents a maturity analysis summary of contractual cash payments for the Company's lease liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 27, 2021:\nAdditionally, the Company has $\n107.4\nmillion of future payment obligations relating to executed lease agreements for which the related lease terms had not yet commenced as of the end of Fiscal 2021, and, therefore, are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 27, 2021.\nThe following table summarizes the weighted-average remaining lease terms and weighted-average discount rates related to the Company's operating and finance leases recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 27, 2021:\nSee Note 3 for discussion of the Company's accounting policies related to leases.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n15.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nU.S. Tax Reform\nIn connection with the TCJA's provision that subjects previously deferred foreign earnings to a one-time mandatory transition tax, the Company recorded cumulative charges of approximately $\n241\nmillion within its income tax provision in prior fiscal years (as described in Note 10). The remaining related income tax payable obligation of $\n132.7\nmillion as of March 27, 2021, which was reduced by foreign tax credits and other federal income tax activity, is expected to be paid as follows:\n(a)\nIncluded within current and non-current income tax payable in the consolidated balance sheets based upon the estimated timing of payments.\nSee Note 10 for further discussion of the TCJA and its enactment-related impacts on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nEmployee Agreements\nThe Company has employment agreements with certain executives in the normal course of business which provide for compensation and certain other benefits. These agreements also provide for severance payments under certain circumstances.\nOther Commitments\nOther off-balance sheet firm commitments amounted to $\n1.190\nbillion as of March 27, 2021, including inventory purchase commitments of $\n713.7\nmillion, lease commitments related to lease agreements for which the related lease terms have not yet commenced of $\n107.4\nmillion, outstanding letters of credit of $\n8.9\nmillion, interest payments related to the Company's debt of $\n282.4\nmillion, and other commitments of $\n77.2\nmillion, comprised of the Company's legally-binding obligations under sponsorship, licensing, and other marketing and advertising agreements, information technology-related service agreements, and pension-related obligations.\nOther Matters\nThe Company is involved, from time to time, in litigation, other legal claims, and proceedings involving matters associated with or incidental to its business, including, among other things, matters involving credit card fraud, trademark and other intellectual property, licensing, importation and exportation of its products, taxation, unclaimed property, and employee relations. The Company believes at present that the resolution of currently pending matters will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements. However, the Company's assessment of any current litigation or other legal claims could potentially change in light of the discovery of facts not presently known or determinations by judges, juries, or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management's evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or claims.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements that provide general indemnifications. The Company has not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements in the past and does not currently anticipate incurring any material indemnification payments.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n16.\nEquity\nCapital Stock\nThe Company's capital stock consists of\ntwo\nclasses of common stock. There are\n500\nmillion shares of Class A common stock and\n100\nmillion shares of Class B common stock authorized to be issued. Shares of Class A and Class B common stock have substantially identical rights, except with respect to voting rights. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to\none\nvote per share and holders of Class B common stock are entitled to\nten\nvotes per share. Holders of both classes of stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to the stockholders for their approval, except with respect to the election and removal of directors or as otherwise required by applicable law. All outstanding shares of Class B common stock are owned by Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Company's Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, and entities controlled by the Lauren family, and are convertible at any time into shares of Class A common stock on a\none-for-one\nbasis.\nClass B Common Stock Conversions\nDuring Fiscal 2020, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., a limited liability company managed by the children of Mr. Ralph Lauren, converted\n1.0\nmillion shares of Class B common stock into an equal number of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of the security. These conversions occurred in advance of a sales plan providing for the sale of such shares of Class A common stock pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 subject to the conditions set forth therein. These transactions resulted in a reclassification within equity and had no effect on the Company's consolidated balance sheet.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nA summary of the Company's repurchases of Class A common stock under its common stock repurchase program is as follows:\nOn May 13, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved an expansion of the Company's existing common stock repurchase program that allowed it to repurchase up to an additional $\n600\nmillion of Class A common stock. As of March 27, 2021, the remaining availability under the Company's Class A common stock repurchase program was approximately $\n580\nmillion. Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are subject to certain restrictions under the Company's Global Credit Facility and more generally overall business and market conditions. Accordingly, as a result of business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 the Company temporarily suspended its common stock repurchase program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen its liquidity position.\nIn addition, during Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020, and Fiscal 2019,\n0.5\nmillion,\n0.4\nmillion, and\n0.3\nmillion shares of Class A common stock, respectively, at a cost of $\n37.7\nmillion, $\n44.5\nmillion, and $\n32.6\nmillion, respectively, were surrendered to or withheld by the Company in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under the Company's long-term stock incentive plans.\nRepurchased and surrendered shares are accounted for as treasury stock at cost and held in treasury for future use.\nDividends\nExcept as discussed below, the Company has maintained a regular quarterly cash dividend program on its common stock since 2003. On May 13, 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved an increase to the Company's quarterly cash dividend on its common stock from $\n0.625\nto $\n0.6875\nper share.\nAs a result of business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, effective beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 the Company temporarily suspended its quarterly cash dividend program as a preemptive action to preserve cash and strengthen its liquidity position. On May 19, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of its\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nquarterly cash dividend program at the pre-pandemic amount of $\n0.6875\nper share. The first quarterly dividend since such reinstatement will be payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 25, 2021, and will be paid on July 9, 2021.\nThe Company intends to pay regular dividends on its outstanding common stock. However, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend on the Company's results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant, including economic and market conditions.\n17.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe following table presents OCI activity, net of tax, accumulated in equity:\n(a)\nOCI before reclassifications to earnings related to foreign currency translation gains (losses) includes an income tax benefit of $\n22.1\nmillion for Fiscal 2021 and includes income tax provisions of $\n9.2\nmillion and $\n10.8\nmillion for Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. OCI before reclassifications to earnings includes a loss of $\n65.6\nmillion (net of a $\n20.7\nmillion income tax benefit) for Fiscal 2021 and includes gains of $\n29.0\nmillion (net of a $\n9.4\nmillion income tax provision) and $\n50.2\nmillion (net of a $\n15.9\nmillion income tax provision) for Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively, related to the effective portion of changes in the fair values of instruments designated as hedges of the Company's net investment in certain foreign operations (see Note 13). Amounts reclassified from AOCI to earnings related to foreign currency translation gains (losses) during Fiscal 2020 relate to the reclassification to retained earnings of income tax effects stranded in AOCI.\n(b)\nOCI before reclassifications to earnings related to net unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges are presented net of an income tax benefit of $\n0.5\nmillion for Fiscal 2021 and are presented net of income tax provisions of $\n2.8\nmillion and $\n5.3\nmillion for Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively. The tax effects on amounts reclassified from AOCI to earnings are presented in a table below.\n(c)\nOCI before reclassifications to earnings related to net unrealized gains (losses) on defined benefit plans are presented net of an income tax provision of $\n1.2\nmillion for Fiscal 2021. The tax effects on OCI before reclassifications to earnings were immaterial for the other periods presented, and were immaterial for amounts reclassified from AOCI to earnings for all periods presented.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe following table presents reclassifications from AOCI to earnings for cash flow hedges, by component:\n(a)\nFC = Forward foreign currency exchange contracts.\n18.\nStock-based Compensation\nLong-term Stock Incentive Plans\nOn August 1, 2019, the Company's shareholders approved the 2019 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2019 Incentive Plan\"), which replaced the Company's Amended and Restated 2010 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2010 Incentive Plan\"). The 2019 Incentive Plan provided for\n1.2\nmillion of new shares authorized for issuance to the participants, in addition to the approximately\n3.0\nmillion shares that remained available for issuance under the 2010 Incentive Plan as of August 1, 2019. In addition, any outstanding awards under the 2010 Incentive Plan or the Company's 1997 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the \"1997 Incentive Plan\") that expire, are forfeited, or are surrendered to the Company in satisfaction of taxes, will become available for issuance under the 2019 Incentive Plan. The 2019 Incentive Plan became effective August 1, 2019 and no further grants will be made under the 2010 Incentive Plan. Outstanding awards issued prior to August 1, 2019 will continue to remain subject to the terms of the 2010 Incentive Plan or 1997 Incentive Plan, as applicable. As of March 27, 2021,\n3.2\nmillion shares remained available for future issuance under the Company's incentive plans.\nStock-based compensation awards that may be made under the 2019 Incentive Plan include, but are not limited to, (i) restricted stock, (ii) RSUs, and (iii) stock options. During the fiscal periods presented, annual grants consisted entirely of restricted stock and RSUs. Additionally, for RSUs granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, vesting continues post-retirement for all or a portion of the remaining unvested RSUs.\nImpact on Results\nA summary of total stock-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefits recognized is as follows:\n(a)\nFiscal 2020 includes $\n3.6\nmillion of accelerated stock-based compensation expense recorded within restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations (see Note 9). All other stock-based compensation expense was recorded within SG&A expenses.\nThe Company issues its annual grants of stock-based compensation awards in the first half of each fiscal year. Due to the timing of the annual grants and other factors, including the timing and magnitude of forfeiture and performance goal achievement adjustments, as well as changes to the size and composition of the eligible employee population, stock-based compensation expense recognized during any given fiscal period is not indicative of the level of compensation expense expected to be incurred in future periods.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nRestricted Stock Awards and Service-based RSUs\nRestricted stock awards granted to non-employee directors vest ratably over a\nthree-year\nperiod, subject to the director's continued service to the Company. The fair values of restricted stock awards are based on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant. Holders of restricted shares are entitled to receive cash dividends in connection with the payments of dividends on the Company's Class A common stock. Effective beginning Fiscal 2019, non-employee directors are now granted service-based RSUs in lieu of restricted shares.\nService-based RSUs granted to certain of the Company's senior executives and other employees, as well as non-employee directors, generally vest over a\nthree-year\nperiod, subject to the employee's continuing employment (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed). The fair values of service-based RSUs are based on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and unvested.\nA summary of restricted stock and service-based RSU activity during Fiscal 2021 is as follows:\nAdditional information pertaining to restricted stock and service-based RSU activity is as follows:\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nPerformance-based RSUs\nThe Company grants performance-based RSUs to its senior executives and other key employees. The fair values of performance-based RSUs are based on the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant, adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for any awards for which dividend equivalent amounts do not accrue while outstanding and unvested. Performance-based RSUs generally vest (i) upon the completion of a\nthree-year\nperiod of time (cliff vesting), subject to the employee's continuing employment (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed) and the Company's achievement of certain performance goals established at the beginning of the\nthree-year\nperformance period or (ii) ratably, over a\nthree-year\nperiod of time (graded vesting), subject to the employee's continuing employment during the applicable vesting period (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed) and the achievement by the Company of certain performance goals in the initial year of the\nthree-year\nvesting period.\nFor performance-based RSUs subject to cliff vesting, beginning with grants in Fiscal 2019, the number of shares that may be earned ranges between\n0\n% (if the specified threshold performance level is not attained) and\n200\n% (if performance meets or exceeds the maximum achievement level) of the awards originally granted. For such awards granted in recent years prior to Fiscal 2019, the number of shares that may be earned ranges between\n0\n% (if the specified threshold performance level is not attained) and\n150\n% (if performance meets or exceeds the maximum achievement level) of the awards originally granted. If actual performance exceeds the pre-established threshold, the number of shares earned is calculated based on the relative performance between specified levels of achievement.\nNo performance-based awards were granted during Fiscal 2021 as the Company elected to temporarily issue service-based RSUs in lieu of performance-based RSUs as a result of business disruptions and uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, performance metrics of certain cliff-vesting performance-based RSUs granted during prior years were changed during Fiscal 2021 and their related payout ranges lowered, with no resulting incremental compensation cost.\nMarket-based RSUs\nDuring Fiscal 2019, the Company began granting cliff vesting RSU awards to its senior executives and other key employees, which, in addition to being subject to continuing employment requirements (except for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or employees who become retirement-eligible prior to the end of the awards' respective stated vesting periods, as previously discussed), are also subject to a market condition based on a TSR performance metric. The number of shares that vest upon the completion of a\nthree-year\nperiod of time is determined by comparing the Company's TSR relative to that of a pre-established peer group over the related\nthree-year\nperformance period. Depending on the Company's level of achievement against its TSR performance goals, the number of shares that ultimately vest may range from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of the awards originally granted.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its TSR awards on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation, which models multiple stock price paths of the Company's Class A common stock and that of its peer group to evaluate and determine its ultimate expected relative TSR performance ranking. Compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded regardless of whether, and the extent to which, the market condition is ultimately satisfied. No such awards were granted during Fiscal 2021 as the Company has elected to temporarily issue service-based RSUs in lieu of performance-based RSUs as a result of business disruptions and uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe assumptions used to estimate the fair value of TSR awards granted during Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 were as follows:\nA summary of performance-based RSU activity including TSR awards during Fiscal 2021 is as follows:\nAdditional information pertaining to performance-based RSU activity including TSR awards is as follows:\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nStock Options\nStock options are granted to employees and non-employee directors with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant. Generally, options become exercisable ratably (graded-vesting schedule) over a\nthree-year\nvesting period, subject to the employee's continuing employment. Stock options generally expire\nseven years\nfrom the date of grant.\nNo\nstock options were granted during any of the fiscal years presented.\nA summary of stock option activity during Fiscal 2021 is as follows:\n(a)\nAggregate intrinsic value is the amount by which the market price of the Company's Class A common stock at the end of the period exceeds the exercise price of the stock option, multiplied by the number of options.\n(b)\nThere were\nno\nnonvested stock options as of March 27, 2021. Accordingly, there was\nno\nrelated unrecognized compensation expense as of March 27, 2021.\nAdditional information pertaining to the Company's stock option plans is as follows:\n(a)\nAggregate intrinsic value is the amount by which the market price of the Company's Class A common stock exceeded the stock option's exercise price when exercised, multiplied by the number of options.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n19.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe Company sponsors defined contribution benefit plans covering substantially all eligible employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The plans include a savings plan feature under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company makes matching contributions to the plans equal to\n50\n% of the first\n6\n% of salary contributed by an eligible employee. Additionally, the Company makes a supplemental matching contribution for plan years in which the Company achieves an \"above target\" performance level based on certain goals established at the beginning of each fiscal year, increasing the matching contribution to between\n67\n% and\n100\n% depending on the performance level achieved, of the first\n6\n% of salary contributed by eligible employees, not to exceed the maximum contribution permitted by the plan.\nUnder the terms of the plans, a participant becomes 100% vested in the Company's matching contributions after\nfive years\nof credited service. Contributions made by the Company under these plans were $\n9.8\nmillion, $\n8.7\nmillion, and $\n11.2\nmillion in Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020, and Fiscal 2019, respectively.\nInternational Defined Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors certain single-employer defined benefit plans and cash balance plans at international locations which are not considered to be material individually or in the aggregate to the Company's financial statements. Pension benefits under these plans are based on formulas that reflect the employees' years of service and compensation levels during their employment period. The aggregate funded status of the single-employer defined benefit plans reflected net assets of $\n0.7\nmillion and net liabilities of $\n4.0\nmillion as of March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020, respectively, and were primarily recorded within other non-current assets and non-current liabilities, respectively, in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. These single-employer defined benefit plans had aggregate projected benefit obligations of $\n56.1\nmillion and aggregate fair values of plan assets of $\n56.8\nmillion as of March 27, 2021, compared to aggregate projected benefit obligations of $\n52.4\nmillion and aggregate fair values of plan assets of $\n48.4\nmillion as of March 28, 2020. The asset portfolio of the single-employer defined benefit plans primarily consists of fixed income securities, which have been measured at fair value largely using Level 2 inputs, as described in Note 12. Net pension expense for these plans was $\n5.1\nmillion, $\n5.0\nmillion, and $\n4.2\nmillion in Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020, and Fiscal 2019, respectively. The service cost component of $\n5.9\nmillion, $\n4.7\nmillion, and $\n4.4\nmillion in Fiscal 2021, Fiscal 2020, and Fiscal 2019, respectively, was recorded within SG&A expenses in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. All other components of net pension expense during the fiscal years presented were recorded within other income (expense), net, in the Company's consolidated statement of operations.\nUnion Pension Plan\nThe Company participates in a multi-employer pension plan and is required to make contributions to the Workers United union (which was previously known as UNITE HERE) (the \"Union\") for dues based on wages paid to union employees. A portion of these dues is allocated by the Union to a retirement fund which provides defined benefits to substantially all unionized workers. The Company does not participate in the management of the plan and has not been furnished with information with respect to the type of benefits provided, vested and non-vested benefits, or assets.\nUnder the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, an employer, upon withdrawal from or termination of a multi-employer plan, is required to continue funding its proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested benefits. Such liability was assumed in conjunction with the acquisition of certain assets from a non-affiliated licensee. The Company has no current intention of withdrawing from the plan.\nOther Compensation Plans\nThe Company had a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan for certain highly compensated employees whose benefits under the 401(k) profit sharing retirement savings plans were expected to be constrained by the operation of Internal Revenue Code limitations. These supplemental benefits vested over time and the related compensation expense was recognized over the vesting period. Effective August 2008, the Company amended this plan, resulting in a suspension of the annual contributions for substantially all plan participants. Further, affected participants were provided with a one-time election to either withdraw all benefits vested in the plan in a lump sum amount or remain in the plan and receive future distributions of benefits. As of March 27, 2021 and March 28, 2020, amounts accrued under this plan totaled $\n1.9\nmillion and $\n3.4\nmillion, respectively, and were classified within other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Total compensation expense recognized related to these benefits was not material in any of the fiscal years presented.\nRALPH LAUREN CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n20.\nSegment Information\nThe Company has\nthree\nreportable segments based on its business activities and organization:\n•\nNorth America\n— The North America segment primarily consists of sales of Ralph Lauren branded apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, and related products made through the Company's retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S. and Canada, excluding Club Monaco. In North America, the Company's retail business is primarily comprised of its Ralph Lauren stores, its factory stores, and its digital commerce site, www.RalphLauren.com.

In addition, the Company sells its products online through various third-party digital partner commerce sites. The Company's wholesale business in Asia is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, with related products distributed through shop-within-shops.\nNo operating segments were aggregated to form the Company's reportable segments. In addition to these reportable segments, the Company also has other non-reportable segments, which primarily consist of (i) sales of Club Monaco branded products made through its retail and wholesale businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, and its licensing alliances in Europe and Asia, and (ii) royalty revenues earned through its global licensing alliances, excluding Club Monaco. As discussed in Note 9, on May 13, 2021, the Company announced the anticipated sale of its Club Monaco business, which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of Fiscal 2022.\nThe Company's segment reporting structure is consistent with how it establishes its overall business strategy, allocates resources, and assesses performance of its business. The accounting policies of the Company's segments are consistent with those described in Notes 2 and 3. Sales and transfers between segments are generally recorded at cost and treated as transfers of inventory. All intercompany revenues are eliminated in consolidation and are not reviewed when evaluating segment performance. Each segment's performance is evaluated based upon net revenues and operating income before restructuring-related charges, impairment of assets, and certain other one-time items, if any. Certain corporate overhead expenses related to global functions, most notably the Company's executive office, information technology, finance and accounting, human resources, and legal departments, largely remain at corporate.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nNew York, New York\nMay 20, 2021"
