    "text": "Packaging Corporation of America (“we,” “us,” “our,” “PCA,” or the “Company”) is the third largest producer of containerboard products and the third largest producer of uncoated freesheet (UFS) paper in North America. We operate six containerboard mills, two uncoated freesheet (UFS) paper mills, and 90 corrugated products manufacturing plants. We are headquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois and operate primarily in the United States.\nWe report in three reportable segments: Packaging, Paper and Corporate and Other. For segment financial information see Note 19, Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, due to an increase in demand for our corrugated products and as part of our assessment of a potential conversion to produce containerboard, we began producing high-performance, virgin kraft linerboard on the No. 3 machine at our Jackson, Alabama mill on a trial basis. Before October 2020, operating results for the Jackson mill were included in the Paper segment. Beginning in October 2020, operating results for the Jackson mill are included in both the Packaging and Paper segments.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, we discontinued the production of paper grades at the Wallula, Washington mill and converted the No. 3 machine to production of virgin kraft linerboard. Before May 2018, operating results for the Wallula mill were included in the Paper segment. After May 2018, operating results for the Wallula mill are primarily included in the Packaging segment.\nProduction and Shipments\nThe following table summarizes the Packaging segment's containerboard production and corrugated products shipments and the Paper segment's UFS production.\n2\nBelow is a map of our locations:\nPackaging\nPackaging Products\nOur containerboard mills produce linerboard and corrugating medium, which are primarily used in the production of corrugated products. Our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products, including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods, multi-color boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations, and honeycomb protective packaging. In addition, we are a large producer of packaging for meat, fresh fruit and vegetables, processed food, beverages, and other industrial and consumer products.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, our Packaging segment produced 4.3 million tons of containerboard at our mills. Our corrugated products manufacturing plants sold 62.8 billion square feet (BSF) of corrugated products. The Packaging segment’s net sales to third parties totaled $5.9 billion in 2020.\n3\nFacilities\nWe manufacture containerboard, which includes a variety of performance and specialty grades, at six\ncontainerboard mills. Total annual containerboard capacity was approximately 4.3 million tons as of December 31, 2020. We also produce corrugated and protective packaging products at 90 manufacturing locations. The following provides more details of our operations:\nCounce.\nOur Counce, Tennessee mill produces kraft linerboard on two machines. The mill can produce basis weights from 26 lb. to 90 lb.\nDeRidder.\nOur DeRidder, Louisiana mill produces kraft linerboard on its No. 1 machine and kraft linerboard and corrugating medium on its No. 2 machine. The mill can produce linerboard in basis weights of 26 lb. to 69 lb. and medium in basis weights of 23 lb. to 33 lb.\nValdosta.\nOur Valdosta, Georgia mill produces kraft linerboard on one machine. The mill can produce basis weights from 35 lb. to 96 lb.\nTomahawk.\nOur Tomahawk, Wisconsin mill produces corrugating medium on two machines. The mill can produce basis weights from 23 lb. to 47 lb.\nFiler City.\nOur Filer City, Michigan mill produces corrugating medium on three machines. The mill can produce basis weights from\n20 lb. to 47 lb.\nWallula.\nOur Wallula, Washington mill produces corrugating medium on its No. 2 machine and kraft linerboard on its No. 3 machine. The mill can produce medium in basis weights from 23 lb. to 33 lb. and linerboard in basis weights from 31 lb. to 52 lb.\nWe operate 90 corrugated manufacturing and protective packaging operations, a technical and development center, 10 regional design centers, a rotogravure printing operation, and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers.\nOf the 90 manufacturing facilities, 58 operate as combining operations, commonly called corrugated plants, which manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated packaging products, 31 are sheet plants, which procure combined sheets and manufacture finished corrugated packaging products, and one is a corrugated sheet-only manufacturer.\nCorrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs. Each of our plants serve a market radius of approximately 150 miles. Our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants, which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items.\nMajor Raw Materials Used\nFiber supply.\nFiber is the largest raw material cost to manufacture containerboard. We consume both wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills. Our mill system has the capability to shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood, hardwood, and recycled sources. All of our mills can utilize virgin wood fiber and all of our mills, other than the Valdosta mill, can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production. Our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a by-product from the manufacturing process, which is consumed by our mills. In 2020, our usage of recycled fiber, net of internal generation, represents 17% of our containerboard production.\nWe procure wood fiber through leases of cutting rights, long-term supply agreements, and market purchases and believe we have adequate sources of fiber supply for the foreseeable future.\nWe participate in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative\n®\n(SFI), the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), as well as the Forest Stewardship Council\n®\n(FSC\n®\n), and we are certified under their sourcing and chain of custody standards. These standards are aimed at ensuring the long-term health and conservation of forestry resources. We are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics.\n4\nEnergy supply.\nEnergy at our packaging mills is obtained through\nself-generated or\npurchased fuels and electricity. Fuel sources include\nby-products of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process (including black liquor and wood waste), natural gas,\npurchased wood waste, and other purchased fuels. Each of our mills self-generates process steam requirements from by-products (black liquor and wood waste), as well as from the various purchased fuels. The process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity.\nIn 2020, our packaging mills consumed about 74 million MMBTUs of fuel to produce both steam and electricity. Of the 74 million MMBTUs consumed, about 63% was from mill generated by-products and 37% was from purchased fuels. Of the purchased fuels, 78% was from natural gas, 20% was from purchased wood waste and 2% was from other purchased fuels.\nChemical supply.\nWe consume various chemicals in the production of containerboard, including caustic soda, sulfuric acid, soda ash, and lime. Most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts, which are bid or negotiated periodically.\nSales, Marketing, and Distribution\nOur corrugated products are sold through our direct sales and marketing organization, independent brokers, and distribution partners. We have sales representatives and a sales manager at most of our corrugated manufacturing operations and also have corporate account managers who serve customer accounts with a national presence. Additionally, our design centers maintain an on-site dedicated graphics sales force. In addition to direct sales and marketing personnel, we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists. These individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the design centers. General marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters.\nOur containerboard sales group is responsible for linerboard and corrugating medium order processing and sales to our corrugated plants, to outside domestic customers, and to export customers. These personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers.\nContainerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck. Our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service. Our corrugated manufacturing operations typically serve customers within a 150-mile radius. We sometimes use third-party warehouses for short-term storage of corrugated products.\nCustomers\nWe sell containerboard and corrugated products to approximately 16,000 customers in approximately 33,000 locations. About 70% of our corrugated products sales are to regional and local accounts, which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations. The remaining 30% of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts that have multiple locations and are served by a number of PCA plants. No single customer exceeds 10% of segment sales.\nThe primary end-use markets in the United States for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the 2019 Fibre Box Association annual report:\nCompetition\nAs of December 31, 2020, we were the third largest producer of containerboard products in North America, according to industry sources and our own estimates. According to industry sources, corrugated products are produced by about 450 U.S. companies operating approximately 1,200 plants. The primary basis for competition for most of our packaging products includes quality, service, price, product design, and innovation. Most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer’s specifications. Corrugated producers generally sell within a 150-mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local region. Competition in our corrugated products operations tends to be regional, although we also face competition from competitors with significant national account presence.\n5\nOn a national level, our primary competitors are International Paper Company, WestRock Company, Georgia-Pacific LLC, and Pratt Industries.\nHowever, with our strategic focus on regional and local accounts, we also compete with the smaller,\nlocal\nproducers.\nPaper\nWe are the third largest manufacturer of UFS in North America, according to industry sources and our own estimates. We manufacture and sell papers, including both commodity and specialty papers, which may have custom or specialized features such as colors, coatings, high brightness, and recycled content. Our papers consist of communication papers, including cut-size office papers, and printing and converting papers.\nFacilities\nWe currently have two paper mills located in the United States. Total annual UFS capacity is 964,000 tons. Our operations include the following:\nJackson.\nOur Jackson, Alabama mill produces both commodity and specialty papers on two paper machines.\nInternational Falls.\nOur International Falls, Minnesota mill produces both commodity and specialty papers on two paper machines.\nMajor Raw Materials Used\nFiber supply.\nFiber is the largest raw material cost in this segment. We consume wood fiber, recycled fiber, and purchased pulp. Our Jackson mill purchases recycled fiber to produce our line of recycled office papers. We purchase wood fiber through contracts and open-market purchase, and we purchase recycled fiber and pulp from third parties pursuant to contractual agreements.\nWe participate in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative\n®\n(SFI), the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), as well as the Forest Stewardship Council\n®\n(FSC\n®\n), and we are certified under their sourcing and chain of custody standards. These standards are aimed at ensuring the long-term health and conservation of forestry resources. We are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics.\nEnergy supply.\nWe obtain energy through self-generated or purchased fuels and electricity. Fuel sources include by-products of the manufacturing and pulping process (including black liquor and wood waste), natural gas, electricity, and purchased wood waste. Each of the paper mills self-generates process steam requirements from by-products (black liquor and wood waste), as well as from the various purchased fuels. The process steam is used throughout the production process and to generate electricity.\nIn 2020, our paper mills consumed about 19 million MMBTUs of fuel to produce both steam and electricity. Of the 19 million MMBTUs consumed, about 75% was from mill generated by-products and 25% was from purchased fuels. Of the purchased fuels, 89% was from natural gas and 11% from purchased wood waste.\nChemical supply.\nWe consume various chemicals in the production of white papers, including starch, precipitated calcium carbonate, caustic soda, and sodium chlorate. Most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts, which are bid or negotiated periodically.\nSales, Marketing, and Distribution\nOur papers are sold primarily through our sales and marketing organization. We ship to customers both directly from our mills and through distribution centers and a network of outside warehouses by rail or truck. This allows us to respond quickly to customer requirements.\nCustomers\nWe have over 100 customers in approximately 400 locations. These customers include office products distributors and retailers, paper merchants, and envelope and other converters. We have established long-term relationships with many of our\n6\ncustomers. Office Depot, Inc. is our largest customer in the Paper segment.\nEffective January 1, 2020, we have a revised agreement with Office Depot in which we will continue to supply commodity and non-commodity office papers to Office Depot through December 31, 2022. Office Depot is not subject to a minimum volume commitment and is entitled to receive rebates for achieving certain volume thresholds. If the agreement is not renewed by the parties, Office Depot’s obligation to purchase paper would phase down over a two-year period beginning on January 1, 2023.\nIn\n2020\n, our sales revenu\ne to Office Depot\nrepresented\n45\n% of our Paper segment sales revenue\nand\n5\n% of our\nconsolidated sales revenue\n.\nCompetition\nThe markets in which our Paper segment competes are large and highly competitive. Commodity grades of UFS paper are globally traded, with numerous worldwide manufacturers, and as a result, these products compete primarily on the basis of price. All of our paper manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, and although we compete primarily in the domestic market, we do face competition from foreign producers. In 2016, as a result of a case brought by us and other domestic producers before United States international trade authorities, antidumping and countervailing duties at various levels were imposed on producers of uncoated freesheet papers produced in Australia, Brazil, China, Indonesia, and Portugal. These duties remain in effect and are subject to review in 2021. Other factors influencing competition from overseas producers include domestic and foreign demand and foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur largest competitors include Domtar Corporation and International Paper Company. We also face competition from foreign producers. Although price is the primary basis for competition in most of our paper grades, quality and service are also important competitive determinants. Our papers compete with electronic data transmission, e-readers, electronic document storage alternatives, and paper grades we do not produce. Increasing shifts to these alternatives have had, and are likely to continue to have, an adverse effect on traditional print media and paper usage and lower demand for communication papers.\nCorporate and Other\nOur Corporate and Other segment includes corporate support staff services and related assets and liabilities. This segment also includes transportation assets, such as rail cars and trucks, which we use to transport some of our products to and from our manufacturing sites, and assets related to a 50% owned variable interest entity, Louisiana Timber Procurement Company, L.L.C. (LTP).\nHuman Capital\nPCA’s success depends on a highly engaged, results-oriented workforce operating in an entrepreneurial culture. Our primary objective is to place the right people in the right roles, and empower them to succeed.\nSafety is a core value at PCA and we believe that all accidents are preventable and an injury-free environment is achievable. We have implemented a robust occupational health and safety management system to assure accountability throughout the organization for safe work practices. Key components to our system include commitment from management, extensive training of employees, hazard identification and communication and regular safety audits.\nDuring 2020, we were committed to conducting safe operations through the COVID-19 pandemic in accordance with the guidelines of the Center for Disease Control and applicable health and safety regulations. As PCA’s operations continued to operate as “essential businesses,” we adopted measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, including social distancing practices, health screening procedures, enhanced sanitation procedures and enhanced absence pay policies. These practices will continue into 2021 as the effects of the pandemic continue. PCA did not experience significant disruptions in its operations as a result of the pandemic and has maintained adequate availability of its workforce and supply of raw materials and services to continue to serve its customers.\nWe have extensive recruiting, training and development programs designed to attract and retain a highly talented workforce aligned with our objectives to relentlessly serve our customers and achieve operational excellence throughout our organization. As demand for qualified personnel is increasing, we are expanding our efforts in these critical areas along with efforts to continue to develop, promote and maintain a diverse workforce with a culture and an environment of respect and inclusion. These principles are designed to develop and promote strong and increasing engagement of all PCA employees.\n7\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 15,200 employees, including 4,500 salaried and 10,700 hourly employees. Approximately 62% of our hourly employees worked pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. The\nmajority of our unionized employees are represented by the United Steel Workers (USW), the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), the International Association of Machinists (IAM), and the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers (AWPPW). We are currently in negotiations to renew or extend union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future. During 2020, we experienced no work stoppages, and we believe we have satisfactory labor relations with our employees.\nRegulatory and Environmental Matters\nA discussion of the financial impact of our compliance with environmental laws is presented under the caption “Regulatory and Environmental Matters” in “Part II, Item 7.

    "text": "Some of the statements in this report and, in particular, statements found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, that are not historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements about our expectations regarding our future liquidity, earnings, expenditures, and financial condition. These statements are often identified by the words “will,” “should,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “hope,” or similar expressions. These statements reflect management’s current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. There are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond our control. These factors, risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors described below.\nOur actual results, performance, or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements, and accordingly, we can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so, what impact they will have on our results of operations or financial condition. In view of these uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly revise or otherwise update any forward-looking statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of events after the date hereof.\nIn addition to the risks and uncertainties we discuss elsewhere in this Form 10-K (particularly in “Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”) or in our other filings with the\n9\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we project in any forward-looking statement.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe future effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations is uncertain.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Since that time, federal, state and local authorities have taken measures to control the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States, where we primarily operate. These measures have included\ntravel bans and restrictions, quarantines and shelter in place orders. Due to the importance of our products to the continued distribution of food, beverage and other necessities, our operating facilities have been permitted to remain in operation and we have not experienced material disruptions in operations to date. Despite the spread of the virus in the United States, we have maintained sufficient workforce availability as well as adequate supply of raw materials and necessary services to continue operating without material disruption. However, the impact of the further spread of the virus and the measures to control the spread of the virus are uncertain and may materially restrict or hinder our ability to operate our facilities due to measures we may need to take to assure the health and safety of our employees, lack of available workforce, disruptions in the supply of key materials and services or restrictions due to governmental actions. We cannot assure you as to the timing and effectiveness of vaccination efforts on the control of spread of the virus. If our operations are hindered or restricted, we may not be able to serve our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe pandemic resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, and measures to control the outbreak, are having a negative impact on domestic economic activity, which could adversely affect demand for our products and our business, financial condition and results of operations\n.\nMany businesses in the United States have been required to cease or curtail operations and workers have been laid off or furloughed, and have slowed down economic activity. The severity and duration of the impact on the economy will depend on the future spread of the outbreak, future measures by governmental authorities to control the outbreak, the timing and effectiveness of vaccination efforts, the timing and manner in which normal social and business activities are permitted to resume and the effectiveness of governmental efforts to mitigate the economic effect of the outbreak, all of which are highly uncertain.\nWe have experienced significantly lower demand for our uncoated freesheet paper products, due to economic conditions, office closings and school shutdowns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which harmed the performance of our Paper segment. Our Jackson, Alabama mill was idled for the majority of the second and third quarters of 2020 and began to produce containerboard for the Packaging segment on a trial basis during the fourth quarter. While we have not experienced lower demand for our containerboard and corrugated packaging products to date, the effect of the pandemic on economic conditions affecting our business and future demand is uncertain.\nI\nt is uncertain whether, to what extent and for what period of time current favorable demand conditions in the Packaging segment will continue. With the uncertainty of economic conditions, we are unable to determine the impact on our future operating and financial performance. A prolonged period of lower earnings and reduced cash flow could adversely affect our ability to fund operations, capital requirements, and common stock dividend payments and access capital markets.\nRisks Related to our Operations, Business and Industry\nIndustry Cyclicality - Changes in the prices of our products could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nMacroeconomic conditions and fluctuations in industry capacity can create changes in prices, sales volumes, and margins for most of our products, particularly commodity grades of packaging and paper products. Prices for all of our products are driven by many factors, including demand for our products, industry capacity and decisions made by other producers with respect to capacity and production, and other competitive conditions in our industry. These factors are affected by general global and domestic economic conditions. We have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes of our products, which may be unpredictable and volatile. In addition, as many of our customer contracts include price adjustment provisions based upon published index prices for containerboard or certain grades of UFS papers, our selling prices are influenced by index levels published by trade publications. Changes in how these index levels are determined or maintained may affect our sales prices. If supply exceeds demand, industry operating conditions deteriorate or other factors result in lower prices for our products, our earnings and operating cash flows would be harmed.\nCompetition - The intensity of competition in the industries in which we operate could result in downward pressure on pricing and volume, which could lower earnings and operating cash flows.\nOur industries are highly competitive, with no single containerboard, corrugated packaging, or UFS paper producer having a dominant position. Containerboard and commodity UFS paper products cannot generally be differentiated by producer, which tends to intensify price competition. The corrugated packaging industry is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions, as well as other factors including innovation,\n10\ndesign, quality, and service. To the extent that one or more competitors are more successful than we are with respect to any key competitive factor, our business could be adversely affected. Our packaging products also compete, to some extent, with various other packaging materials, including products made of paper, plastics, wood, and various types of metal. If we are unable to successfully compete, we may lose market share or may be required to charge lower sales prices for our products, both of which would reduce our earnings and operating cash flows.\nUFS paper products compete with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives. Increasing shifts to electronic alternatives have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on usage of these products. As a result of such competition, the industry is experiencing decreasing demand for existing UFS paper products. As the use of these alternatives grows, demand for UFS paper products is likely to further decline. Declines in demand for our paper products may adversely affect our earnings and operating cash flows.\nSome of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources, greater manufacturing economies of scale, greater energy self-sufficiency, or lower operating costs, compared to our company. We may be unable to compete effectively with these companies particularly during economic downturns. Some of the factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete in the markets in which we participate include the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve, increased competition from overseas producers, our competitors' pricing strategies, changes in customer preferences, and the cost-efficiency of our facilities.\nCost of Fiber - An increase in the cost of fiber could increase our manufacturing costs and lower our earnings.\nThe market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability, source, and the costs of fuels used in the harvesting and transportation of wood fiber. The cost and availability of wood fiber can also be impacted by weather, general logging conditions, geography, and regulatory activity.\nThe availability and cost of recycled fiber depends heavily on recycling rates and the domestic and global demand for recycled products. We purchase recycled fiber for use at five of our six containerboard mills and both paper mills. In 2020, we purchased approximately 725,000 tons of recycled fiber, net of the recycled fiber generated by our corrugated box plants. The amount of recycled fiber purchased each year varies based upon production and the prices of both recycled fiber and wood fiber.\nPeriods of supply and demand imbalance have created significant price volatility. Periods of higher recycled fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past, including during 2020 as demand for domestic recycled fiber from Chinese producers continued to remain low. Prices for recycled fiber may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, which could result in higher costs and lower earnings. A $10 per ton price increase in recycled fiber for our containerboard mills would result in approximately $7 million of additional expense based on 2020 consumption.\nCost of Purchased Fuels and Chemicals - An increase in the cost of purchased fuels and chemicals could lead to higher manufacturing costs, resulting in reduced earnings.\nWe have the ability to use various types of purchased fuels in our manufacturing operations, including natural gas, bark, and other purchased fuels. Fuel prices, in particular prices for oil and natural gas, have fluctuated in the past. New and more stringent environmental regulations may discourage, reduce the availability of, or make more expensive, the use of certain fuels, particularly coal and fossil fuels. In addition, costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing operations also fluctuate. These fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in earnings volatility. If fuel and chemical prices rise, our production costs and transportation costs will increase and cause higher manufacturing costs and reduced earnings if we are unable to recover such increases through higher prices of our products. A $0.10 per million MMBTU increase in natural gas prices would result in approximately $3 million of additional expense, based on 2020 usage.\nCustomer Concentration - We rely on certain large customers.\nOur packaging and paper segments each have large customers, the loss of which could adversely affect the segment’s sales and profitability. In particular, because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments, we regularly bid for new business or for renewal of existing business. The loss of business from our larger customers, or the renewal of business on less favorable terms, may adversely impact our financial results.\nOffice Depot, Inc. is our largest customer in the Paper segment. Effective January 1, 2020, we have a revised agreement with Office Depot in which we will continue to supply commodity and non-commodity office papers to Office Depot through December 31, 2022. Office Depot is not subject to a minimum volume commitment and is entitled to receive rebates for achieving certain volume thresholds. If the agreement is not renewed by the parties, Office Depot’s obligation to purchase paper would phase down over a two-year period beginning on January 1, 2023.\n11\nIn\n2020\n, sale\ns to Office Depot represented\n45% of our Paper segment sales and 5% of\nour consolidated sales. If t\nhese sales are reduced, including if we are unable to renew the agreement at historical volume levels, we would need to find new customers. We may not be able to fully replace any lost sales, and any new sales may be at lower prices or higher costs. Any significant deterioration in the financial condition of Office Depot affecting its ability to pay or any other change that makes Office Depot less willing to purchase our products will harm our business and results of operations.\nTransportation Costs - Reduced truck and rail availability could lead to higher costs or poorer service, resulting in lower earnings, and harm our ability to distribute our products.\nWe ship our products primarily by truck and rail. We have experienced lower availability of third-party trucking services and service issues, interruptions, and delays in rail services. We have also experienced higher costs for transportation services in general. If these factors persist, we could experience even higher transportation costs in the future and difficulties shipping our products in a timely manner. We may not be able to recover higher transportation costs through higher prices or otherwise, which would result in lower earnings.\nMaterial Disruption of Manufacturing - A material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales, and/or negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends on continuous operation of our facilities, particularly at our mills. Any of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our machines within such facilities, could cease operations unexpectedly for a significant period of time due to a number of events, including:\nThese events could harm our ability to produce our products and serve our customers and may lead to higher costs and reduced earnings.\nReliance on Personnel\n- We may fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, including key management personnel.\nOur ability to operate and grow our business depends on our ability to attract and retain employees with the skills necessary to operate and maintain our facilities, produce our products and serve our customers. The increasing demand for qualified personnel may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may make it difficult for us to replace retiring employees at our manufacturing and other facilities. If we fail to attract and retain qualified personnel, or if we experience labor shortages, we may experience higher costs and other difficulties, and our business may be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively. As our business has grown in size and geographic scope, we have relied on these individuals to manage increasingly complex operations. The loss of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nCyber Security - Risks related to security breaches of company, customer, employee, and vendor information, as well as the technology that manages our operations and other business processes, could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on various information technology systems to capture, process, store, and report data and interact with customers, vendors, and employees. Despite careful security and controls design, implementation, updating, and internal and independent third-party assessments, our information technology systems, and those of our third party providers, could become subject to cyber-attacks or security breaches. Network, system, and data breaches could result in misappropriation of sensitive data or operational\n12\ndisruptions including interruption to systems availability and denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us. Misuse of internal applications; theft of intellectual property, trade secrets, or other corporate assets; and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could stem from such incidents. Delayed sales, slowed production, or other issues resulting from these disruptions could result in lost sales, business delays, and negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, or operating cash flows.\nEnvironmental Matters - PCA may incur significant environmental liabilities with respect to both past and future operations.\nWe are subject to, and must comply with, a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws, particularly those relating to air and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines, which may be significant, or other adverse regulatory action. Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with those laws. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters” for estimates of expenditures we expect to make for environmental compliance in the next few years. New and more stringent environmental regulations may be adopted and may require us to incur additional operating expenses and/or significant additional capital expenditures to modify or replace certain of our boilers and other equipment. In addition, environmental regulations may increase the cost of our raw materials and purchased energy. Although we have established reserves to provide for known environmental liabilities, these reserves may change over time due to the enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, which might require additional significant environmental expenditures.\nLabor Relations- If we experience strikes or other work stoppages, our business will be harmed.\nOur workforce is highly unionized and operates under various collective bargaining agreements. We must negotiate to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future. While we believe that we have satisfactory labor relations, we may not be able to successfully negotiate new agreements without work stoppages or labor difficulties in the future or renegotiate them on favorable terms. If we are unable to successfully renegotiate the terms of any of these agreements, or if we experience any extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of strikes or other work stoppages, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\nFinancial Risks\nGeneral Economic Conditions\n- If business, political, and economic conditions change in an adverse manner, our business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial position may be harmed.\nGeneral global and domestic economic conditions directly affect the levels of demand and production of consumer goods, levels of employment, the availability and cost of credit, and ultimately, the profitability of our business. If economic conditions deteriorate and result in higher unemployment rates, lower disposable income, unfavorable currency exchange rates, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment, and lower consumer spending, we may experience lower demand for our products, which is largely driven by demand for products of our customers which utilize our products. If economic conditions result in higher inflation, we may experience higher production and transportation costs, which we may not be able to recover through higher prices or otherwise. In addition, changes in trade policy, including renegotiating or potentially terminating existing bilateral or multilateral agreements as well as the imposition of tariffs, could impact global markets and demand for our and our customers’ products and the costs associated with certain of our capital investments. Further changes in tax laws or tax rates may have a material impact on our future cash taxes, effective tax rate or deferred tax assets and liabilities. These conditions are beyond our control and may have a material impact on our business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial position.\nInflation and Other General Cost Increases - We may not be able to offset higher costs\n. We are subject to both contractual, inflationary, and other general cost increases, including with regard to our labor costs and purchases of raw materials and transportation services. General economic conditions may result in higher inflation, which may increase our exposure to higher costs. If we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases, growth, and/or cost reductions in our operations, these inflationary and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows, profitability, and liquidity.\nIn 2020, our total company costs including cost of sales (COS) and selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) was $5.8 billion, and excluding non-cash costs (depreciation, depletion and amortization, pension and postretirement expense, and share-based compensation expense) was $5.4 billion. A 1% increase in COS and SG&A costs would increase costs by $58 million and cash costs by $54 million.\n13\nDebt obligations - Our debt service obligations may reduce our operating flexibility.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had\n$2.5 billion\nof debt outstanding and a\n$326.3 million\nu\nndrawn revolving credit facility, after deducting letters of credit. All debt is comprised of fixed-rate senior notes. We and our subsidiaries are not restricted from incurring, and may incur, additional indebtedness in the future.\nOur current borrowings, plus any future borrowings, may affect our ability to operate our business, including, without limitation:\nFurther, if we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions to secure additional cash by selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing investments, which may not be achievable on acceptable terms or at all.\nPension Plans – Our pension plans may require additional funding.\nWe record a liability associated with our pensions equal to the excess of the benefit obligations over the fair value of the assets funding the plans. The actual required amounts and timing of future cash contributions will be sensitive to changes in the applicable discount rates and returns on plan assets, and could also be impacted by future changes in the laws and regulations applicable to plan funding. Fluctuations in the market performance of our plan assets will affect our pension plan costs in future periods. Changes in assumptions regarding expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, our discount rate, expected compensation levels, or mortality will also increase or decrease pension costs.\nMarket Price of our Common Stock\n- The market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of the stock to decline.\nSecurities markets worldwide periodically experience significant price declines and volume fluctuations due to macroeconomic factors and other factors beyond our control. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market, or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock with little regard to our operating performance. In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, and in response, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly."

This discussion includes forward-looking statements regarding our expectations with respect to our future performance, liquidity, and capital resources. Such statements, along with any other non-historical statements in the discussion, are forward-looking. See our discussion regarding forward-looking statements included under “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K. For our discussion and analysis of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018, the earliest of the years presented in the accompanying audited financial statements included in Item 8 herein, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 26, 2020. Such information is presented in Item 7 of such report under the subcaptions “Results of Operations —Year Ended December 31, 2019, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and is incorporated by reference herein.\nOverview\nPCA is the third largest producer of containerboard products and the third largest producer of uncoated freesheet paper in North America. We operate six containerboard mills, two paper mills, and 90 corrugated products manufacturing plants. Our containerboard mills produce linerboard and corrugating medium, which are papers primarily used in the production of corrugated products. Our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products, including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods, multi-color boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations, and honeycomb protective packaging. In addition, we are a large producer of packaging for meat, fresh fruit and vegetables, processed food, beverages, and other industrial and consumer products. We also manufacture and sell UFS papers, including both commodity and specialty papers, which may have custom or specialized features such as colors, coatings, high brightness, and recycled content. We are headquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois and operate primarily in the United States.\nExecutive Summary\nNet sales were $6.66 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $6.96 billion in 2019. We reported $461 million of net income, or $4.84 per diluted share, in 2020, compared to $696 million, or $7.34 per diluted share, in 2019. Net income included $89 million of expense for special items in 2020, compared to $29 million of expense for special items in 2019. Special items in both periods are described later in this section. Excluding special items, we recorded $550 million of net income, or $5.78 per diluted share, in 2020, compared to $726 million, or $7.65 per diluted share, in 2019. The decrease was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our Packaging and Paper segments, lower volumes in our Paper segment, higher freight and logistic expense, and higher annual outage expense, partially offset by higher volumes in our Packaging segment, and lower operating and converting costs. For additional detail on special items included in reported GAAP results, as well as segment income (loss) excluding special items, earnings before non-operating pension expense, interest, income taxes, and depreciation, amortization, and depletion (EBITDA), and EBITDA excluding special items, see “Item 7. Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Reported Amounts.” PCA ended the year with $1.1 billion of cash and marketable debt securities and, including borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility, $1.4 billion in liquidity.\nThe Company was committed to conducting safe operations through the COVID-19 pandemic during the year in adherence with the guidelines of the Center for Disease Control and applicable health and safety regulations. As PCA’s operations continued to operate as “essential businesses,” we adopted measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, including social distancing practices, enhanced sanitation procedures and modified absence pay policies. These practices will continue into 2021 as the effects of the pandemic continue. PCA did not experience significant disruptions in its operations as a result of the pandemic and has maintained adequate availability of its workforce and supply of raw materials and services to continue to serve its customers.\nPackaging segment income from operations was $830 million in 2020, compared to $963 million in 2019. Packaging segment EBITDA excluding special items was $1,229 million in 2020, compared to $1,310 million in 2019. The decrease was driven primarily by lower containerboard and corrugated prices and mix, partially offset by higher sales and production volumes, lower operating and converting costs, lower annual outage expense, and lower freight and logistic expenses.\nDemand for Packaging segment products remained strong throughout the year, with our corrugated products shipments up 5.8% over 2019 (an increase of 5.4% on a per day basis as 2020 had one more operating day than 2019) and is expected to remain strong into the first quarter of 2021. We notified our customers of increased prices on our containerboard and corrugated products\n19\nduring the fourth quarter of 2020\n. We expect to incur some inflation in freight, labor, energy and fiber costs into the first quarter of 2021.\nPaper segment loss from operations was $20 million in 2020, compared to income of $175 million in 2019. Paper segment EBITDA excluding special items was $73 million in 2020, compared to $213 million in 2019. The decrease was due primarily to lower sales and production volumes, lower paper prices and mix, higher annual outage expense, and higher freight and logistic expenses, partially offset by lower operating costs. Sales were 30% lower than last year, as demand for our paper products has continued to be negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to office and school closures. As described in Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we incurred a charge of $55.2 million during the year associated with the full impairment of goodwill within the Paper segment.\nOperations at our Jackson, Alabama mill were idled for the majority of the second and third quarters of 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, due to an increase in demand for our corrugated products and as part of our assessment of a potential conversion to produce containerboard, we began producing high-performance, virgin kraft linerboard on the No. 3 machine at our Jackson mill. Before October 2020, operating results for the Jackson mill were included in the Paper segment. Beginning in October 2020, operating results for the Jackson mill are included in both the Packaging and Paper segments. We expect to continue to produce containerboard on the Jackson machine during the first quarter of 2021 to fulfill the needs of our packaging customers, as well as produce uncoated freesheet to service our paper customers.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, the Company discontinued production of paper grades at its Wallula, Washington mill and converted the No. 3 paper machine to a virgin kraft linerboard machine. The Company incurred charges in the Packaging and Paper segments relating to these activities during 2019 as described below under “Special Items and Earnings per Diluted Share, Excluding Special Items.”\nSpecial Items and Earnings per Diluted Share, Excluding Special Items\nEarnings per diluted share, excluding special items, in 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n20\nManagement excludes special items, as it believes these items are not necessarily reflective of the ongoing results of operations of our business. We present these measures because they provide a means to evaluate the performance of our segments and our company on an ongoing basis using the same measures that are used by our management, because these measures assist in providing a meaningful comparison between periods presented and because these measures are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies and the performance of their segments. A reconciliation of diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share excluding special items is included above and the reconciliations of other non-GAAP measures used in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with GAAP, are included later in Item 7 under “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Reported Amounts.” Any analysis of non-GAAP financial measures should be done in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures are not intended to be substitutes for GAAP financial measures and should not be used as such.\nIndustry and Business Conditions\nTrade publications reported North American industry-wide corrugated products shipments per workday were up 3.0% during 2020, compared to 2019. Reported industry containerboard production increased 3.6% compared to 2019, and reported industry containerboard inventories at the end of 2020 were approximately 2.3 million tons, down 8.9% compared to 2019. Reported containerboard export shipments increased 9.0% compared to 2019. Prices reported by trade publications decreased by $10 per ton for linerboard and $15 per ton for corrugating medium in January 2020, followed by a $50 per ton increase in linerboard and medium in November 2020.\nThe market for communication papers competes heavily with electronic data transmission and document storage alternatives. Increasing shifts to these alternatives have reduced usage of traditional print media and communication papers. Trade publications reported North American uncoated freesheet paper shipments were down 20.1% in 2020, compared to 2019. Average copy paper prices reported by a trade publication for cut size office papers decreased $15 per ton in May 2020 and $20 per ton in June 2020.\n21\nResults of\nOperations\nYear Ended December 31, 2020, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe historical results of operations of PCA for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are set forth below (dollars in millions):\nNet Sales\nNet sales decreased $306 million, or 4.4%, to $6,658 million in 2020, compared to $6,964 million in 2019.\nPackaging.\nNet sales decreased $13 million, or 0.2%, to $5,919 million, compared to $5,932 million in 2019, due to lower prices and mix ($298 million), partially offset by increased volumes ($285 million), primarily due to strong corrugated products demand and shipments. In 2020, our domestic containerboard prices decreased 5.9% and export prices decreased 11.5% compared to 2019. Our containerboard outside shipments decreased 5.8%, and total corrugated products shipments were up 5.8% in total and 5.4% per workday, compared to 2019. Prices reported by trade publications, which serve as an index for prices for our corrugated products in many of our customer contracts, decreased by $10 per ton for linerboard and $15 per ton for corrugating medium in January, followed by a $50 per ton increase in linerboard and medium in November 2020.\nPaper.\nNet sales decreased $289 million, or 30.0%, to $675 million, compared to $964 million in 2019. The decrease was due to lower volume ($262 million) and prices and mix ($27 million), as demand was harmed by the COVID-19 pandemic due to office and school closures.\nGross Profit\nGross profit decreased $275 million in 2020, compared to 2019. The decrease was driven primarily by lower prices and mix in our Packaging and Paper segments, lower volumes in our Paper segment, higher freight and logistic expense, and higher annual outage expense, partially offset by higher volumes in our Packaging segment, and lower operating and converting costs.  In 2020, gross profit included $21 million of special item expense related to the impact of Hurricane Laura at our DeRidder, Louisiana mill, incremental out-of-pocket costs related to COVID-19, and facility closure costs, compared to no significant special items in 2019.\n22\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) decreased $18 million in 2020, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower travel and entertainment expenses and lower administrative and other corporate costs, partially offset by higher employee salaries and fringes.\nGoodwill Impairment\nDuring 2020, with the exacerbated deterioration in uncoated freesheet market conditions and the estimated impact on our Paper reporting unit arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as projected future results of operations, we identified a triggering event indicating possible impairment of goodwill within our Paper reporting unit. The Company performed an interim quantitative impairment analysis as of May 31, 2020, and, based on the evaluation performed, we determined that goodwill was fully impaired for the Paper reporting unit and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $55 million. For more information, see Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, of the Condensed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements” of this Form 10-K.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are set forth below (dollars in millions):\nWe discuss these items in more detail in Note 6, Other Expense, Net of the Condensed Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements” of this Form 10-K.\nIncome from Operations\nIncome from operations decreased $330 million, or 31.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019. Income from operations in 2020 included $100 million of expense for special items compared to $4 million in 2019. Special items in 2020 consisted of $55 million of expense for the Paper reporting unit goodwill impairment; $28 million of restructuring costs for paper administrative functions and closure costs related to corrugated products facilities; $10 million related to the impact of Hurricane Laura at our DeRidder, Louisiana mill; and $7 million of incremental, out-of-pocket costs related to COVID-19 that were incurred in the first half of 2020.\n2019 special items included $3 million of charges for the disposal of fixed assets related to the containerboard mill conversion at our DeRidder, Louisiana mill and $1 million of charges related to the conversion of the Wallula, Washington mill No. 3 paper machine.\nPackaging.\nSegment income from operations decreased $134 million to $829 million, compared to $963 million in 2019. The decrease in 2020 related primarily to lower containerboard and corrugated products prices and mix ($246 million) and higher depreciation expense ($14 million), partially offset by higher containerboard and corrugated products sales and production volumes ($90 million), lower operating and converting costs ($55 million), lower annual outage expense ($5 million), lower freight expense ($4 million) and other fixed costs ($10 million). Special items in 2020 included expense of $27 million of closure costs for corrugated products facilities, $10 million of charges related to the impact of Hurricane Laura at our DeRidder, Louisiana mill, and $6 million of incremental, out-of-pocket costs related to COVID-19. Special items in 2019 included $3 million for the disposal of fixed assets related to the containerboard mill conversion at our DeRidder, Louisiana mill and $1 million of charges related to the conversion of the Wallula No. 3 paper machine.\nPaper.\nSegment income from operations decreased $195 million to a loss of $20 million, compared to income of $175 million in 2019. The decrease primarily related to lower sales and production volumes ($130 million), lower paper prices and mix ($27 million), higher annual outage expense ($11 million), and higher freight expense ($11 million), partially offset by lower operating costs ($39 million), and lower depreciation expense ($1 million). Special items in the Paper segment in 2020 included $55 million related to goodwill impairment, $1 million of restructuring costs for paper administrative functions, and $1 million of incremental, out-of-pocket costs related to COVID-19, compared to an insignificant amount of special items in the Paper segment in 2019.\n23\nNon-Operating Pension Expense,\nInterest Expense, Net and Income Taxes\nDuring 2020, non-operating pension expense decreased $10 million compared to 2019. The decrease in non-operating pension expense was primarily related to the favorable 2019 asset performance, partially offset by assumption changes.\nInterest expense, net, during 2020 decreased $35 million compared to 2019. The decrease is primarily related to higher interest expense during 2019 as a result of the Company’s November 2019 debt refinancing, partially offset by lower interest income due to lower rates on invested cash balances in 2020.\nDuring 2020, we recorded $172 million of income tax expense, compared with $221 million of income tax expense during 2019. The effective tax rate for 2020 and 2019 was 27.1% and 24.1%, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. We ended the year with $975 million of cash and cash equivalents, $148 million of marketable debt securities, and $326 million of unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility, net of letters of credit. Currently, our primary uses of cash are for operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service, common stock dividends, and repurchases of common stock. We believe that net cash generated from operating activities, cash on hand, available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available capital through access to capital markets will be adequate to meet our liquidity and capital requirements, including payments of any declared common stock dividends, for the foreseeable future. As our debt or credit facilities become due, we will need to repay, extend or replace such facilities. Our ability to do so will be subject to future economic conditions and financial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nBelow is a summary table of our cash flows, followed by a discussion of our sources and uses of cash through operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities (dollars in millions):\nOperating Activities\nOur operating cash flow is primarily driven by our earnings and changes in operating assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, as well as other factors described below. Cash requirements for operating activities are subject to PCA's operating needs and the timing of collection of receivables and payments of payables and expenses.\nDuring 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,033 million, compared to $1,207 million for 2019, a decrease of $174 million. Cash from operations excluding changes in cash used for operating assets and liabilities decreased $243 million, primarily due to lower income from operations as discussed above, as well as higher pension contributions made in 2020 compared to 2019 of $25 million.\nCash increased by $69 million due to favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily due to the following:\nThese favorable changes were partially offset by the following:\n24\nInvesting Activities\nWe used $426 million for investing activities in 2020, compared to $547 million in 2019. In 2020, we spent $421 million\nfor internal capital investments, compared to $400 million in 2019. During both 2020 and 2019, we did not acquire any businesses. In 2020, we used $3 million of cash-on-hand to purchase available-for-sale (AFS) marketable debt securities, net of redemptions, compared to $146 million in 2019.\nThe details of capital expenditures for property and equipment, excluding acquisitions, by segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are included in the table below (dollars in millions).\nWe expect capital investments in 2021 to be between $500 million and $525 million, excluding capital spending related to the potential conversion of the No. 3 paper machine to containerboard at our Jackson mill.\nThese expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors, including our financial results, strategic opportunities, future economic conditions, and our regulatory compliance requirements. We currently estimate capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations will be about $20 million in 2021. Our estimated environmental expenditures could vary significantly depending upon the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations. For additional information, see “Environmental Matters” in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had commitments for capital expenditures of\n$304.2 million. The Company believes that cash-on-hand combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these commitments.\nFinancing Activities\nIn 2020, net cash used for financing activities was $312 million, compared to $343 million of cash used for financing activities in 2019, a decrease of $31 million. We paid $300 million in dividends on our common stock in 2020, compared to $299 million paid in 2019. In 2019, we refinanced $900 million principal amount of our long term debt. Payments to redeem our old debt, including redemption premiums, exceeded the proceeds received from issuing the new debt by $27 million. We also paid $8 million of debt issuance costs. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the debt refinancing.\n25\nCommit\nments\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below sets forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations as of December 31, 2020 for the categories described below. Some of the amounts included in the table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties, and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, our actual payments may vary from those reflected in the table. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table below. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities (dollars in millions):\n26\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020.\nInflation and Other General Cost Increases\nWe are subject to both contractual, inflation, and other general cost increases. If we are unable to offset these cost increases by price increases, growth, and/or cost reductions in our operations, these inflation and other general cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating cash flows, profitability, and liquidity.\nIn 2020, our total company costs including cost of sales (COS) and selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) was $5.8 billion, and excluding non-cash costs (depreciation, depletion and amortization, pension and postretirement expense, and share-based compensation expense) was $5.4 billion. A 1% increase in COS and SG&A costs would increase costs by $58 million and cash costs by $54 million.\nCertain items of product input costs have historically been subject to more cost volatility including fiber, purchased energy, and chemicals.\nEnergy\nIn 2020, our mills, including both packaging and paper mills, consumed about 93 million MMBTUs of fuel, including internally generated and externally purchased, to produce both steam and electricity. The following table for 2020 provides the total MMBTUs purchased externally by fuel type each quarter and the average cost per MMBTU by fuel type for the year. Our mills represent about 90% of our total purchased fuel costs. The cost per MMBTU includes the cost of the fuel plus our transportation and delivery costs.\nIn addition, the mills purchased 22.64 million CkWh (hundred kilowatt-hours) of electricity in 2020. The purchases by quarter and the average cost per CkWh were as follows:\n27\nRegulatory and\nEnvironme\nnt\nal Matters\nOur operations are subject to our compliance with the laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, primarily in the United States. Of particular importance are laws and regulations relating to the environment and health and safety matters.\nEnvironmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business. We employ processes in the manufacture of containerboard, paper, and pulp, which result in various discharges, emissions and waste disposal. These processes are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. We operate and expect to continue to operate, under environmental permits and similar authorizations from various governmental authorities that regulate such discharges, emissions, and waste disposal. The most significant of these laws affecting the Company are:\nWe believe that we are currently in material compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations. Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, the Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws. The Company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable environmental regulations, and does not currently expect that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect its business or financial condition. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we spent $44 million, $41 million, and $40 million, respectively, to comply with the requirements of these and other environmental laws. Additionally, we had $9 million of environmental capital expenditures in both 2020 and 2019 and $7 million in 2018.\nIn January 2013, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) established a three-year deadline for compliance with the Boiler MACT regulations, establishing air emissions standards and certain other requirements for industrial boilers. PCA's compliance actions involved modifying or replacing certain boilers, and all PCA mills are in full compliance with Boiler MACT requirements.\nOn July 29, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a ruling on the consolidated cases challenging Boiler MACT. The court vacated key portions of the rule, including emission limits for certain subcategories of solid fuel boilers, and remanded issues to the EPA for further rulemaking. At this time, we cannot predict with certainty how this decision will impact our existing Boiler MACT compliance efforts or whether we will incur additional costs to comply with any revised standards.\nAs is the case with any industrial operation, PCA has, in the past, incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or groundwater contamination, as required by the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as the federal “Superfund” law, and analogous state laws. Cleanup requirements arise with respect to properties the Company currently owns or operates, former facilities and off-site facilities where the Company has disposed of hazardous substances. As part of the sale to PCA of the containerboard and corrugated products business of Pactiv Corporation in April 1999, Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing off-site waste disposal. Pactiv also retained environmentally impaired real property in Filer City, Michigan unrelated to current mill operations. In addition, OfficeMax (now an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Office Depot) retains responsibility for certain environmental liabilities related to some of the businesses, facilities, and assets we acquired from Boise. Generally, this responsibility relates to hazardous substance releases and other environmental incidents that arose before 2004. Some of these liabilities could be significant; however, Office Depot may not have sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnification obligations, and in some cases, we may not be entitled to such indemnification.\nBecause liability for remediation costs under environmental laws is strict, meaning that liability is imposed without fault, joint and several, meaning that liability is imposed on each party without regard to contribution, and retroactive, PCA could receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be material. From 2006 through 2020, there were no significant environmental remediation costs at PCA's mills and corrugated plants. As of December 31, 2020, we maintained an environmental reserve of $23.6 million relating to on-site landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects. The Company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenses above the $23.6 million accrued at December 31, 2020, will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n28\nWhile legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions has been proposed at the federal level, it is uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and, if so, what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be. The result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an increase in our future environmental compliance costs, through caps, taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify facilities, which may be material. However, climate change legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is encouraged. We currently self-generate\nthe majority o\nf our power requirements at our mills using bark, black liquor and biomass as fuel, which are derived from renewable resources. While we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of any renewable energy incentives, it is uncertain what the ultimate costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will be and how our business and industry will be affected.\nWe are also subject to extensive federal, state and local laws related to workplace health and safety, and our safety management system includes measures to assure compliance with these laws and regulations. We do not believe that future compliance with health and safety laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, PCA evaluates its estimates, including those related to business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets, pensions and other postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities, income taxes, and long-lived asset impairment, among others. PCA bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nCritical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results. These estimates require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. We review the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:\nPensions\nThe Company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 715,\nCompensation - Retirement Benefits\n. The calculation of pension expense and pension liabilities requires decisions about a number of key assumptions that can significantly affect expense and liability amounts, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, expected rate of compensation increases, longevity and service lives of participants, expected contributions, and other factors. The pension assumptions used to measure pension expense and liabilities are discussed in Note 12, Employee Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits.\nWe recognize the funded status of our pension plans on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and recognize the actuarial and experience gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits as a component of “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss” in our Consolidated Statement of Changes in Stockholders' Equity. Actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense in future periods. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $144.2 million of actuarial losses and prior service costs, net of tax, recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accumulated losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of assets will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active employees in PCA plans (which is between seven and nine years) and over the average remaining lifetime of inactive participants of Boise plans (which is between 23 and 26 years), to the extent that losses are not offset by gains in subsequent years. While we believe that the assumptions used to measure our pension obligations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and future expense.\n29\nWe believe that the accounting estimate related to pensions is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period. As discussed above, the future effects of pension plans on our financial position and results of operations will depend on economic conditions, employee demographics, mortality rates, retirement rates, investment performance, and funding decisions, among other factors.\nThe following table presents selected assumptions used and expected to be used in the measurement of pension expense in the following periods (dollars in millions):\nA change of 0.25% in either direction to the discount rate or the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on 2020 and 2021 pension expense (dollars in millions):\nFor more information related to our pension benefit plans, see Note 12, Employee Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nGoodwill Impairment\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. At December 31, 2020, we had $863.5 million of goodwill, all of which was recorded in the Packaging segment.\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may exceed fair value.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, with the exacerbated deterioration in uncoated freesheet market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the estimated impact on our Paper segment and its projected future results of operations, we identified a triggering event indicating possible impairment of goodwill within our Paper reporting unit and performed an interim quantitative impairment analysis as of May 31, 2020. For additional information, see Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nBased on the evaluation performed, we determined that the carrying value of the Paper reporting unit exceeded its fair value, which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge totaling $55.2 million, the full amount of goodwill associated with the Paper reporting unit. At December 31, 2020, we had $0 million of goodwill recorded in the Paper segment.\nUnder ASU 2017-04 (Topic 350),\nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other – Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\n, companies are no longer required to determine the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit to measure goodwill impairment, thus eliminating Step Two of the analysis that was required under the prior guidance. Under ASU 2017-04, goodwill impairment testing is performed by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount and\n30\nrecognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The Company adopted this ASU prospectively beginning with its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe update to the standard does not eliminate the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment that is often used to determine if the quantitative assessment is necessary. The qualitative assessment requires the evaluation of certain events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and overall financial performance, as well as company and reporting unit specific items. If, after assessing these qualitative factors, the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit is less than its fair value, then no further testing is required. Otherwise, the Company would perform a quantitative analysis.\nThe quantitative analysis requires companies to compare the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill was assigned to their respective carrying values. In calculating fair value, we use the income approach as our primary indicator of fair value. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows (Level 3 measurement). These estimates are based on a number of factors including industry experience, business expectations and the economic environment. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired, and the carrying value of goodwill is then reduced to the implied value, or to zero if the fair value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, through an impairment charge.\nDuring the annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2020, we assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Packaging reporting unit was less than its carrying value. Based on the results of the qualitative impairment test, we determined that it was more likely than not that the carrying value was less than the fair value of the Packaging reporting unit.\nIf management's estimates of future operating results materially change or if there are changes to other assumptions, the estimated fair value of our goodwill could change significantly. Such change could result in impairment charges in future periods, which could have a significant noncash impact on our operating results and financial condition. We cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might adversely affect the reported value of our goodwill. As additional information becomes known, we may change our estimates.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment\nAn impairment of a long-lived asset exists when the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through future undiscounted cash flows from operations and when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Long-lived asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate, as it is susceptible to change from period to period.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, with the exacerbated deterioration in uncoated freesheet market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the estimated impact on our Paper segment and its projected future results of operations, we identified a triggering event indicating possible impairment of our long lived assets within our Paper segment, including property, plant, and equipment, and performed a recoverability test on the Paper reporting unit long lived assets as of May 31, 2020. The recoverability test was based on forecasts of undiscounted cash flows. The results of the recoverability test indicated that the long lived assets within our Paper segment, inclusive of property, plant, and equipment, were 100% recoverable.\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. For purposes of testing for impairment, we group our long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets and liabilities. Our asset groupings vary based on the related business in which the long-lived asset is employed and the interrelationship between those long-lived assets in producing net cash flows. Asset groupings could change in the future if changes in the operations of the business or business environment affect the way particular long-lived assets are employed or the interrelationships between assets. To estimate whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is impaired, we estimate the undiscounted cash flows that could be generated under a range of possible outcomes. To measure future cash flows, we are required to make assumptions about future production volumes, future product pricing, and future expenses to be incurred. In addition, estimates of future cash flows may change based on the availability of fiber, environmental requirements, capital spending, and other strategic management decisions. We estimate the fair value of an asset or asset group based on quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly (Level 1 measurement) or indirectly (the amount for which the asset(s) could be bought or sold in a current transaction with a third party) when available (Level 2 measurement). When quoted market prices are not available, we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value (Level 3 measurement).\n31\nWe periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our assets. Changes in circumstances, such as changes to our operational or capital strategy, changes in regulation, or technological advances, may result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates. Revisions to the estimated useful lives of assets requires judgment and constitutes a change in accounting estimate, which is accounted for prospectively by adjusting or accelerating depreciation and amortization rates. In\n2020\nand\n2019\n, we recognized incremental depreciation expense\nof\n$\n4.5\nmillion\nand $0.3\nmillion, respectively\n. The incremental depreciation expense for 2020 related to closures of corrugated products facilities, while the incremental depreciation expense for\n2019\nprimarily related to the second quarter 2018 discontinuation of uncoated free sheet and coated one-side\nwhite paper\ngrades at the Wallula, Washington mill associated with the conversion of the No. 3 paper machine to\nproduce\nvirgin kraft linerboard.\nNew and Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\nFor a listing of our new and recently adopted accounting standards, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in “Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Reported Amounts\nNet income excluding special items, EBITDA, and EBITDA excluding special items are non-GAAP financial measures. Management excludes special items, as it believes that these items are not necessarily reflective of the ongoing operations of our business. These measures are presented because they provide a means to evaluate the performance of our segments and our Company on an ongoing basis using the same measures that are used by our management, because these measures assist in providing a meaningful comparison between periods and because these measures are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies and the performance of their segments. Any analysis of non-GAAP financial measures should be done in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures are not intended to be substitutes for GAAP financial measures and should not be used as such. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable measure reported in accordance with GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 follow (dollars in millions):\n32\nThe following table reconciles net income to EBITDA and EBITDA excluding special items for the periods indicated (dollars in millions):\n33\nThe following table reconciles segment income (loss) to EBITDA and EBITDA excluding special items (dollars in millions):"

    "text": "INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n35\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nPackaging Corporation of America:\nOpinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Packaging Corporation of America and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02,\nLeases (Topic 842)\n, and its subsequent amendments.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\n36\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEvaluation of the value of the pension benefit obligation\nAs discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s estimated pension benefit obligation totaled $1,566 million as of December 31, 2020. The pension benefit obligation is measured at the actuarial present value as of a date of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered before that date. The determination of the Company’s pension benefit obligation is dependent, in part, on the selection of certain actuarial assumptions, including the discount rate.\nWe identified the evaluation of the value of the pension benefit obligation as a critical audit matter because of the specialized skills required to evaluate the measurement of the pension benefit obligation. In addition, the measurement of the pension benefit obligation is sensitive to minor changes in the discount rate assumption.\nThe following are primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s pension benefit obligation valuation process, including a control related to the development of the discount rate. We involved an actuarial professional with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in understanding and assessing the actuarial methods and assumptions used to measure the pension benefit obligation. In addition, the actuarial professional assisted with our evaluation of the discount rate by assessing:\n•\nchanges in the discount rate from the prior year against changes in published indices\n;\n•\nthe pattern of cash flows,\nincluding consideration of the plan type and plan provisions; and\n•\nthe selected yield curve and its consistency with the prior year and spot rates.\nGoodwill impairment assessment\nAs discussed in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $863.5 million as of December 31, 2020, which related to the Packaging reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value. During the second quarter of the year-ended December 31, 2020, the Company identified a triggering event and recorded a goodwill impairment loss of $55.2 million related to its Paper reporting unit. To estimate the fair value of the Paper reporting unit, the\n37\nCompany utilized a combination of the income approach and a market approach that used observable comparable company information.\nWe identified the evaluation of goodwill for impairment for the Paper reporting unit as a critical audit matter. Especially subjective and challenging auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company’s estimated future cash flows, specifically the selection of forecasted revenue growth rates, gross profit margins, operating margins, and the discount rate used in the income approach.  Additionally, the audit effort associated with the evaluation of goodwill for impairment for the Paper reporting unit required the use of professionals with specialized skills and knowledge.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including controls over the selection of forecasted revenue growth rates, gross profit margins, operating margins, and the discount rate used in the estimate of the fair value of the Paper reporting unit. We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasted revenue growth rates, gross profit margins, and operating margins by comparing the forecasts to historical revenue growth rates, gross profit margins, and operating margins, and considering industry conditions and growth plans. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of reasonably possible changes to the forecasted revenue growth rates, gross profit margins, operating margins, and the discount rate assumptions on the reporting unit fair value. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n38\nPackaging Corporation of America\nConsolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income\n(dollars in millions, except per-share data)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n39\nPackaging Corporation of America\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(dollars and shares in millions, except per-share data)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n40\nPackaging Corporation of America\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n(dollars in millions)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n41\nPackaging Corporation of America\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity\n(dollars in millions and shares in thousands)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n42\nNotes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements\nPackaging Corporation of America (“we,” “us,” “our,” “PCA,” or the “Company”) was incorporated on\nJanuary 25, 1999\n. In April 1999, PCA acquired the containerboard and corrugated packaging products business of Pactiv Corporation (Pactiv), formerly known as Tenneco Packaging, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenneco Inc. We are a large, diverse manufacturer of both packaging and paper products. We are headquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois and we operate primarily in the United States. We have approximately\n15,200\nemployees.\nWe report our business in\nthree\nreportable segments: Packaging, Paper, and Corporate and Other. Our Packaging segment produces a wide variety of containerboard and corrugated packaging products. The Paper segment manufactures and sells a range of communication-based papers.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, due to an increase in demand for our corrugated products and as part of our assessment of a potential conversion to produce containerboard, we began producing high-performance, virgin kraft linerboard on the No. 3 machine at our Jackson, Alabama mill on a trial basis.\nBefore October 2020, operating results for the Jackson mill were included in the Paper segment. Beginning in October 2020, operating results for the Jackson mill are included in both the Packaging and Paper segments.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, the Company discontinued the production of uncoated free sheet and coated one-side white paper grades at the Wallula, Washington mill and converted the No. 3 machine at the mill from production of white papers to production of virgin kraft linerboard. Before May 2018, operating results for the Wallula mill were included in the Paper segment. After May 2018, operating results for the Wallula mill are primarily included in the Packaging segment.\nCorporate and other includes support staff services and related assets and liabilities, transportation assets, and activity related to other ancillary support operations. For more information about our segments, see Note 19, Segment Information.\nIn these consolidated financial statements, certain amounts in prior periods’ consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PCA and its majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. We adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in these estimates will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn accordance with ASU 2014-09 (Topic 606):\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n, we recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. The timing of revenue recognition for most goods and services occurs when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. This occurs with the transfer of control of our products at a specific point in time. For most packaging and paper products, revenue is recognized when the product is shipped from the mill or from our manufacturing facility to our customer. Shipping and handling fees billed to a customer are recorded on a gross basis in “Net sales”, with the corresponding shipping and handling costs included in “Cost of sales” in the concurrent period as the revenue is recorded. We present taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis in our Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 4, Revenue, for more information.\n43\nPlanned Major Maintenance Costs\nThe Company accounts for its planned major maintenance activities in accordance with ASC 360,\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\n, using the deferral method. All maintenance costs incurred during the year are expensed in the year in which the maintenance activity occurs.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation expense for awards granted under the PCA long-term equity incentive plans based on the fair value on the grant date. We recognize the cost of the equity awards expected to vest over the period the awards vest. See Note 14, Share-Based Compensation, for more information.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. The amount charged to expense was $\n15.5\nmillion, $\n16.0\nmillion, and $\n14.4\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $\n974.6\nmillion and $\n679.5\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which included cash equivalents of $\n662.2\nmillion\nand $\n410.7\nmillion, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $\n2.2\nmillion and $\n2.4\nmillion, respectively, of cash at our operations outside the United States.\nMarketable Debt Securities\nThe Company’s marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale (AFS) marketable debt securities in accordance with ASU 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses\n(Topic 326). The Company reports its marketable debt securities at fair value, and they are classified as short-term or long-term based on each security’s underlying contractual maturity date.\nThe Company’s marketable debt securities are analyzed at the individual debt security level. Changes in the fair value of the debt security have the potential to impact accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), the Company’s earnings, or both.\nThe Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any debt security is impaired. A decline in the fair value of the debt security below its amortized cost results in an impairment of the debt security. If there is an intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the debt security will be sold prior to recovering the amortized cost basis, the Company recognizes the impairment as a realized loss in earnings by writing down the debt security’s amortized cost basis.\nAdditional analysis is required if there is not an intent to sell the debt security, or if a recovery of the amortized cost basis is expected to be made prior to the sale of the security. If any portion of the impairment is the result of a credit loss, the Company recognizes this portion in earnings through an allowance for credit losses, with the remainder recognized as unrealized loss in AOCI. Subsequent improvements in credit losses are recognized as a reduction in the allowance. Any impairment not attributed to credit loss is recognized as an unrealized loss in AOCI in its entirety.\nThe Company considers several factors when determining if a portion of an impairment is the result of a credit loss including, but not limited to, adverse conditions related to the financial health and future outlook of the issuer; the credit quality of the issuer, as reported by credit rating agencies; trends present in the issuer’s industry in which it operates; and general market conditions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we do\nno\nt consider any of the impairments related to our marketable debt securities to be the result of credit losses. We recorded\nno\nother-than-temporary impairment charges on our AFS securities for the year ended December 31, 2019 under prior year guidance ASU 2016-01,\nFinancial Instruments – Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\n. See Note 11, Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Debt Securities, for more information.\n44\nTrade Accounts Receivable, Allowances, and Customer Deductions\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at amortized cost and represent a contractual right to receive payment from a customer. The Company’s trade accounts receivable are short-term receivables, with most requiring payment within 30 to 60 days, and represent the only class of financing receivables utilized by the Company. As of December 31, 2020, we do not expect the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our ability to collect on our outstanding trade accounts receivable.\nIn accordance with ASU 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses\n(Topic 326), the Company established an allowance for credit losses, which is a valuation account that estimates the expected credit loss over the lifetime of the asset and is deducted from, or added to, the amortized cost basis of the trade accounts receivable. The allowance for credit losses is based upon a combination of factors such as historical collection experience, aged receivables, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on future economic conditions. Expected recoveries of amounts previously written off, not to exceed the aggregate of the amount previously written off, are also considered when determining the necessary allowance at the balance sheet date. When determining the allowance for credit losses, management also considers specific customer accounts that may be considered higher risk or uncollectible due to customer industry trends, bankruptcy filings, or substantial downgrades of credit scores.\nCurrent period estimates for the allowance for credit losses are compared against the allowance previously recorded, and all required adjustments are reported as credit loss expense (for expected losses or write offs) or a reversal of credit loss expense (for expected recoveries) in net income. Outstanding trade accounts receivable balances are written off when deemed uncollectible after undergoing reasonable collection efforts. At December 31, 2020, the allowance for credit losses was $\n3.0\nmillion, and at December 31, 2019, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $4.2 million.\nThe customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount required for customer returns, allowances, and earned discounts. Based on the Company’s experience, customer returns, allowances, and earned discounts have averaged approximately\n1\n% of gross selling price. Accordingly, PCA reserves\n1\n% of its open customer accounts receivable balance for these items. The reserves for customer deductions of $\n7.6\nmillion\nand $\n8.4\nmillion\nat December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are also included as a reduction of the accounts receivable balance.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company records its derivatives, if any, in accordance with ASC 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n. The guidance requires the Company to recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use and designation of the derivative instrument. For a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the period of change at fair value together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earnings. We were not party to any derivative-based arrangements at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nFair Value Measurements\nPCA measures the fair value of its financial instruments and marketable debt securities in accordance with ASC 820,\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\n. The guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. It is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820 establishes the following hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nAssets that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.\n45\nFinancial instruments\nand\nmarketable\ndebt\nsecurities\nmeasured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis include the fair value\ns\nof our\nmarketable\ndebt\nsecurities\nand our\npension and postretirement benefit assets and liabilities.\nThe valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s marketable debt securities and pension and postretirement benefit assets and liabilities, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\nSee\nNote 11\n,\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and\nMarketable\nDebt\nSecurities\n, and\nNote 1\n2\n, Employee Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement\nBenefits\n,\nfor more information.\nOther assets and liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions and our asset retirement obligations. Given the nature of these assets and liabilities, evaluating their fair value from the perspective of a market participant is inherently complex. Assumptions and estimates about future values can be affected by a variety of internal and external factors. Changes in these factors may require us to revise our estimates and could require us to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we recorded for the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. These adjustments could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 13, Asset Retirement Obligations, for more information.\nInventory Valuation\nWe value our raw materials, work in process, and finished goods inventories using lower of cost, as determined by the average cost method, or market. Supplies and materials are valued at the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost methods.\nThe components of inventories were as follows (dollars in millions):\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost. Cost includes expenditures for major improvements and replacements and the amount of interest cost associated with significant capital additions. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred\n.\nWhen property and equipment are retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of, the asset's carrying amount and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in “Net income” in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nProperty, plant, and equipment consisted of the following (dollars in millions):\nThe amount of interest capitalized from construction in progress was $\n3.7\nmillion, $\n3.4\nmillion, and $\n4.5\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n46\nDepreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Assets under finance leases are depreciated on the straight-line method over the term of the lease or the useful life, if shorter. The following lives are used for the various categories of assets:\nThe amount of depreciation expense was $\n362.5\nmillion, $\n346.8\nmillion, and $\n361.7\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, we recognized incremental depreciation expense of $\n4.5\nmillion, $\n0.3\nmillion, and $\n14.5\nmillion, respectively. The incremental depreciation expense for 2020 related to closures of corrugated products facilities, while the incremental depreciation expense for 2019 and 2018 primarily related to the second quarter 2018 discontinuation of paper grades at the Wallula, Washington mill associated with the conversion of the No. 3 paper machine to produce virgin kraft linerboard.\nPursuant to the terms of an industrial revenue bond, title to certain property, plant, and equipment was transferred to a municipal development authority in 2009 in order to receive a property tax abatement. The title of these assets will revert back to PCA upon retirement or cancellation of the bond. The assets are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption “Property, plant, and equipment, net”, as all risks and rewards remain with the Company.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at the inception date based on the presence of identified assets and our right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from or to direct the use of such assets. When we determine a lease exists, we record a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets are recognized at commencement date at the value of the lease liability and are adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the discount rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nOperating lease balances are included in Operating lease right-of-use assets with the related liabilities included in Current Operating lease obligations and Long-term Operating lease obligations. Assets under finance leases are included in Property, plant and equipment, net, with the related liabilities included in Current Finance lease obligations and Long-term Finance lease obligations\n.\nWe do not record lease contracts with a term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe recognize fixed lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, we recognize amortization expense on the right-of-use asset and interest expense on the lease liability over the lease term.\nWe have lease agreements with non-lease components that relate to lease components (e.g., common area maintenance such as cleaning or landscaping, insurance, etc.). We account for each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single lease\ncomponent for all underlying asset classes. Accordingly, all costs associated with a lease contract are accounted for as lease costs.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment\nLong-lived assets other than goodwill and other intangibles are reviewed for impairment in accordance with provisions of ASC 360,\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated\n47\nfuture undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset (or group of assets) is compared to the assets (or group of assets) carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value is required.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, with the exacerbated deterioration in uncoated freesheet market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the estimated impact on our Paper segment and its projected future results of operations, we identified a triggering event indicating possible impairment of our long-lived assets within our Paper reporting unit, including property, plant, and equipment, and performed a recoverability test on the Paper reporting unit long-lived assets as of May 31, 2020. The recoverability test was based on forecasts of undiscounted cash flows. The results of the recoverability test indicated that the long-lived assets within our Paper segment, inclusive of property, plant, and equipment, were\n100\n% recoverable.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe Company has capitalized certain intangible assets, primarily goodwill, customer relationships, and trademarks and trade names, based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Amortization is provided for customer relationships on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from\nten\nto\n40\nyears\n, and trademarks and trade names over periods ranging from\nfive\nto\n20\nyears\n.\nGoodwill, which amounted to $\n863.5\nmillion and $\n918.7\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test in accordance with ASC 350,\nIntangibles – Goodwill and Other.\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may exceed fair value. Additionally, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our finite-lived purchased intangible assets to determine whether any adjustments to the useful lives are necessary.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, with the exacerbated deterioration in uncoated freesheet market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the estimated impact on our Paper segment and its projected future results of operations, we identified a triggering event indicating possible impairment of goodwill within our Paper reporting unit and performed an interim quantitative impairment analysis as of May 31, 2020. Based on the evaluation performed, we determined that the carrying value of the Paper reporting unit exceeded its fair value, which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge totaling $\n55.2\nmillion.\nThe Company concluded that\nnone\nof the goodwill or intangible assets were impaired in the 2020, 2019, and 2018 annual impairment tests. See Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for additional information.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits\nSeveral estimates and assumptions are required to record pension costs and liabilities, including discount rate, return on assets, and longevity and service lives of employees. We review and update these assumptions annually unless a plan curtailment or other event occurs, requiring that we update the estimates on an interim basis. While we believe the assumptions used to measure our pension and postretirement benefit obligations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and future expense. See Note 12, Employee Benefit Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits, for additional information.\nFor postretirement health care plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumption.\nEnvironmental Matters\nEnvironmental expenditures that extend the life of the related property or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized. Liabilities are recorded for environmental contingencies when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable. These liabilities are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Environmental expenditures related to existing conditions resulting from past or current operations from which no current or future benefit is discernible are expensed as incurred.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe Company accounts for its retirement obligations related predominantly to landfill closure, wastewater treatment pond dredging, closed-site monitoring costs, and certain leasehold improvements under ASC 410,\nAsset Retirement and Environmental Obligations\n, which requires recognition of legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets whether these assets are owned or leased. These legal obligations are recognized at fair value at the time that the obligations are\n48\nincurred. When we record the liability, we capitalize the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset, which is amortized to expense over the usefu\nl life of the asset. See\nNote 13\n, Asset Retirement Obligations, for additional information.\nDeferred Debt Issuance Costs\nPCA has capitalized certain costs related to obtaining its financing. These costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the terms of the related financing, which range from\n10\nto\n30\nyears\n. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, deferred debt issuance costs were $\n14.3\nmillion and $\n16.3\nmillion, respectively, and were recorded in “Long-Term Debt” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCutting Rights and Fiber Farms\nWe lease the cutting rights to approximately\n71,000\nacres of timberland. For our cutting rights, we capitalize the annual lease payments and reforestation costs associated with these leases. Costs are recorded as depletion when the timber or fiber is harvested and used in operations or sold to customers. Capitalized long-term lease costs for our cutting rights, primarily recorded in “Other long-term assets” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $\n20.3\nmillion and $\n21.6\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amount of depletion expense was $\n3.1\nmillion, $\n2.7\nmillion, and $\n7.6\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nDeferred Software Costs\nPCA capitalizes costs related to the purchase and development of software, which is used in its business operations. The costs attributable to these software systems are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on various factors such as the effects of obsolescence, technology, and other economic factors. Net capitalized software costs recorded in “Other long-term assets” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $\n4.8\nmillion and $\n1.4\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Software amortization expense was $\n1.1\nmillion, $\n0.9\nmillion, and $\n2.1\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nDuring 2019, the Company early adopted ASU 2018-15,\nIntangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal Use Software\n(Subtopic 350-40):\nCustomer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract\n,\nwhich includes amendments to align the accounting for costs incurred to implement a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. As of December 31, 2020, capitalized costs associated with cloud computing arrangements were $\n4.0\nmillion. These costs were immaterial as of December 31, 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nPCA utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby it recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets will be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon management’s estimates, it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period. The estimates utilized in the recognition of deferred tax assets are subject to revision in future periods based on new facts or circumstances. PCA’s practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nTrade Agreements\nPCA regularly trades containerboard with other manufacturers primarily to reduce shipping costs. These agreements are entered into with other producers on an annual basis, pursuant to which both parties agree to ship an identical number of tons of containerboard to each other within the agreement period. These agreements lower transportation costs by allowing each party’s containerboard mills to ship containerboard to the other party’s closer corrugated products plant. PCA tracks each shipment to ensure that the other party’s shipments to PCA match PCA’s shipments to the other party during the agreement period. Such transfers are possible because certain grades of containerboard are commodity products with no distinguishing product characteristics. These transactions are accounted for at carrying value, and revenue is not recorded as the transactions do not represent the culmination of an earnings process. The transactions are recorded into inventory accounts, and no sale or income is recorded until such inventory is converted to a finished product and sold to an end-use customer.\n49\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for acquisitions under ASC 805,\nBusiness Combinations\nand ASU 2017-01 (Topic 805):\nClarifying the Definition of a Business\n. ASC 805 requires separate recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from goodwill at the acquisition date fair values. ASU 2017-01 (Topic 805) provides additional guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transfers of assets and activities should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nEffective January 1, 2020,\nwe adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses\n(Topic 326)\n: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\nASU 2016-13 introduces the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) framework for evaluating credit losses on financial instruments measured at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 was applied using the modified retrospective method, and as a result, amounts recorded prior to January 1, 2020 have not been retrospectively restated. This new framework requires entities to incorporate forward-looking information into their estimate of current expected credit loss as of each reporting date. Although available-for-sale (“AFS”) debt securities are not within the scope of the new CECL framework, the ASU includes an amended impairment model for evaluating losses related to AFS debt securities. The guidance in this update also includes enhanced requirements for disclosures related to credit loss estimates\n.\nPrior to adoption of the new standard, the Company already incorporated forward-looking information into its estimate of credit losses for trade receivables. Due to the short duration of the Company’s trade receivables, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on trade receivables. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 also did not have a material impact on the Company’s AFS marketable debt securities, as the Company only invests in highly-rated AFS marketable debt securities. Overall, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flow\n.\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2018-13,\nFair Value Measurement\n(Topic 820):\nDisclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.\nASU 2018-13 removes or modifies certain disclosure requirements and adds additional requirements to improve the usefulness of the fair value measurement disclosure for financial statement users. Certain new requirements of ASU 2018-13 are required to be applied prospectively for the first interim period of the initial year of adoption. However, the modifications and removal of certain information needs to be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this Update did not have a significant impact on the Company’s related disclosures as reflected in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\n.\nEffective for the annual period ended December 31, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2018-14,\nCompensation – Retirement Benefits – Defined Benefit Plans – General\n(Subtopic 715-20):\nDisclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans.\nASU 2018-14 removes certain disclosures that are not considered cost beneficial, clarifies certain required disclosures, and adds additional disclosures. The amendments in this ASU were applied retrospectively in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and did not have a significant impact on the disclosures for our defined pension benefit plans and other postretirement benefits.\nEffective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)\n2016-02 (Topic 842):\nLeases\n, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The original guidance required application on a modified retrospective basis with the earliest period presented. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11,\nTargeted Improvements to ASC 842\n, which included an option to not restate comparative periods in transition and elect to use the effective date of ASC 842,\nLeases\n, as the date of initial application of transition, which we elected. As a result of the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, we recorded operating lease liabilities of $\n228\nmillion, with corresponding right-of-use assets of the same amount. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which allowed us to carry forward the historical lease classification and not to reassess whether existing or expired contracts contain a lease. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption, which permits us to exclude short-term leases (i.e. leases with terms of 12 months or less) from the recognition requirements of this standard, and we elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all classes of underlying assets except for embedded leases. The adoption of ASC 842 had an immaterial impact on our consolidated net earnings, liquidity and debt covenants under our current agreements for the year ended December 31, 2019. See Note 3, Leases, for more information.\n50\nNew Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04,\nReference Rate Reform\n(Topic 848):\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.\nASU 2020-04 provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for, or recognizing the effects of, reference rate reform on financial reporting. The amendments in this Update are elective and apply to all entities, subject to meeting certain criteria, that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Companies can apply the ASU immediately, but the guidance will only be available until December 31, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance, but does not expect the guidance to have a significant impact on its related disclosures.\nThere were no other accounting standards recently issued that had or are expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\n3.\nLeases\nWe group our leases into\ntwo\nprimary lease types, real estate and equipment, and into various asset classes within each type. Real estate leases primarily include manufacturing locations, office space, warehouses, and design centers, while equipment leases primarily include manufacturing equipment.\nLeases with an initial term of\n12\nmonths or less and certain month-to-month leases are not recorded on the balance sheet. The lease expense for these types of leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nTo determine the lease term, we include the non-cancellable period of the lease together with the following: all periods covered by an option to extend the lease if we are reasonably certain to exercise that option; any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if we are reasonably certain not to exercise that option; and any periods covered by an option to extend or not to terminate the lease that are controlled by the lessor. The exercising of lease renewal options is based on whether future economic benefit is expected to be derived from the renewal. Most of our real estate leases contain at least one renewal option. Renewal options generally range from\n1\nto\n5\nyears\n. Although equipment leases may also contain renewal options, we typically do not expect to extend and/or exercise these renewal options unless a compelling business reason is provided to management.\nOur leases may contain fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs determine the right-of-use asset. Variable costs are those costs which will vary month to month and are excluded from the calculation of the right-of-use asset. Variable lease costs are recorded to lease expense in the period in which they are incurred.\nOur leases do not provide an implicit borrowing rate of return. Therefore, we use our incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of lease payments at inception of the lease or when a lease is modified.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to our operating leases was as follows (dollars in millions):\n51\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to our finance leases was as follows (dollars in millions):\nThe Company was obligated under finance leases covering buildings and machinery and equipment in the amount of $\n16.0\nmillion\nand $\n17.5\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization of assets under finance lease obligations is included in depreciation expense.\nFor both operating and finance leases, the weighted average remaining lease term in years and weighted average discount rates were as follows:\nThe components of lease expense were as follows (dollars in millions):\nTotal lease expense, including base rent on all leases and executory costs, such as insurance, taxes, and maintenance, for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $\n115.1\nmillion. These costs are included in “Cost of sales” and “Selling, general, and administrative expenses” in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We had an insignificant amount of sublease rental income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and\nno\nsublease rental income for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nInterest expense related to finance lease obligations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $\n1.3\nmillion.\n52\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows (dollars in millions):\nThe future minimum payments under operating and finance lease liabilities at December 31, 2020 were as follows (dollars in millions):\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value added, and other taxes collected concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.\nThe following table presents our revenues disaggregated by product line (dollars in millions):\nPackaging Revenue\nOur containerboard mills produce linerboard and corrugating medium which are papers primarily used in the production of corrugated products. The majority of our containerboard production is used internally by our corrugated products manufacturing facilities. The remaining containerboard is sold to outside domestic and export customers. Our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products and retail merchandise displays. We sell corrugated products to national, regional and local accounts, which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations.\nThe Company recognizes revenue for its packaging products when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. This occurs with the transfer of control of our products at a specific point in time. Based on our\n53\nexpress terms and conditions of the sale of products to our customers, as well as terms included in contractual arrangements with our customers, we do not have an enforceable right of payment that includes a reasonable profit throughout the duration of the contract for products that do not have an alternative use. Revenue is recognized when the product is shipped from the mill or from our manufacturing facility to our customer. Certain customers may receive volume-based incentives, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenue recognized.\nCertain customers receive a portion of their packaging products as consigned inventory with billing triggered once the customer uses or consumes the designated product. Prior to invoicing, these amounts are handled as unbilled receivables. Total unbilled receivables, which are immaterial in amount, are included in the accounts receivable financial statement caption.\nPaper Revenue\nWe manufacture and sell a range of communication-based papers. Communication papers consist of cut-size office papers, and printing and converting papers.\nThe Company recognizes revenue for its paper products when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. This occurs with the transfer of control of our products at a specific point in time. Revenue is recognized when the product is shipped from the mill or from our manufacturing facility or distribution center to our customer. Certain customers may receive volume-based incentives, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenue recognized.\nCorporate and Other Revenue\nRevenue in this segment primarily relates to Louisiana Timber Procurement Company, L.L.C. (LTP), a variable-interest entity that is\n50\n% owned by PCA and\n50\n% owned by Boise Cascade Company (Boise Cascade). PCA is the primary beneficiary of LTP and has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of LTP. Therefore, we consolidate 100% of LTP in our financial statements. See Note 18, Transactions With Related Parties, for more information related to LTP.\nThe Company recognizes revenue within this segment when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. This occurs with the transfer of control of our products at a specific point in time.\nPractical Expedients and Exemption\nShipping and handling fees billed to a customer are recorded on a gross basis in \"Net sales\" with the corresponding shipping and handling costs included in \"Cost of sales\" in the concurrent period as the revenue is recorded. We expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. Sales commissions are recorded in \"Selling, general, and administrative expenses\".\nWe do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less\n.\n54\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted income per common share for the periods presented (dollars and shares in millions, except per share data).\nThe components of other expense, net, were as follows (dollars in millions):\n55\nThe following is an analysis of the components of the consolidated income tax provision (dollars in millions):\nThe effective tax rate varies from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate principally due to the following (dollars in millions):\nThe following details the scheduled expiration dates of our tax effected net operating loss (NOL) and other tax carryforwards at December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions):\n56\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December 31 are summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nCash payments for federal, state, and foreign income taxes were $\n115.6\nmillion, $\n172.7\nmillion, and $\n140.8\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the changes related to PCA’s gross unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties (dollars in millions):\nAt December 31, 2020, PCA had recorded a $\n5.2\nmillion gross reserve for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties. Of the total, $\n4.6\nmillion (net of the federal benefit for state taxes) would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.\nPCA recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties as income tax expense. For both years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $\n1.2\nmillion of interest and penalties recorded for unrecognized tax benefits.\n57\nDuring the next 12 months, it is possible that PCA's unrecognized tax benefits related to state apportionment issues could decrease by approximately $\n3.1\nmillion due to settlements with state taxing authorities.\nPCA is subject to income taxation in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, Canada and Hong Kong.\nA federal examination of the 2016 tax year commenced in April 2019.\nThe tax years 2016 - 2020 remain open to federal examination. The tax years 2016 - 2020 remain open to state examinations. Some foreign tax jurisdictions are open to examination for the\n2009\ntax year forward. Through the Boise acquisition, PCA recorded net operating losses and credit carryforwards from 2008 through 2011 and 2013 that are subject to examinations and adjustments for at least three years following the year in which utilized.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, with the exacerbated deterioration in uncoated freesheet market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the estimated impact on our Paper segment and its projected future results of operations, we identified a triggering event indicating possible impairment of goodwill and our long lived assets within our Paper reporting unit\n.\nGoodwill\nDue to the triggering event identified above an interim quantitative impairment analysis was performed as of May 31, 2020 for the Paper reporting unit, which is the same as our Paper reportable segment. We estimated the fair value of the Paper reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and the market approach, as further described below. Based on the evaluation performed, we determined that the carrying value of the Paper reporting unit exceeded its fair value, which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge totaling $\n55.2\nmillion. The impairment charge is included in “Goodwill impairment” on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income and is not tax deductible.\nFor purposes of our goodwill impairment analysis, we estimated the fair value of the Paper reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and the market approach applying an equal weighting. The income approach incorporated the estimated future cash flows and a terminal value discounted to their present value using an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate. The estimated future cash flows and terminal value were based on internal forecasts and industry trends, including the long-term outlook for the paper industry. Our expected cash flows include assumptions about industry pricing, expected paper demand, and anticipated input and conversion costs. The discount rate utilized in the income approach was\n9\n%, which was derived using a capital asset pricing model based on relevant industry data to estimate the cost of equity financing. The discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent in the business and the cash flow forecasts, updated for recent events. The market approach estimated the fair value of the Paper reporting unit by using valuation metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses.\nThe valuation of our Paper reporting unit requires significant judgment in evaluating recent indicators of market activity and estimated future cash flows, discount rates, and other factors. Our impairment analysis contains inherent uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact anticipated future economic and operating conditions. In making these estimates, the weighted-average cost of capital is utilized to calculate the present value of future cash flows and terminal value. Many variables go into estimating future cash flows, including estimates of our future revenue growth and operating results. When estimating our projected revenue growth and future operating results, we considered industry trends, economic data, and our competitive situation.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. At both December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $\n863.5\nmillion of goodwill recorded in our Packaging segment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $\n0\nmillion and $\n55.2\nmillion of goodwill recorded in our Paper segment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, respectively.\n58\nChanges in the carrying amount of our goodwill were as follows (dollars in millions):\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are comprised of customer relationships and trademarks and trade names. As a result of the triggering event described above, we also performed a recoverability test on our long-lived assets within the Paper segment, including long lived intangible assets, as of May 31, 2020. The recoverability test was based on forecasts of undiscounted cash flows. The results of the recoverability test indicated that the long lived assets within our Paper segment, inclusive of the long lived intangible assets, were\n100\n% recoverable.\nThe weighted average useful life, gross carrying amount, and accumulated amortization of our intangible assets were as follows (dollars in millions):\nAmortization expense was $\n42.9\nmillion (including the $\n4.5\nmillion adjustment to the customer relationships intangible asset related to the San Lorenzo, California facility closure, which was written off to amortization expense), $\n38.6\nmillion, and $\n40.5\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Estimated amortization expense of intangible assets over the next five years is expected to approximate $\n37.3\nmillion (2021),\n$\n34.9\nmillion (2022),\n$\n33.9\nmillion\n(2023),\n$\n33.4\nmillion (2024),\nand $\n33.2\nmillion (2025).\nImpairment Testing\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may exceed fair value. Additionally, when we experience changes to our business or operating environment, we evaluate the remaining useful lives and recoverability of our finite-lived purchased intangible assets to determine whether any adjustments to the useful lives or impairment are necessary. As discussed above, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed an interim quantitative impairment analysis of the goodwill and long-lived assets, including intangible assets, within our Paper reporting unit as of May 31, 2020 and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $\n55.2\nmillion. We also completed our annual test in the fourth quarter, and there was\nno\nfurther indication of goodwill or intangible asset impairment.\n59\nThe components of accrued liabilities were as follows (dollars in millions):\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, our long-term debt and interest rates on that debt were as follows (dollars in millions):\nOn November 21, 2019, the Company issued $\n500.0\nmillion of\n3.00\n% senior notes due 2029 and $\n400.0\nmillion of\n4.05\n% senior notes due 2049, through a registered public offering and notified the holders of its $\n500.0\nmillion of\n2.45\n% notes due\nDecember 15, 2020\nand $\n400.0\nmillion of\n3.90\n% notes due\nJune 15, 2022\nthat it would redeem those notes in\nDecember 2019\n. On December 6, 2019, PCA completed the redemption of the old\n2.45\n% notes for $\n509.7\nmillion, which included a redemption premium of $\n3.8\nmillion and $\n5.8\nmillion of accrued and unpaid interest. On December 23, 2019, PCA completed the redemption of the old\n3.90\n% notes for $\n418.7\nmillion, which included a redemption premium of $\n18.4\nmillion and $\n0.3\nmillion of accrued and unpaid interest. PCA used the proceeds of the offering of the new\n3.00\n% and\n4.05\n% notes and cash on hand to fund the redemptions and the $\n8.3\nmillion of debt issuance costs. The debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the terms of the notes.\n60\nAs of December 31,\n2020\n, the details of our borrowings were as follows:\nThe instruments governing our indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that limit the ability of PCA and its subsidiaries to enter into sale and leaseback transactions, incur liens, incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. Our credit facility also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including maintaining a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. A failure to comply with these restrictions could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness and/or prohibit us from drawing on the revolving credit facility. An acceleration under the revolving credit facility may also constitute an event of default under the senior notes indenture. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with these covenants.\nAt December 31, 2020, we have $\n2,493.7\nmillion of fixed-rate senior notes outstanding. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of our fixed-rate debt was estimated to be $\n2,827.1\nmillion. The difference between the book value and fair value is due to the difference between the period-end market interest rate and the stated rate of our fixed-rate debt. We estimated the fair value of our fixed-rate debt using quoted market prices (Level 2 inputs), discussed further in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nRepayments, Interest, and Other\nIn 2020, we did not repay any outstanding debt, as we did not have any maturities of our Senior Notes during 2020.\nIn December 2019, we used the net proceeds from the November 2019 offering of the new\n3.00\n% and\n4.05\n% notes and cash on hand to redeem the\n2.45\n% notes and\n3.90\n% notes. We completed the redemption of the old\n2.45\n% notes and\n3.90\n% notes for $\n509.7\nmillion and $\n418.7\nmillion, respectively, which included redemption premiums and accrued and unpaid interest.\nIn 2018, we used cash on hand to repay debt outstanding of $\n150.0\nmillion under the\n6.50\n% Senior Notes due\nMarch 15, 2018\nat maturity.\nAs of December 31, 2020, annual principal maturities for debt, excluding unamortized debt discount, are:\nnone\nfor 2021 through 2022, $\n700.0\nmillion for 2023;\n$\n400.0\nmillion for 2024;\nand $\n1.4\nbillion for 2025 and thereafter.\nInterest payments paid in connection with the Company’s debt obligations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $\n97.0\nmillion, $\n114.0\nmillion (including redemption premiums of $\n22.2\nmillion), and $\n97.0\nmillion, respectively.\n61\nIncluded in interest expense, net, are amortization of financing costs and, for 2019 and 2018, amortization of treasury lock settlements. Amortization of financing costs in 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $\n2.0\nmillion, $\n4.5\nmillion (including a $\n1.8\nmillion write-off of deferred debt issuance costs related to the November 2019 debt refinancing), and $\n2.7\nmillion, respectively. Amortization of treasury lock settlements was an $\n18.2\nmillion net loss in 2019 (including a $\n13.1\nmillion write-off of the remaining balance for treasury locks related to the November 2019 debt refinancing) and a $\n5.3\nmillion net loss in 2018.\n11.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Debt Securities\nThe following table shows the Company’s cash and available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities by major asset category at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, net realized gains and losses on the sales and maturities of certain marketable debt securities were insignificant.\nThe Company invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The maturities of the Company’s long-term marketable debt securities generally range from\none\nto\ntwo\nyears\n.\n62\nFair values were determined for each individual\nmarketable\ndebt\nsecurity in the investment portfolio.\nWhen evaluating a\nmarketable\ndebt\nsecurity for other-than-temporary impairment, PCA reviews factors such as the duration and extent to which the fair value of the\nmarketable\ndebt\nsecurity is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, the general market condition in which the issuer operates, and PCA's intent to sell or whether it will be more likely than not be required to sell, the\nmarketable\ndebt\nsecurity before recovery of its amortized cost basis.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we do not consider any of the impairments related to our marketable debt securities to be the result of credit losses. Therefore, we have not recorded an allowance for credit losses related to our marketable debt securities. All unrealized gains and losses were recorded in OCI. Additionally, we recorded no other-than-temporary impairment charges on our AFS securities for the year ended December 31, 2019 under prior year guidance ASU 2016-01,\nFinancial Instruments – Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\nThe following table provides information about the Company’s marketable debt securities that have been in a continuous loss position as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions, except number of marketable debt securities in a loss position):\nPCA has defined pension benefit plans for both salaried and hourly employees. The plans covering salaried employees are closed to new entrants with only certain current active participants still accruing benefits. The plans covering certain hourly employees are closed to new participants. We also have a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) and other nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that provide unfunded supplemental retirement benefits to certain of our current and former management employees. The SERP provides for incremental pension benefits in excess of those offered in our principal pension plans.\nOther Postretirement Benefits\nPCA provides postretirement medical benefits for certain retired salaried employees and postretirement medical and life insurance benefits for certain hourly employees. The plan covering salaried employees is closed to new participants.\n63\nObligations and Funded Status of Defined Benefit Pension and\nOther Postretirement Benefits Plans\nThe funded status of PCA's plans change from year to year based on the plan asset investment return, contributions, benefit payments, the discount rate used to measure the liability, and expected participant longevity.\nThe following table, which includes only company-sponsored defined benefit and other postretirement benefit plans, reconciles the beginning and ending balances of the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. We recognize the unfunded status of these plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and we recognize changes in funded status in the year changes occur through the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (dollars in millions):\n64\nComponents of Net Periodic Benefit Cost and Other Comprehensive (Income) Loss\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost and other comprehensive (income) loss (pretax) were as follows (dollars in millions):\nThe accumulated benefit obligations for the plans with obligations in excess of plan assets is $\n1.4\nbillion.\nAssumptions\nThe following table presents the assumptions used in the measurement of our benefits obligations:\nDiscount Rate Assumption.\nThe discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension obligations could be settled on the measurement date: December 31. The discount rate assumption used to calculate the present value of pension and postretirement benefit obligations reflects the rates available on high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments at December 31. In all periods, the bonds included in the models reflect anticipated investments that would be made to match the expected monthly\n65\nbenefit payments over time. The plans' projected cash flows were duration-matched to these models to develop an appropriate discount rate.\nAsset Return Assumption.\nThe expected return on plan assets reflects the expected long-term rates of return for the categories of investments currently held in the plans as well as anticipated returns for additional contributions made in the future. The expected long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental changes in expected returns on the plan investments. The weighted-average expected return on plan assets we will use in our calculation of 2021 net periodic pension benefit cost is\n4.91\n%.\nRate of Compensation Increase.\nThe rate of compensation increase is determined by PCA based upon annual reviews. The compensation increase assumption is not applicable for all plans as many of our pension plans are frozen and not accruing benefits.\nHealth Care Cost Trend Rate Assumptions.\nPCA assumed health care cost trend rates for its postretirement benefits plans were as follows:\nPostretirement Health Care Plan Assumptions.\nFor postretirement health care plan accounting, PCA reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumption.\nInvestment Policies and Strategies\nPCA has retained the services of professional advisors to oversee pension investments and provide recommendations regarding investment strategy. PCA’s overall strategy and related apportionments between equity and debt securities may change from time to time based on market conditions, external economic factors, and the funded status of the plans. The general investment objective for all of our plan assets is to optimize growth of the pension plan trust assets, while minimizing the risk of significant losses to enable the plans to satisfy their benefit payment obligations over time. The objectives take into account the long-term nature of the benefit obligations, the liquidity needs of the plans, and the expected risk/return trade-offs of the asset classes in which the plans may choose to invest.\nAssets of our pension plans were invested in the following classes of securities at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nAt December 31, 2020, the targeted investment allocations differed between the plans based on funded status. Our retirement committee reviews the investment allocations for reasonableness at a minimum, semi-annually.\nInvestment securities, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility risk, all of which are subject to change. Due to the level of risk associated with some investment securities, it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term, and such changes could materially affect the reported amounts.\n66\nFair Value Measurements of Plan Assets\nThe following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the pension plan assets, by major asset category, at fair value at December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in millions):\n67\nThe following table sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the pension plans' Level 3 assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions):\nFunding and Cash Flows\nPCA makes pension plan contributions that are sufficient to fund its actuarially determined costs, generally equal to the minimum amounts required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). From time to time, PCA may make discretionary contributions based on the funded status of the plans, tax deductibility, income from operations, and other factors. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, we made contributions of $\n82.5\nmillion, $\n57.9\nmillion, and $\n21.8\nmillion, respectively, to our qualified pension plans. We do not have a required minimum contribution amount established for 2021, but we expect to make discretionary contributions to our plans.\nThe following are estimated benefit payments to be paid to current plan participants by year (dollars in millions). Qualified pension benefit payments are paid from plan assets, while nonqualified pension benefit payments are paid by the Company.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nSome of our employees participate in contributory defined contribution savings plans, available to most of our salaried and hourly employees. The defined contribution plans permit participants to make contributions by salary reduction pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code. PCA made employer-matching contributions of $\n40.8\nmillion, $\n39.0\nmillion, and $\n36.8\nmillion in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. All company-matching contributions to all employees were made in cash. We expense employer matching contributions and charge dividends on shares held by the ESOP to retained earnings. Shares of company stock held by the ESOP are included in basic shares for earnings-per-share computations. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the ESOP held\n1.2\nmillion and\n1.5\nmillion shares of Company stock, respectively.\nCertain salaried and hourly employees that are not participating in a PCA sponsored defined benefit pension plan receive a service-related company retirement contribution to their defined contribution plan account in addition to any employer matching contribution. This contribution increases with years of service and ranges from\n3\n% to\n5\n% of base pay. We contributed $\n39.4\nmillion, $\n36.7\nmillion, and $\n33.3\nmillion for this retirement contribution during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nKey managers can elect to participate in a deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan is unfunded; therefore, benefits are paid from our general assets. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $\n22.6\nmillion and $\n17.4\nmillion, respectively, of liabilities attributable to participation in our deferred compensation plan on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n68\nOur asset retirement obligations relate predominantly to landfill closure, wastewater treatment pond dredging, closed-site monitoring costs, and certain leasehold improvements. In accordance with ASC 410,\nAsset Retirement and Environmental Obligations,\nwe recognize the fair value of these liabilities as an asset retirement obligation and capitalize that cost as part of the cost basis of the related asset in the period in which the costs are incurred if sufficient information is available to reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligation. Fair value estimates are determined using Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our asset retirement obligations is measured using expected future cash outflows discounted using the Company's credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Over time, the liability is accreted to its settlement value, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. These liabilities are based on the best estimate of costs and are updated periodically to reflect current technology, laws and regulations, inflation, and other economic factors. Occasionally, we become aware of events or circumstances that require us to revise our future estimated cash flows. When revisions become necessary, we recalculate our obligation and adjust our asset and liability accounts utilizing appropriate discount rates. No assets are legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations. Upon settlement of the liability, we will recognize a gain or loss for any difference between the settlement amount and the liability recorded.\nThe following table describes changes to the asset retirement obligation liability (dollars in millions):\nWe have additional asset retirement obligations with indeterminate settlement dates. The fair value of these asset retirement obligations cannot be estimated due to the lack of sufficient information to estimate the settlement dates of the obligations. These asset retirement obligations include, for example, (i) removal and disposal of potentially hazardous materials related to equipment and/or an operating facility if the equipment and/or facilities were to undergo major maintenance, renovation, or demolition and (ii) storage sites or owned facilities for which removal and/or disposal of chemicals and other related materials are required if the operating facility is closed. We will recognize a liability in the period in which sufficient information becomes available to reasonably estimate the fair value of these obligations.\nThe Company has a long-term equity incentive plan, which allows for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, and performance awards to directors, officers, and employees, as well as others who engage in services for PCA. On February 25, 2020, our board of directors approved and, on May 5, 2020, our stockholders approved, the amendment and restatement of the plan. The amendment extended the plan’s term to\nMay 5, 2030\nand increased the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the plan by\n1.4\nmillion shares. The total number of shares authorized for past and future awards is\n12.0\nmillion shares.\nAs of December 31, 2020, assuming performance units are measured at the target level of performance,\n1.5\nmillion shares remained available for future issuance under the current plan. Forfeitures are added back to the pool of shares of common stock available to be granted at a future date.\n69\nRestricted Stock\nRestricted stock awards granted to officers and employees generally vest at the end of a\nfour-year\nperiod, and restricted stock awards granted to directors vest immediately.\nA summary of the Company’s restricted stock activity follows:\nPerformance Units\nPerformance unit awards granted to certain key employees are earned based on the achievement of defined performance rankings of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) or Total Shareholder Return (TSR) compared to ROIC and TSR for peer companies. ROIC performance unit awards vest\nfour years\nafter the grant date, while TSR performance unit awards vest approximately\nthree years\nafter the grant date. Both ROIC and TSR performance units are paid out entirely in shares of the Company’s common stock.\nA summary of the Company’s performance unit activity follows:\nCompensation Expense\nOur share-based compensation expense is recorded in “Cost of sales” and “Selling, general, and administrative expenses”\nCompensation expense for share-based awards recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income, net of forfeitures was as follows (dollars in millions):\n70\nThe fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the closing price of the Company’s stock on the grant date.\nCompensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded over the requisite service period.\nAs PCA’s Board of Directors has the ability to accelerate\nthe\nvesting of\nthese\nawards upon an employee’s retirement, the Company accelerates the recognition of compensation expense for certain employees approaching normal retirement age.\nFor performance unit awards made in 2020. 2019, and 2018, in terms of grant date value,\n50\n% used TSR as the performance measure and\n50\n% used ROIC as the performance measure. All units awarded before 2018 used ROIC as the performance measure. The ROIC component of performance unit awards are valued based on the closing price of the stock on the grant date. As the ROIC component contains a performance condition, compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded over the requisite service period based on the most probable number of awards expected to vest. The TSR component of performance unit awards is valued using a Monte Carlo simulation as the TSR component contains a market condition. The Monte Carlo simulation estimates the fair value of the TSR component based on the expected term of the award, a risk-free interest rate, expected dividends, and expected volatility of the Company’s common stock and the common stock of the peer companies. Compensation expense is recorded ratably over the expected term of the award.\nThe unrecognized compensation expense for all share-based awards was as follows (dollars in millions):\nWe evaluate share-based compensation expense on a quarterly basis based on our estimate of expected forfeitures, review of recent forfeiture activity, and expected future turnover. We recognize the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all expense amortization in the period that we change the forfeiture estimate. The effect of forfeiture adjustments was insignificant in all periods presented.\nHedging Strategy\nWhen appropriate, we use derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary risks managed by using derivative financial instruments are interest rate risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company has used treasury lock derivative instruments to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates. In connection with contemplated issuances of ten-year debt securities, PCA entered into interest rate protection agreements with counterparties in 2008, 2010, and 2011 to protect against increases in the ten-year U.S. Treasury Note rate. These treasury rates served as references in determining the interest rates applicable to the debt securities the Company issued in March 2008 and June 2012. As a result of changes in the interest rates on those treasury securities between the time PCA entered into the derivative agreements and the time PCA priced and issued the debt securities, the Company: (1) made a payment of $\n4.4\nmillion to the counterparty upon settlement of the 2008 interest rate protection agreement on March 25, 2008; (2) received a payment of $\n9.9\nmillion from the counterparties upon settlement of the 2010 interest rate protection agreements on February 4, 2011; and (3) made a payment of $\n65.5\nmillion to the counterparty upon settlement of the 2011 interest rate protection agreement on June 26, 2012. The Company recorded the effective portion of the settlements in accumulated OCI, and these amounts were amortized over the terms of the respective notes.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recorded a charge of $\n13.1\nmillion in interest expense from the write-off of the remaining treasury lock balance due to the redemption of the\n3.90\n% notes on December 23, 2019. The Company has not entered into any new interest rate protection agreements subsequent to the fourth quarter 2019 write-off of the remaining treasury lock balance.\n71\nDerivative Instruments\nThe impact of derivative instruments on the consolidated statements of income and accumulated OCI was as follows (dollars in millions):\nAs a result of our November 2019 debt refinancing and redemption of the\n3.90\n% notes due June 15, 2022, the Company accelerated the amortization of the remaining treasury lock balance of $\n13.1\nmillion ($\n6.5\nmillion after tax) during the fourth quarter of 2019. The after tax amount includes $\n3.2\nmillion of income tax benefit from the stranded tax effects in accumulated OCI related to the write-off of the remaining treasury lock balance.\nDividends\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we paid $\n299.6\nmillion of dividends to shareholders. On December 10, 2020, PCA announced an increase of its quarterly cash dividend on its common stock from an annual rate of $\n3.16\nper share to $\n4.00\nper share. Also, on December 10, 2020, PCA's Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $\n1.00\nper share of common stock, which was paid on January 15, 2021 to shareholders of record as of December 21, 2020.\nThe dividend payment was $\n94.8\nmillion.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn February 25, 2016, PCA announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $\n200.0\nmillion of the Company's outstanding common stock. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities regulations. The timing and amount of repurchases will be determined by the Company in its discretion based on factors such as PCA’s stock price and market and business conditions.\nThe Company did\nno\nt repurchase any shares of its common stock under this authority during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. All shares repurchased in prior years have been retired. At December 31, 2020, $\n193.0\nmillion\nof the authorized amount remained available for repurchase of the Company's common stock.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nChanges in AOCI, net of taxes, by component follows (dollars in millions). Amounts in parentheses indicate losses.\n72\nThe following table presents information about reclassifications out of AOCI (dollars in millions). Amounts in parentheses indicate expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nOur Paper segment has had a long-standing commercial and contractual relationship with Office Depot, our largest customer in the paper business. This relationship exposes us to a significant concentration of business and financial risk. Our sales to Office Depot represented approximately\n5\n% and\n7\n% of our total Company sales for 2020 and 2019, respectively, and about\n45\n% and\n50\n% of our Paper segment sales revenue for those periods, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $\n39.6\nmillion and $\n76.2\nmillion of accounts receivable due from Office Depot, respectively, which represents approximately\n5\n% and\n9\n% of our total Company receivables, respectively.\nIn 2020, sales to Office Depot represented about\n45\n% of our Paper segment sales. If these sales are reduced, we would need to find new customers. We may not be able to fully replace any lost sales, and any new sales may be at lower prices or higher costs. Any significant deterioration in the financial condition of Office Depot affecting its ability to pay or any other change that affects its willingness to purchase our products will harm our business and results of operations.\nLabor\nAt December 31, 2020, we had approximately\n15,200\nemployees and approximately\n44\n%\nof these employees worked pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. Approximately\n62\n% of our hourly employees are represented by unions. The majority of our unionized employees are represented by the United Steel Workers (USW), the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), the International Association of Machinists (IAM), and the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers (AWPPW).\nApproximately\n11\n%\nof our employees work pursuant to collective bargaining agreements that will expire within the next twelve months.\nLouisiana Timber Procurement Company, L.L.C. (LTP) is a variable-interest entity that is\n50\n% owned by PCA and\n50\n% owned by Boise Cascade Company (Boise Cascade). LTP procures sawtimber, pulpwood, residual chips, and other residual wood fiber to meet the wood and fiber requirements of PCA and Boise Cascade in Louisiana. PCA is the primary beneficiary of LTP and has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of LTP. Therefore, we consolidate 100% of LTP in our financial statements in our Corporate and Other segment. The carrying amounts of LTP's assets and liabilities (which relate primarily to non-inventory working capital items) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets were $\n2.5\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and $\n3.9\nmillion at December 31, 2019. For 2020, 2019, and 2018, we recorded $\n70.6\nmillion, $\n81.7\nmillion, and $\n83.1\nmillion, respectively, of LTP sales to Boise Cascade in “Net Sales” in the Consolidated Statements of Income and approximately the same amount of expenses in “Cost of Sales”.\n73\nFiber purchases from related parties were $\n12.6\nmillion\nfor 2020 and $\n16.8\nmillion\nfor both 2019 and 2018. Most of these purchases related to chip and log purchases by LTP from Boise Cascade's wood products business. These purchases are recorded in “Cost of Sales” in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe report our business in\nthree\nreportable segments: Packaging, Paper, and Corporate and Other. These segments represent distinct businesses that are managed separately because of differing products and services. Each of these businesses requires distinct operating and marketing strategies.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, due to an increase in demand for our corrugated products and as part of our assessment of a potential conversion to produce containerboard, we began producing high-performance, virgin kraft linerboard on the No. 3 machine at our Jackson, Alabama mill on a trial basis. Before October 2020, operating results for the Jackson mill were included in the Paper segment. Beginning in October 2020, operating results for the Jackson mill are included in both the Packaging and Paper segments.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, the Company discontinued the production of paper grades at the Wallula, Washington mill and converted the No. 3 machine at the mill to produce virgin kraft linerboard. Before May 2018, operating results for the Wallula mill were included in the Paper segment. After May 2018, operating results for the Wallula mill are primarily included in the Packaging segment.\nPackaging.\nWe manufacture and sell a wide variety of containerboard and corrugated packaging products, including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods, multi-color boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations. In addition, we are a large producer of packaging for meat, fresh fruit and vegetables, processed food, beverages, and other industrial and consumer products.\nPaper.\nWe manufacture and sell a range of communication-based papers. Our papers can be manufactured as either commodity papers or specialty papers with specialized or custom features, such as colors, coatings, high brightness, or recycled content.\nCorporate and Other.\nOur Corporate and Other segment includes corporate support staff services and related assets and liabilities, and foreign exchange gains and losses. This segment also includes transportation assets, such as rail cars and trucks, which we use to transport our products from some of our manufacturing sites and assets related to LTP. See Note 18, Transactions with Related Parties, for more information related to LTP. Sales in this segment relate primarily to LTP and our rail and truck business. We provide transportation services not only to our own facilities but also, on a limited basis, to third parties when geographic proximity and logistics are favorable. Rail cars and trucks are generally leased.\nEach segments' profits and losses are measured on operating profits before interest expense, net and other and income taxes. For many of these allocated expenses, the related assets and liabilities remain in the Corporate and Other segment.\nSegment sales to external customers by product line were as follows (dollars in millions):\nSales to foreign unaffiliated customers during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were\n$\n318.7\nmillion, $\n394.9\nmillion, and $\n487.8\nmillion, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did\nno\nt have any significant long-lived assets held by foreign operations.\n74\nAn analysis of operations by reportable segment is as follows (dollars in millions):\n(a)     Includes the following:\n75\n(b)     Includes the following:\n(c)     During the second quarter of 2020, with the exacerbated deterioration in uncoated freesheet market conditions and the estimated impact on our Paper reporting unit arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as projected future results of operations, we identified a triggering event indicating possible impairment of goodwill within our Paper reporting unit. The Company performed an interim quantitative impairment analysis as of May 31, 2020, and, based on the evaluation performed, we determined that goodwill was fully impaired for the Paper reporting unit and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $\n55.2\nmillion.\n(d)     Includes the following:\n(e)\nIncludes $\n0.2\nmillion of charges related to the second quarter discontinuation of uncoated free sheet and coated one-side           white paper grades at the Wallula, Washington mill associated with the conversion of the No. 3 paper machine to produce virgin kraft linerboard.\n(f)\nIncludes $\n38.7\nmillion of charges related to the Company’s November 2019 debt refinancing, which included redemption premiums and the write-offs of remaining balances of treasury locks and unamortized debt issuance costs.\n(g)     Includes the following:\n(h)\nIncludes $\n17.7\nmillion of charges related to the\nsecond quarter discontinuation of uncoated free sheet and coated one-side white paper grades at the Wallula, Washington mill associated with the conversion of the No. 3 paper machine to produce virgin kraft linerboard.\n(i)\nIncludes $\n0.2\nmillion of charges consisting of closure costs related to a corporate administration facility.\n(j)\nIncludes “Additions to property, plant, and equipment” and excludes cash used for “Acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired” as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nWe have financial commitments and obligations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. These include long-term debt (discussed in Note 10, Debt), lease obligations (discussed in Note 3, Leases), capital commitments, purchase commitments for goods and services, and legal proceedings (discussed below).\nCapital Commitments\nThe Company had capital commitments of approximately $\n304.2\nmillion and $\n212.6\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in connection with the expansion and replacement of existing facilities and equipment.\nPurchase Commitments\nIn the table below, we set forth our enforceable and legally binding purchase obligations as of December 31, 2020. Some of the amounts are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties, and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, our actual payments may vary from those reflected in the table. Purchase orders made in the ordinary\n76\ncourse of business are excluded below. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as accounts payable and accrued liabilities. These obligations relate to various purchase agreements for items such as minimum amounts of energy and fiber purchases over periods ranging from\none year\nto\n31\nyears\n.\nTotal purchase commitments were as follows (dollars in millions):\nThe Company purchased a total of $\n317.6\nmillion, $\n315.0\nmillion, and $\n341.9\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, under these purchase agreements.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOn August 8, 2019, the EPA issued a notice of violation (NOV) alleging violations of the Clean Air Act, resulting from an inspection at our Wallula, Washington mill in September 2018. PCA denies the violations set forth in the NOV and has requested that the EPA’s Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards provide an applicability determination to clarify that the relevant operations of PCA have not violated the regulations at issue in the NOV. The EPA denied our request in 2020. We intend to vigorously defend any enforcement action and, on July 27, 2020, filed a petition with the EPA to reconsider its denial of our applicability determination and filed petitions in U.S. federal court to review the agency’s denial of our applicability determination as well as the rule at issue. While we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of this matter, we believe that we have a meritorious position that our operations have not violated the Clean Air Act, that we have taken appropriate action to address the matters raised by the EPA in the NOV, and that this matter will not result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe potential costs for various environmental matters are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup costs, the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations, and the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies. From 2006 through 2020, there were no significant environmental remediation costs at PCA's mills and corrugated plants. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $\n23.6\nmillion of environmental-related reserves recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. Of the $\n23.6\nmillion, approximately $\n15.5\nmillion related to environmental-related asset retirement obligations discussed in Note 13, Asset Retirement Obligations, and $\n8.1\nmillion related to our estimate of other environmental contingencies. The Company recorded $\n4.6\nmillion in “Accrued liabilities” and $\n19.0\nmillion in “Other long-term liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Liabilities recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available information and assumptions. Because of these uncertainties, PCA’s estimates may change. The Company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures for remediation costs and asset retirement obligations above the $\n23.6\nmillion\naccrued as of December 31, 2020 will have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nGuarantees and Indemnifications\nWe provide guarantees, indemnifications, and other assurances to third parties in the normal course of our business. These include tort indemnifications, environmental assurances, and representations and warranties in commercial agreements. At December 31, 2020, we are not aware of any material liabilities arising from any guarantee, indemnification, or financial assurance we have provided. If we determined such a liability was probable and subject to reasonable determination, we would accrue for it at that time.\nDeRidder Mill Incident\nOn\nFebruary 8, 2017\n, a tank located in the pulp mill at the Company's DeRidder, Louisiana facility exploded, resulting in three contractor fatalities and other injuries. The Company has been served with multiple lawsuits involving the decedents and other allegedly injured parties, alleging negligence on the part of the Company and claiming compensatory and punitive damages. The Company is vigorously defending these lawsuits. The Company believes that these suits are covered by its liability insurance policies, subject to an aggregate $\n1.0\nmillion deductible, which has been satisfied in full as a result of settlement of various lawsuits and fees and expenses incurred by the Company. All pending lawsuits are in the early stages. Accordingly, the Company is unable to estimate a range of reasonable possible losses at this time.\n77\nThe Company has cooperated with investigations from the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The U.S. Chemical Safety Board completed its investigation and issued its report during the second quarter of 2018. The Company settled with OSHA during the second quarter of 2018 and paid approximately $\n40,000\nin penalties for citations.\nThe EPA investigation is ongoing. In May 2017, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted an on-site inspection of the facility to assess compliance with the Clean Air Act, Risk Management Program (RMP). The Company provided additional information to the EPA promptly after the inspection to address certain areas of concern (AOCs) observed during the inspection. In January 2021, the EPA and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) initiated civil judicial enforcement discussions with PCA. These discussions are ongoing. As of the date of filing of this report, no complaint has been filed. PCA continues to cooperate with the agencies. Since the inspection in 2017, PCA performed several voluntary activities to address the AOCs presented in the EPA’s inspection report and has removed the RMP covered process from the facility.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are also a party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. These legal actions include commercial liability claims, premises liability claims, and employment-related claims, among others. As of the date of this filing, we believe it is not reasonably possible that any of the legal actions against us will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nNote: The sum of the quarters may not equal the total of the respective year's earnings per share on either a basic or diluted basis due to changes in the weighted average shares outstanding throughout the year.\n78\n79"

    "text": "Controls and Procedures\nPCA maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in PCA’s filings under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to PCA’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nPrior to filing this report, PCA completed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of PCA’s management, including PCA’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of PCA’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020. The evaluation of PCA’s disclosure controls and procedures included a review of the controls’ objectives and design, PCA’s implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the information generated for use in this report. Based on this evaluation, PCA’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that PCA’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2020.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2020, there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, PCA’s internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nPCA’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, PCA’s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nPCA’s management, under the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, PCA’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020, based on the specified criteria.\nKPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited PCA’s financial statements included in this Form 10-K, has also audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Their attestation report precedes PCA’s audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report."
