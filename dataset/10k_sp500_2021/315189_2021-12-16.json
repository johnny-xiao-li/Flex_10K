All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and business. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expected. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, or cautionary statements, and other important information about forward-looking statements are disclosed under Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Safe Harbor Statement” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nProducts\nIn fiscal year 2021, Deere & Company (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, John Deere) implemented a new operating model and reporting structure. With this change, John Deere’s agriculture and turf operations were divided into two new segments: production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf. There were no reporting changes for the construction and forestry and financial services segments. As a result, John Deere’s operations are now categorized into four major business segments:\nThe\nproduction and precision agriculture\nsegment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for production-scale growers of large grains, small grains, cotton, and sugar. The segment’s main products include large and certain mid-size tractors, combines, cotton pickers, sugarcane harvesters and loaders, and soil preparation, seeding, application, and crop care equipment.\nThe\nsmall agriculture and turf\nsegment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for dairy and livestock producers, high-value crop producers, and turf and utility customers. The segment’s primary products include certain mid-size and small tractors, as well as hay and forage equipment, riding and commercial lawn equipment, golf course equipment, and utility vehicles.\nThe\nconstruction and forestry\nsegment defines, develops, and delivers a broad range of machines and technology solutions organized along the earthmoving, forestry, and roadbuilding production systems. The segment’s primary products include crawler dozers and loaders, four-wheel-drive loaders, excavators, skid-steer loaders, milling machines, and log harvesters.\nThe products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets, and, as it relates to roadbuilding products in certain markets outside the U.S. and Canada, primarily through Company-owned sales and service subsidiaries.\nThe\nfinancial services\nsegment primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, finances retail revolving charge accounts, and offers extended equipment warranties.\nJohn Deere’s worldwide production and precision agriculture operations, small agriculture and turf operations, and construction and forestry operations are sometimes collectively referred to as the “equipment operations.” The financial services segment is sometimes referred to as the “financial services operations.” The production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf segments are sometimes collectively referred to as “agriculture and turf” or the “agriculture and turf operations.”\nAdditional information is presented in the discussion of business segment and geographic area results on pages 28 – 30. The John Deere enterprise has manufactured agricultural equipment since 1837. The present Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 1958.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s internet address is\nhttp://www.deere.com\n. Through that address, the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports are available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (Securities and Exchange Commission or Commission). The information contained on the Company’s website is not included in, nor incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMarket Conditions\nAgriculture and Turf.\nIndustry sales of large agricultural machinery in the U.S. and Canada are forecasted to increase approximately 15 percent compared to 2021. Industry sales of small agricultural and turf equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be flat in\n2\n2022. Industry sales of agricultural machinery in Europe are forecasted to be about 5 percent higher, while South American industry sales of tractors and combines are forecasted to be roughly 5 percent higher in 2022. Asia industry sales are forecasted to be nearly the same in 2022 as in 2021.\nConstruction and Forestry.\nOn an industry basis, North American construction equipment and compact construction equipment sales are both expected to be 5 to 10 percent higher in 2022. Global forestry industry sales are expected to increase 10 to 15 percent.\nFinancial Services.\nThe Company’s financial services operations for full-year fiscal 2022 are expected to experience slightly lower results due to a higher provision for credit losses, lower gains on operating lease residual values, and higher selling, administrative, and general expenses. These factors are expected to be partially offset by income earned on a higher average portfolio.\n2021 Consolidated Results Compared with 2020\nFor fiscal 2021, worldwide net income attributable to the Company was $5.963 billion, or $18.99 per share, compared with $2.751 billion, or $8.69 per share, in fiscal 2020. Worldwide net sales and revenues increased 24 percent to $44.024 billion in 2021, compared with $35.540 billion in 2020. Net income in 2020 was negatively affected by impairment charges and employee-separation costs of $458 million after-tax (see Notes 4 and 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, net income in 2020 was unfavorably affected by discrete adjustments to the provision for income taxes. Net sales of the worldwide equipment operations increased in fiscal 2021 to $39.737 billion, compared with $31.272 billion last year. Production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry sales increased during 2021 due to higher shipment volumes and price realization.\nWorldwide equipment operations had an operating profit of $6.868 billion in fiscal 2021, compared with $3.559 billion in fiscal 2020. Operating profit for production and precision agriculture increased due to price realization, higher shipment volumes / sales mix, and a favorable indirect tax ruling in Brazil. These items were partially offset by higher production costs. The prior year was also impacted by voluntary employee-separation program expenses. Operating profit for small agriculture and turf increased largely as a result of higher shipment volumes/sales mix and price realization. Partially offsetting these factors were higher production costs. Results for the current year were positively impacted by a gain on the sale of a factory in China, while results for the prior year were affected by impairments, closure costs, and voluntary employee-separation program expenses. Construction and forestry’s operating profit increased mainly due to higher shipment volumes/sales mix and price realization, partially offset by higher production costs. The prior year was also impacted by employee-separation program expenses and impairments in certain fixed assets and unconsolidated affiliates.\nNet income of the Company’s equipment operations was $5.082 billion for fiscal 2021, compared with $2.185 billion in fiscal 2020. The equipment operations’ provision for income taxes and net income in 2020 were adversely affected by non-deductible impairments and charges.\nThe financial services operations reported net income attributable to the Company of $881 million for fiscal 2021 compared with $566 million in fiscal 2020. The increase was mainly due to improvement on operating lease residual values, a lower provision for credit losses, more favorable financing spreads, and income earned on a higher average portfolio.\nThe cost of sales to net sales ratio for 2021 was 73.3 percent, compared with 75.7 percent for 2020. The cost of sales to net sales ratio decreased compared to 2020 mainly due to price realization and the impact of impairments and employee-separation expenses recorded in 2020 (see Note 5).\nAdditional information on fiscal 2021 results is presented on pages 27 – 30.\nEQUIPMENT OPERATIONS\nProduction and Precision Agriculture\nThe production and precision agriculture segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for production-scale growers of large grains (such as corn and soy), small grains (such as wheat, oats, and barley), cotton, and sugar. Equipment manufactured and distributed by the segment includes large and certain mid-size tractors, combines, cotton pickers, cotton strippers, sugarcane harvesters, related harvesting front-end equipment, sugarcane loaders, pull-behind scrapers, and tillage, seeding, and application equipment, including sprayers and nutrient management and soil preparation machinery.\nThe segment also provides integrated agricultural solutions and precision technologies across its portfolio of large equipment. John Deere has developed a unique, production system-level approach designed to improve customer profitability, productivity, and sustainability. This approach includes precise global navigation satellite systems technology, advanced connectivity and telematics, on-board sensors and computing power, automation software, digital tools, and applications and analytics that together enable seamless integration of information designed to improve customer decision making and job execution. John Deere’s advanced telematics systems remotely connect equipment owners, business managers, and dealers to equipment in the field, providing real-time\n3\nalerts and information about equipment location, utilization, performance, and maintenance to improve productivity and efficiency, as well as to monitor agronomic job execution.\nIn addition to the John Deere brand, the production and precision agriculture segment manufactures and sells sprayers under the Hagie and Mazzotti brand names, planters and cultivators under the Monosem brand name, sprayers and planters under the PLA brand name, and carbon fiber sprayer booms under the King Agro brand name. The segment also sells sugarcane harvester aftermarket parts under the Unimil brand name. Aftermarket parts for production and precision agriculture products are also sold under the Vapormatic and A&I brand names. John Deere manufactures its production and precision agriculture equipment for sale primarily through independent retail dealer networks.\nSmall Agriculture and Turf\nThe small agriculture and turf segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for dairy and livestock producers, high-value crop producers, and turf and utility customers. The segment works to leverage integrated agricultural solutions and precision technologies across its portfolio of equipment. Equipment manufactured and distributed by the segment includes: certain mid-size as well as small and utility tractors and related loaders and attachments; turf and utility equipment, including riding lawn equipment, commercial mowing equipment, golf course equipment, utility vehicles, implements for mowing, tilling, snow and debris handling, aerating, and many other residential, commercial, golf, and sports turf care applications, and other outdoor power products; and hay and forage equipment, including self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers, and mowers. John Deere also purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale.\nIn addition to the John Deere brand, the small agriculture and turf segment purchases and sells a variety of equipment attachments under the Frontier, Kemper, and Green Systems brand names. Aftermarket parts for small agriculture and turf products are sold under the Vapormatic, A&I, and Sunbelt brand names. John Deere’s small agriculture and turf equipment is sold primarily through independent retail dealer networks, although the segment also builds turf products for sale by mass retailers, including The Home Depot and Lowe’s.\nAgriculture and Turf Operations\nOperating Model\n. John Deere’s production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf segments together offer a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service parts. The segments are aligned around production systems, enabling focus on delivering equipment, technology, and solutions across all the jobs customers execute during a season. This holistic approach to production systems enables John Deere to invest in the product roadmap and related research and development. Sales and marketing support for both the production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf segments continues to be organized around four geographic customer focus areas.\nBusiness Environment\n. Sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts, which reflect levels of farm commodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields, and government policies, including global trade policies, the amount and timing of government payments, and policies related to climate change. Sales are also influenced by general economic conditions, farmland prices, farmers’ debt levels and access to financing, interest and exchange rates, agricultural trends, including the production of and demand for renewable fuels, labor availability and costs, energy costs, tax policies, and other input costs associated with farming. Other important factors affecting new agricultural equipment sales are the value and level of used equipment, including tractors, harvesting equipment, self-propelled sprayers, hay and forage equipment, and seeding equipment. Weather and climatic conditions can also affect buying decisions of agricultural equipment purchasers.\nInnovations in machinery and technology also influence agricultural equipment purchasing. For example, larger, more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations. Large, cost-efficient, highly-mechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output. These customers are increasingly adopting and integrating precision agricultural technologies like guidance, telematics, and data management in their operations. The large-size agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to John Deere. A large proportion of the equipment operations’ total agricultural equipment sales in the U.S. and Canada, and a large proportion of sales in many countries outside the U.S. and Canada, are comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower, self-propelled combines, self-propelled cotton pickers, self-propelled forage harvesters, self-propelled sprayers, and seeding equipment. However, small tractors are an important part of our global tractor business. Further, John Deere offers a number of harvesting solutions to support development of the mechanized harvesting of grain, oilseeds, cotton, sugar, and biomass.\nRetail sales of lawn and garden tractors, compact utility tractors, residential and commercial mowers, utility vehicles, and golf and turf equipment are influenced by weather conditions, consumer spending patterns, and general economic conditions.\nSeasonality\n. Seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during the year. Seasonal demand must be estimated in advance, and equipment must be\n4\nmanufactured in anticipation of such demand to achieve efficient utilization of personnel and facilities throughout the year. For certain equipment, John Deere offers early order programs, which include discounts to retail customers that place orders well in advance of the use season. Production schedules are based, in part, on these early order programs. The production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf segments incur substantial seasonal variations in cash flows to finance production and inventory of agricultural and turf equipment. The segments also incur costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand. New combine and cotton harvesting equipment has been sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during non-use seasons. In Australia, Canada, and the U.S., there are typically several used equipment trade-in transactions that take place in connection with most new agricultural equipment sales. To provide support to its dealers in these countries for carrying and ultimately selling this used inventory to retail customers, John Deere provides these dealers with pools of funds awarded as a percentage of the dealer cost for eligible new equipment sales at the time of the new equipment settlement.\nRetail demand for turf and utility equipment is normally higher in the second and third fiscal quarters. John Deere has pursued a strategy of building and shipping such equipment as close to retail demand as possible. Consequently, to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories throughout the year, production and shipment schedules of these product lines are normally proportionately higher in the second and third fiscal quarters of each year, corresponding closely to the seasonal pattern of retail sales.\nConstruction and Forestry\nJohn Deere’s construction and forestry segment defines, develops, and delivers a broad range of machines and technology solutions organized along the earthmoving, forestry, and roadbuilding production systems. The segment’s primary products include a broad range of backhoe loaders, crawler dozers and loaders, four-wheel-drive loaders, excavators, motor graders, articulated dump trucks, landscape loaders, skid-steer loaders, milling machines, pavers, compactors, rollers, crushers, screens, asphalt plants, log skidders, log feller bunchers, log loaders, log forwarders, log harvesters, and a variety of attachments. John Deere provides a broad line of construction equipment and the most complete line of forestry machines and attachments available in the world. John Deere also manufactures and distributes roadbuilding equipment through its wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Wirtgen Group.\nThe construction and forestry segment’s products are distributed under the John Deere brand name, except for the Wirtgen Group products, which are manufactured and distributed under six brand names: Wirtgen, Vögele, Hamm, Kleemann, Benninghoven, and Ciber. Forestry attachments are distributed under the John Deere and Waratah brand names. In addition to the equipment manufactured by the construction and forestry segment, John Deere purchases certain products from other manufacturers for resale. The segment also provides advanced connectivity and telematics solutions designed to improve customer productivity, efficiency, and worksite management through access to fleet location, utilization, performance, and maintenance information.\nThe prevailing levels of residential, commercial, and public construction, investment in infrastructure, and the condition of the forestry products industry influence retail sales of John Deere construction, earthmoving, roadbuilding, material handling, and forestry equipment. General economic conditions, interest rate levels, the availability of credit, and certain commodity prices, such as oil and gas and those applicable to pulp, paper, and saw logs, also influence sales.\nBell Equipment Limited (Bell) distributes certain John Deere-manufactured construction equipment under the Bell brand in certain territories of Africa. Arrangements whereby Bell previously manufactured and sold certain John Deere-designed construction equipment and distributed John Deere-manufactured forestry equipment under the John Deere brand in specified territories of Africa were terminated in fiscal year 2021.\nJohn Deere and Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. (Hitachi) have a joint venture for the manufacture of hydraulic excavators and tracked forestry equipment in the U.S., Canada, and Brazil. Under the joint venture, John Deere distributes Hitachi brands of construction and mining equipment in North, Central, and South America. On August 19, 2021, the Company and Hitachi agreed to voluntarily terminate the joint venture. Following the termination, John Deere will continue to manufacture certain John Deere-branded excavators formerly manufactured by the joint venture and will additionally purchase certain John Deere-branded excavators, components, and service parts from Hitachi under a new supply agreement. The termination transaction is expected to close during the first half of fiscal year 2022, subject to the receipt of certain required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions.\nThe segment has a number of initiatives in the rent-to-rent, or short-term rental, market for construction, earthmoving, roadbuilding, and material handling equipment. These include specially designed rental programs for John Deere dealers and expanded cooperation with major national equipment rental companies.\nJohn Deere owns retail forestry sales operations in Australia, Brazil, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In addition, in many markets worldwide (most significantly in Europe, India, and Australia), the Wirtgen Group sells its products primarily through Company-owned sales and service subsidiaries.\n5\nCompetition\nThe equipment operations sell products and services into a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. The principal competitive factors in all markets include product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service, and price. In North America and many other parts of the world, John Deere’s brand recognition is a competitive factor.\nThe agricultural equipment industry continues to undergo significant changes and is becoming even more competitive through the emergence and expanding global capability of many competitors. The competitive environment for the agriculture and turf operations includes some global competitors, including AGCO Corporation, CLAAS KGaA mbH, CNH Industrial N.V., Kubota Tractor Corporation, Mahindra, and The Toro Company, as well as many regional and local competitors. These competitors have varying numbers of product lines competing with John Deere’s products and each has varying degrees of regional focus. Additional competition within the agricultural equipment industry has come from a variety of short-line and specialty manufacturers, as well as indigenous regional competitors, with differing manufacturing and marketing methods. As technology increasingly enables enhanced productivity in agriculture, the industry is also attracting non-traditional competitors, including technology-focused companies and start-up ventures. John Deere’s turf equipment is sold primarily in the competitive North American, Western European, and Australian markets.\nGlobal competitors of the construction and forestry segment include Caterpillar Inc., CNH Industrial N.V., Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd. and its subsidiary Doosan Bobcat Inc., Fayat Group, Komatsu Ltd., Kubota Tractor Corporation, Ponsse Plc, SANY Group Co., Ltd., Terex, Tigercat Industries Inc., Volvo Construction Equipment (part of Volvo Group AB), and XCMG. The construction business operates in competitive markets in North and South America as well as other global markets. The forestry and roadbuilding businesses operate globally. The segment manufactures over 90 percent of the types of construction equipment used in the U.S. and Canada, including construction, forestry, earthmoving, roadbuilding, and material handling equipment.\nManufacturing\nManufacturing Plants\n. In the U.S. and Canada, the equipment operations own and operate 21 factory locations and lease and operate another two locations. Of these 23 factories, eight are devoted primarily to production and precision agriculture equipment, five to small agriculture and turf equipment, four to construction and forestry equipment, one to engines, two to component remanufacturing, two to hydraulic and power train components, and one to electronic components. Outside the U.S. and Canada, the equipment operations own or lease and operate 44 factories, including: agriculture and turf equipment factories in Argentina, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia, and Spain; earthmoving equipment factories in Brazil and China; engine, engine/power train, hydraulic, or electronic component factories in Argentina, France, India, and Mexico; roadbuilding equipment factories in Brazil, China, Germany, and India; and forestry equipment factories in Finland and New Zealand. The engine factories referred to above manufacture non-road, heavy duty diesel engines.\nThe equipment operations also have financial interests in other manufacturing organizations, which include the Hitachi joint venture that builds hydraulic excavators and tracked forestry equipment in the U.S., Canada, and Brazil, and ventures that manufacture transaxles and transmissions used in certain agriculture and turf products. Following the expected closing of the termination of the Hitachi joint venture in the first half of fiscal 2022, John Deere will fully own and operate the factories formerly owned by the joint venture.\nJohn Deere’s facilities are well maintained, in good operating condition, and suitable for their present purposes. These facilities, together with both short-term and long-term planned capital expenditures, are expected to meet John Deere’s manufacturing needs in the foreseeable future.\nExisting capacity is sufficient to satisfy John Deere’s current expectations for retail market demand. The equipment operations’ manufacturing strategy involves the implementation of appropriate levels of technology and automation to allow manufacturing processes to remain profitable at varying production levels. Operations are also designed to be flexible enough to accommodate the product design changes required to meet market conditions and changing customer requirements. Common manufacturing facilities and techniques are employed in the production of components for production and precision agriculture equipment, small agriculture and turf equipment, and construction and forestry equipment.\nIn order to utilize manufacturing facilities and technology more effectively, the equipment operations pursue continuous improvements in manufacturing processes. These include steps to streamline manufacturing processes and enhance responsiveness to customers. John Deere’s flexible assembly lines can accommodate a wider product mix and deliver products in line with dealer and customer demand. Additionally, considerable effort is being directed to manufacturing cost reduction through process improvement and improvements in product design, advanced manufacturing technology, supply management and logistics, and environmental, health, and safety management systems, as well as compensation incentives related to productivity and organizational structure. John Deere has experienced volatility in the prices of many raw materials. John Deere has responded to cost pressures by implementing the cost-reduction measures described above and by increasing prices. Significant cost increases could have an adverse effect on the\n6\nCompany’s operating results. The equipment operations also pursue external sales of selected parts and components that can be manufactured and supplied to third parties on a competitive basis, including engines, power train components, and electronic components.\nPatents, Trademarks, Copyrights, and Trade Secrets\nJohn Deere owns a significant number of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and licenses related to John Deere products and services and expects the number to grow as John Deere continues to pursue technological innovations. John Deere’s policy is to further its competitive position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and internationally to protect technology and improvements considered important to the business. John Deere believes that, in the aggregate, the rights under these patents and licenses are generally important to its operations and competitive position, but does not regard any of its businesses as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents. However, certain John Deere trademarks, which contribute to John Deere’s identity and the recognition of its products and services, including but not limited to the “John Deere” mark, the leaping deer logo, the “Nothing Runs Like a Deere” slogan, the prefix “JD” associated with many products, and the green and yellow equipment colors, are an integral part of John Deere’s business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company. For additional information see Risk Factors\n–\nIntellectual Property Risks\n–\nThe potential loss of John Deere intellectual property through trade secret theft, infringement of patents, trademark counterfeiting, or other loss of rights to exclusive use of John Deere intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Infringement of the intellectual property rights of others by John Deere could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\n.\nMarketing\nIn the U.S. and Canada, the equipment operations distribute equipment and service parts through the following facilities: two agriculture and turf equipment sales and administration offices located in Olathe, Kansas and Cary, North Carolina and one sales branch located in Grimsby, Ontario; one construction, earthmoving, material handling, and forestry equipment sales and administration office located in Moline, Illinois and one sales branch located in Grimsby, Ontario; and one roadbuilding equipment sales, service, and administration office located in Nashville, Tennessee. In addition, the equipment operations operate two centralized parts distribution warehouses in coordination with nine regional parts depots and distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada.\nThrough these U.S. and Canadian facilities, John Deere markets products to approximately 1,990 independent dealer locations. Of these, approximately 1,545 sell agricultural equipment, while approximately 445 sell construction, earthmoving, material handling, roadbuilding, and/or forestry equipment. In addition, roadbuilding equipment is sold at approximately 125 roadbuilding-only locations that may carry products that compete with John Deere’s construction, earthmoving, material handling, and/or forestry equipment. Turf equipment is sold at most John Deere agricultural equipment locations, a few construction, earthmoving, material handling, roadbuilding, and/or forestry equipment locations, and about 340 turf-only locations, many of which also sell dissimilar lines of non-John Deere products. In addition, certain lawn and garden product lines are sold through The Home Depot and Lowe’s.\nOutside the U.S. and Canada, John Deere agriculture and turf equipment is sold to distributors and dealers for resale in over 100 countries. Sales and administrative offices are located in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. Turf equipment sales outside the U.S. and Canada occur primarily in Western Europe and Australia. Construction, earthmoving, material handling, and forestry equipment is sold to distributors and dealers primarily by sales offices located in Australia, Brazil, China, Finland, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. Some of these dealers are independently owned while John Deere owns others. Roadbuilding equipment is sold both directly to retail customers as well as to independent distributors and dealers for resale. The Wirtgen Group operates company-owned sales and service subsidiaries in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Guinea, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.\nThe equipment operations operate centralized parts distribution warehouses in Brazil, Germany, India, and Russia in coordination with regional parts depots and distribution centers in Argentina, Australia, China, Mexico, South Africa, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\nJohn Deere markets engines, power trains, and electronic components worldwide through select sales branches or directly to regional and global original equipment manufacturers and independently owned engine distributors.\nRaw Materials\nJohn Deere purchases raw materials and some manufactured components and replacement parts for its equipment, engines, and other products from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally. These materials and components include a variety of steel products, steel and iron castings, forgings, plastics, electronics, and ready-to-assemble components made to certain specifications. John Deere also purchases various goods and services used in production, logistics, offices, and research and development processes.\n7\nJohn Deere maintains strategic sourcing models to meet its production needs and build upon long-term supplier relationships. John Deere uses a variety of agreements with suppliers intended to drive innovation, ensure availability and delivery of industry-leading quality raw materials and components, manage costs on a globally competitive basis, protect John Deere’s intellectual property, and minimize other supply-related risks. Supply chain risks monitored by John Deere to minimize the likelihood of the supply base causing business disruption include supplier financial viability, capacity, business continuity, labor availability, quality, delivery, cybersecurity, and weather-related events, including natural disasters. In fiscal 2021, some of John Deere’s operations were affected by certain material or component shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID) and associated challenges, including those caused by industry capacity constraints, material availability, global logistics delays and constraints arising from, among other things, the transportation capacity of ocean shipping containers, and labor availability constraints. These challenges are expected to persist into at least the early part of fiscal year 2022.\nBacklog Orders\nThe dollar amount of backlog orders at October 31, 2021 believed to be firm was approximately $9.6 billion for the production and precision agriculture segment and $5.2 billion for the small agriculture and turf segment, compared with $4.9 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, at November 1, 2020. The agriculture and turf backlog is generally highest in the second and third quarters due to seasonal buying trends in these industries.\nThe dollar amount of backlog orders for the construction and forestry segment believed to be firm was approximately $6.7 billion at October 31, 2021, compared with $2.1 billion at November 1, 2020.\nBacklog orders for the equipment operations include all orders deemed to be firm as of the referenced date.\nTrade Accounts and Notes Receivable\nTrade accounts and notes receivable arise primarily from sales of goods to independent dealers. Most trade receivables originated by the equipment operations are purchased by the financial services operations. The equipment operations compensate the financial services operations at approximate market rates of interest for these receivables. Additional information appears in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFINANCIAL SERVICES\nU.S. and Canada\n. The financial services segment primarily provides and administers financing for retail purchases from John Deere dealers of new equipment manufactured by John Deere’s production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry segments and used equipment taken in trade for this equipment.\nThe Company and John Deere Construction & Forestry Company (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) are referred to as the “sales companies.” John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation), a U.S. financial services subsidiary, generally purchases retail installment sales and loan contracts (retail notes) from the sales companies. These retail notes are acquired by the sales companies through John Deere retail dealers in the U.S. John Deere Financial Inc., a Canadian financial services subsidiary, purchases and finances retail notes acquired by John Deere Canada ULC, John Deere’s Canadian sales company. The terms of retail notes and the basis on which the financial services operations acquire retail notes from the sales companies are governed by agreements with the sales companies. The financial services segment also finances and services revolving charge accounts, in most cases acquired from and offered through merchants in the agriculture and turf and construction and forestry markets (revolving charge accounts). Additionally, the financial services operations provide wholesale financing to dealers of John Deere agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment (wholesale notes), primarily to finance inventories of equipment for those dealers. The various financing options offered by the financial services operations are designed to enhance sales of John Deere products and generate financing income for the financial services operations. In the U.S. and Canada, certain subsidiaries included in the financial services segment offer extended equipment warranties.\nRetail notes acquired by the sales companies are immediately sold to the financial services operations. The equipment operations are the financial services operations’ major source of business, although many retail purchasers of John Deere products finance their purchases outside the John Deere organization through a variety of sources, including commercial banks and finance and leasing companies.\nThe financial services operations offer retail leases to equipment users in the U.S. A small number of leases are executed with units of local governments. Leases are usually written for periods ranging from less than one year to seven years, and typically contain an option permitting the customer to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term. Retail leases are also offered in a generally similar manner to customers in Canada through John Deere Financial Inc. and John Deere Canada ULC.\nThe financial services operations’ terms for financing equipment retail sales (other than smaller items financed with unsecured revolving charge accounts) generally provide for retention of a security interest in the equipment financed. The financial services operations’ guidelines for minimum down payments, which vary with the types of equipment financed and repayment provisions, generally range from 0 percent to 20 percent of the purchase price. Finance charges are sometimes waived for specified periods or\n8\nreduced on certain John Deere products sold or leased in advance of the season of use or in other sales promotions. The financial services operations generally receive compensation from the sales companies at approximate market interest rates for periods during which finance charges are waived or reduced on the retail notes or leases. The cost is accounted for as a deduction in arriving at net sales by the equipment operations.\nThe Company has an agreement with Capital Corporation to make payments to Capital Corporation such that its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for any fiscal quarter. The Company has also committed to continuing to own, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to maintain Capital Corporation’s consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50 million. The Company’s obligations to make payments to Capital Corporation under the agreement are independent of whether Capital Corporation is in default on its indebtedness, obligations, or other liabilities. Further, the Company’s obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of Capital Corporation’s indebtedness, obligations, or other liabilities. The Company’s obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation, or liability of Capital Corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. The Company was in compliance with all of its obligations under this agreement as of October 31, 2021, and no payments were required under this agreement in fiscal 2021 or 2020. At October 31, 2021, the Company indirectly owned 100 percent of the voting shares of Capital Corporation’s capital stock and Capital Corporation’s consolidated tangible net worth was $4,524 million.\nOutside the U.S. and Canada\n. The financial services operations also offer financing, primarily for John Deere products, in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Thailand, and in several other countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. In certain markets, financing is offered through cooperation agreements or joint ventures with other financial institutions. The manner in which the financial services operations offer financing in these countries is affected by a variety of country-specific laws, regulations, and customs, including those governing property rights and debtor obligations, that are subject to change and that may introduce greater risk to the financial services operations.\nThe financial services operations also offer to select customers and dealers credit enhanced international export financing primarily for the purchase of John Deere products.\nAdditional information on the financial services operations appears on pages 27 – 30 and 34.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nJohn Deere is subject to a wide variety of local, state, and federal environmental laws and regulations in the U.S., as well as the environmental laws and regulations of other countries in which John Deere conducts business. John Deere strives to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations, however, could lead to fines and other penalties. John Deere is involved in the evaluation and clean-up of a limited number of sites but does not expect that these matters or other expenses or liabilities John Deere may incur in connection with any noncompliance with environmental laws or regulations or the cleanup of any additional properties will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or competitive position. With respect to properties and businesses that have been or will be acquired, John Deere conducts due diligence into potential exposure to environmental liabilities, but cannot be certain that it has identified or will identify all adverse environmental conditions. Compliance with these laws and regulations has added, and will continue to add, to the cost of John Deere’s products. The Company does not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during fiscal 2022.\nThe European Union’s Stage V Regulation, parts of which became effective in 2019 and 2020, applies to non-road diesel engines across various power categories for machines used in construction, agriculture, material handling, industrial use, and generator applications. Governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting similar laws to reduce off-road engine emissions, including India’s Bharat Stage IV Regulation that became effective in 2021. These standards continue the reduction of particulate and NOx emissions. John Deere has achieved and plans to continue to achieve compliance with these regulations through significant investments in the development of new engine technologies and after-treatment systems. Compliance with emissions regulations has added and will continue to add to the cost of John Deere’s products.\nGovernments are also implementing laws regulating products across their life cycles, including raw material sourcing and the storage, distribution, sale, use, and disposal of products at their end-of-life.  These laws and regulations include green chemistry, right-to-know, restriction of hazardous substances, and product take-back laws.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATIONS\nJohn Deere is subject to a wide variety of local, state, and federal laws and regulations in the countries where it conducts business. Compliance with these laws and regulations often requires the dedication of time and effort of employees, as well as financial resources. In fiscal 2021, compliance with the regulations applicable to John Deere did not have a material effect on John Deere’s capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. The Company does not expect to incur material capital expenditures related to\n9\ncompliance with regulations during fiscal year 2022. Additional information about the impact of government regulations on John Deere’s business is included in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” under the headings Geopolitical Uncertainties; Data Security and Privacy Risks; Environmental, Climate, and Weather Risks; and Legal and Regulatory Risks.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nHigher Purpose\nJohn Deere’s employees, its human capital, are guided by the Company’s higher purpose:\nWe run so life can leap forward\n. Employees are further guided by the Company’s code of business conduct (Code), which helps them to uphold and strengthen the standards of honor and integrity that have defined John Deere since its founding. Our world and business may change, but our core values—integrity, quality, commitment, and innovation—are a constant in everything we do. Our values have shaped and guided our vision since 1837.\nEmployees\nAt October 31, 2021, John Deere had approximately 75,600 employees, including approximately 29,000 employees in the U.S. and Canada. John Deere also retains consultants, independent contractors, and temporary and part-time workers. Unions are certified as bargaining agents for approximately 83 percent of John Deere’s U.S. production and maintenance employees. Approximately 10,500 of John Deere’s active U.S. production and maintenance workers are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), with an expiration date of November 1, 2027. A small number of U.S. production employees are represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). Collective bargaining agreements covering John Deere’s employees in the U.S., other than the agreement with the UAW, expire between 2022 and 2027. Unions also represent the majority of employees at John Deere manufacturing facilities outside the U.S. There is no guarantee that John Deere will be able to renew collective bargaining agreements or whether such agreements will be on terms satisfactory to John Deere. For further discussion, see Risk Factors-Human Capital Risks-\nDisputes with labor unions have adversely affected John Deere’s ability to operate its facilities as well as its financial results\n.\nCode of Business Conduct\nJohn Deere is committed to conducting business in accordance with the highest ethical standards. This means how we conduct ourselves and our global work is more than just a matter of policy and law; it's a reflection of our core values. The Code, refreshed in 2021, provides specific guidance to all John Deere employees, outlining how they can and must uphold and strengthen the integrity that has defined John Deere since its founding. All employees must complete Code training and, where permitted by law, must also certify each year that they will comply with the Code. The Company maintains a global compliance hotline to allow for concerns to be brought forward.\nHealth and Safety\nJohn Deere strives to achieve safety excellence through increased focus on leading indicators, risk reduction, health and safety management systems, and prevention. John Deere utilizes a safety balanced scorecard, which includes leading and lagging indicators and is designed to enable continuous measurement of safety performance and drive continuous improvement. Leading indicators include injury/illness corrective action closure rates, near-miss corrective action closure rates, and risk reduction from safety and ergonomic risk assessment projects. Lagging indicators include total recordable incident rate, ergonomic recordable case rate, and near-miss rate. Leading indicators are tracked by most of John Deere’s manufacturing facilities and internally reported. John Deere reported a total recordable incident rate of 1.99 and a lost time frequency rate of .78 in fiscal 2021.\nJohn Deere has taken and continues to take extraordinary measures to protect its workforce in response to COVID. Safety protocols continue to be in place for employees who are required to work onsite, including divider screens and enhanced cleaning and sanitation. Where possible, John Deere has supported flexible work arrangements for employees throughout the pandemic, including by deploying new technologies to strengthen virtual connectivity. John Deere also provided financial support for employees who struggled to provide childcare during the pandemic. John Deere continues to strive to be agile in addressing employee needs in the quickly evolving environment while also being transparent across the workforce.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)\nIn order to ensure that each of our employees can bring their full selves to work, John Deere strives to foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace where all voices are heard and included. John Deere continues to champion policies, practices, and behaviors that amplify innovation on behalf of people, community, and planet. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are critical to John Deere’s success as an organization. Incorporating DEI into our business practices enhances innovation and enables our best talent to thrive in an environment where diverse perspectives are celebrated. This requires deliberate intention and action on the part of every employee\n10\nand leader. We will continue to push forward on the path to a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture with our colleagues, customers, suppliers, and distribution channels. In doing so, experience tells us we will be more engaged, innovative, and successful.\nJohn Deere leadership sets a consistent and transparent tone on diversity and inclusion. Leadership training focuses on building an inclusive environment and driving positive behavioral change. To help managers with development and team building, we measure inclusiveness as part of our employee experience survey. We are working to further weave DEI into all aspects of how we lead and do business. In addition to regional councils, we have formed a global diversity and inclusion council with senior leaders who own our DEI journey. This journey is a collective effort that involves every level of our organization. As part of the annual sustainability report available on our website, John Deere has publicly disclosed the number of women and minorities in leadership positions and continues to launch initiatives to increase representation of minorities in the workforce.\nJohn Deere proudly partners with several professional organizations to support our diversity recruitment strategy, including the National Black MBA Association, Inc., the Society of Women Engineers, the Thurgood Marshall College Fund Leadership Institute, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and Minorities in Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Related Sciences.\nOur Company-sponsored employee resource groups (ERGs) are employee-run organizations formed around a common dimension of diversity, interest, or experience that affects the workplace. ERGs bring together individuals with shared interests while serving as resources to our business. The efforts of our ERGs address three key focus areas – employee development, community involvement, and business alignment. John Deere has 12 ERGs with more than 7,500 employees engaged globally.\nCompensation & Benefits\nTo attract and retain talent, John Deere offers competitive compensation and non-financial benefits everywhere we operate. These benefits are tailored to the markets in which our employees are located. The non-compensation benefits we offer focus on all aspects of employee well-being, including physical, social, community, and career. We conduct regular surveys of the market rates for jobs to ensure our compensation is competitive. We offer a variety of working arrangements, including flexible schedules, telecommuting, and job sharing, to help employees manage home and work-life situations.\nTraining and Development\nJohn Deere provides training and development opportunities for employees at all stages of their careers to empower them to reach their full potential. Employees are critical to the long-term success of John Deere’s business. We encourage employees to identify the paths that can build the skills, experience, knowledge, and competencies needed for career advancement. John Deere supports employees by creating purpose-driven work opportunities, comprehensive performance reviews and development plans, mentoring opportunities, and professional and personal development opportunities. John Deere provided approximately 19.5 training hours per full time equivalent administrative/professional employee globally in fiscal 2021. John Deere’s training programs, which are tailored to different geographic regions and job functions, include among other topics technical operation of equipment, equipment assembly, relationships with customers and dealers, John Deere’s culture and values, compliance with the Code, compliance with anti-bribery/corruption laws and policies, compliance with management of private data and cybersecurity, conflicts of interest, discrimination and workplace harassment policies, and sexual harassment policies.\nHuman Rights\nJohn Deere honors human rights and respects the individual dignity of all persons globally. Our commitment to human rights requires that we understand and carry out our responsibilities consistent with Company values and practices. We strive to ensure that human rights are upheld for our employees and all workers in our supply chain. Our commitment to human rights is defined in the Code, our supplier code of conduct, our dealer code of conduct, and related policies and practices, which establish clear guidelines for our employees, suppliers, and dealers while helping to inform our business decisions. We do not tolerate human rights abuses, such as forced labor, unlawful child labor, or human trafficking. We are proud to contribute to the places where we work and support the residents of these places.\n​\n11\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nFollowing are the names and ages of the executive officers of the Company, their positions with the Company, and summaries of their backgrounds and business experiences.

    "text": "The following risks are considered material to John Deere’s business based upon current knowledge, information, and assumptions. This discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page 27, including the risks and uncertainties described in the Safe Harbor Statement on pages 37 – 39, and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 49. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements that relate to future events, expectations, trends, and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the Company’s businesses. Although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The Company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factors discussion, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the “Safe Harbor Statement” in this report are not the only risks faced by the Company.\nRisks Related to the COVID Pandemic\nThe COVID pandemic resulted in additional risks that could materially adversely affect John Deere’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows.\nThe virus causing COVID was identified in late 2019 and spread globally (COVID pandemic). Efforts to combat the virus have been complicated by viral variants and uneven access to, and acceptance and effectiveness of, vaccines globally. The pandemic resulted in governments and other authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and business closures. These measures have impacted and may continue to impact all or portions of John Deere’s workforce and operations and the operations of customers, dealers, and suppliers. Although certain restrictions related to the COVID pandemic have eased, uncertainty continues to exist regarding such measures and potential future measures. Current material and component shortages have limited and could continue to limit John Deere’s ability to meet customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nThe COVID pandemic caused a global recession and the sustainability of the economic recovery observed in 2021 remains unclear. The COVID pandemic has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, has caused inflationary pressure in the U.S. and elsewhere, and has led to disruption and volatility in demand for John Deere’s products and services, suppliers’ ability to fill orders, and global capital markets. Economic uncertainties could continue to affect demand for John Deere’s products and services, the value of the equipment financed or leased, the demand for financing, and the financial condition and credit risk of John Deere’s dealers and customers.\nContinued uncertainties related to the magnitude, duration, and persistent effects of the COVID pandemic may significantly adversely affect our business and outlook. These uncertainties include, among other things: the duration and impact of the resurgence in COVID cases in any country, state, or region; the emergence, contagiousness, and threat of new and different strains of virus; the availability, acceptance, and effectiveness of vaccines; additional closures or other actions as mandated or otherwise made necessary by governmental authorities, including employee vaccine mandates; disruptions in the supply chain, including those caused by industry capacity constraints, material availability, and global logistics delays and constraints arising from, among other things, the transportation capacity of ocean shipping containers, and a prolonged delay in resumption of operations by one or more key suppliers, or the failure of any key supplier; an increasingly competitive labor market due to a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover caused by the COVID pandemic; John Deere’s ability to meet commitments to customers on a timely basis as a result of increased costs and supply and transportation challenges; increased logistics costs; additional operating costs due to continued remote working arrangements, adherence to social distancing guidelines, and other COVID-related challenges; increased risk of cyberattacks on network connections used in remote working arrangements; increased privacy-related risks due to processing health-related personal information; legal claims related to personal protective equipment designed, made, or provided by John Deere or alleged exposure to COVID on John Deere premises; absence of employees due to illness; and the impact of the pandemic on John Deere’s customers and dealers. These factors, and others that are currently unknown or considered immaterial, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial position.\n​\n13\nGeopolitical Uncertainties\nInternational, national, and regional trade laws, regulations, and policies (particularly those related to or restricting global trade) and government farm programs and policies could significantly impair John Deere’s profitability and growth prospects.\nInternational, national, and regional laws, regulations, and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of John Deere’s products, services, and technology, or those of our customers, including protectionist policies in particular jurisdictions or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm John Deere’s global business. John Deere’s profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace. Restricted access to global markets impairs John Deere’s ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world and limits the ability to access raw materials and high-quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. Trade restrictions, including withdrawal from or modification of existing trade agreements, negotiation of new trade agreements, non-tariff trade barriers, local content requirements, and imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, including developments in U.S.-China trade relations, could limit John Deere’s ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair John Deere’s ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products, and services. These trade restrictions, and changes in–or uncertainty surrounding–global trade policies, may affect John Deere’s competitive position. Furthermore, market access and the ability to export agricultural and forestry commodities is critical to John Deere’s agricultural and forestry customers. Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. John Deere’s agricultural equipment sales could be especially harmed by such policies because farm income strongly influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world. Furthermore, trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact John Deere’s future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel, and infrastructure. Additionally, changes in government farm programs and policies, including direct payment and other subsidies, can significantly influence demand for agricultural equipment as well as create unequal competition for multinational companies relative to domestic companies.\nEmbargoes, sanctions, and export controls imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting transactions with certain persons or entities, including financial institutions, to certain countries or regions, or involving certain products, limit the sales of John Deere products. Embargoes, sanctions, and export control laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies, including with respect to China, Russia, Myanmar (Burma), and Belarus. In particular, changing U.S. export controls and sanctions on China, as well as other restrictions affecting transactions involving China and Chinese parties, could affect John Deere’s ability to collect receivables, provide aftermarket and warranty support for John Deere equipment, and sell products, and otherwise impact John Deere’s reputation and business. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions, violations of these laws or sanctions could harm John Deere’s reputation and business, and may subject John Deere to civil and criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on John Deere’s results of operations and financial condition.\nGreater political, economic, and social uncertainty and the evolving globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of John Deere’s competition, customer base, and product offerings and impact John Deere’s growth opportunities globally.\nJohn Deere’s efforts to grow its businesses depend in part upon access to additional geographic markets, including, but not limited to, Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Russia, and South Africa, and its success in developing market share and operating profitably in such markets. In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, and differing local customer product preferences and requirements than John Deere’s other markets. Negative market conditions resulting from economic and political uncertainties in these and other countries could reduce customer confidence, resulting in declines in demand and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could affect write-offs and provisions for credit losses. Operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes John Deere to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices, business practices, and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change and are often complex and difficult to navigate, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, sanctions and export control requirements, repatriation of earnings, and advanced technologies. Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations, which can materially affect the Company’s financial results. While John Deere maintains a positive corporate image and its brands are widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets, the brands are less well known in some emerging markets, which could impede John Deere’s efforts to successfully compete in these markets. Although John Deere is taking measures to adapt to these changing circumstances, John Deere’s reputation and/or business results could be negatively affected should these efforts prove unsuccessful.\n14\nUncertain Economic Conditions\nNegative economic conditions and outlook can materially weaken demand for John Deere’s equipment and services, limit access to funding, and result in higher funding costs.\nThe demand for John Deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, cautious consumer spending, lower corporate earnings, U.S. budget issues, and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions that cause John Deere’s customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing John Deere’s equipment. As discussed under Risks Related to the COVID Pandemic–\nThe COVID pandemic resulted in additional risks that could materially adversely affect John Deere’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows\n, the COVID pandemic caused a global recession and significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. Sustained negative economic conditions and outlook affect housing starts, energy demand, and other construction, which dampens demand for certain construction equipment. John Deere’s turf operations and its construction and forestry business are dependent on construction activity and general economic conditions. Decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on John Deere’s results of operations. If negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on John Deere’s agricultural equipment sales. In addition, uncertain or negative outlook with respect to pervasive U.S. fiscal issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook can cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce the Company’s earnings and cash flows. Additionally, the Company’s investment management activities could be adversely affected by changes in the equity and bond markets, which would negatively affect earnings.\nIn addition, demand for John Deere’s products and services can be significantly reduced by concerns regarding the diverse economic and political circumstances of the individual countries in the eurozone, the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the risk that one or more other European Union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the European Union, or the long term stability of the euro as a single common currency. Persistent disparity with respect to the widely varying economic conditions within the individual countries in the eurozone, and its implications for the euro as well as market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of John Deere’s euro-denominated assets and obligations, have an adverse effect on demand for John Deere’s products and services in the eurozone, and have an adverse effect on financial markets in Europe and globally. More specifically, it could affect the ability of John Deere’s customers, suppliers, and lenders to finance their respective businesses and access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, as well as the availability of supplies and materials and the demand for John Deere’s products.\nFinancial Risks\nChanges in government banking, monetary, and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on John Deere.\nPolicies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary, and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity, stabilize financial markets, and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on John Deere’s customers and markets. Failure of the U.S. federal government to pass a 2022 budget resolution could lead to a U.S. default under its sovereign debt, the consequences of which could have significant and unpredictable effects on global financial markets, which could in turn negatively affect John Deere’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. John Deere’s operations and results could also be affected by financial regulatory reform that could have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on John Deere’s customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of John Deere products. Government policies on spending can also affect John Deere, especially the construction and forestry segment, due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development. John Deere’s operations, including those outside of the United States, may also be affected by non-U.S. regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate non-U.S. financial institutions and markets.\nChanges in tax rates, tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on John Deere.\nJohn Deere is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. John Deere’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. John Deere’s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretations. If John Deere’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of its taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, John Deere’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n15\nThe Company’s consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in the currencies of other countries, creating currency exchange and translation risk.\nJohn Deere operates in many areas of the world, involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. John Deere is subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that its costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which John Deere earns revenues.\nAdditionally, the reporting currency for the Company’s consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of John Deere’s assets, liabilities, expenses, and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses, and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Therefore, increases or decreases in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currencies. Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on John Deere’s results.\nBecause the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere’s sales worldwide, negative economic conditions in the financial industry could materially impact John Deere’s operations and financial results.\nNegative economic conditions can have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of John Deere’s sales worldwide. The financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations and may experience credit losses that exceed its expectations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The financial services segment’s inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to support its financing activities could have a material adverse effect on John Deere’s business. The financial services segment’s liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the financial services segment’s write-offs and provision for credit losses. The financial services segment may also experience residual value losses that exceed its expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher-than-expected equipment returns at lease maturity.\nBecause John Deere’s equipment operations and financial services segment are subject to interest rate risks, changes in interest rates can reduce demand for equipment, adversely affect interest margins, and limit access to capital markets while increasing borrowing costs.\nRising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of John Deere’s customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for John Deere equipment and customers’ ability to repay obligations to John Deere. In addition, credit market dislocations could have an impact on funding costs, which are very important to the financial services segment because such costs affect the segment’s ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. While the Company strives to match the interest rate characteristics of its financial assets and liabilities, changing interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Company’s net interest rate margin—the difference between the yield the Company earns on its assets and the interest rates the Company pays for funding, which could in turn affect the Company’s net interest income and earnings. Actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for the Company and can increase the Company’s cost of capital and hurt its competitive position.\nThe transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and the adoption of alternative reference rates could adversely affect John Deere’s business and results of operations.\nJohn Deere is exposed to LIBOR-based financial instruments, primarily relating to debt, derivative, and receivables transactions, that have been entered into previously and remain outstanding. The LIBOR benchmark has been subject of national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In November 2020, the Intercontinental Exchange announced its intention to cease publication of certain LIBOR settings by the end of 2021 while continuing to publish overnight and one-, three-, six-, and twelve-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates through June 30, 2023. However, in early 2021, the United States Federal Reserve Board and other regulatory bodies issued guidance encouraging banks and other financial market participants to cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event no later than December 31, 2021. These actions may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past and LIBOR will likely ultimately cease to exist.\nTo facilitate an orderly transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmark rate(s), John Deere has established an initiative led by internal subject matter experts to assess and mitigate risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR. As part of this initiative, several alternative benchmark rates have been, and continue to be, evaluated. At this time, however, the effects of the phase out of LIBOR and the adoption of alternative benchmark rates have not been fully determined. Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate\n16\nLIBOR exactly, which could affect John Deere’s contracts that mature after a LIBOR cessation date. In addition, there is uncertainty about how applicable laws, the courts, or John Deere will address the replacement of LIBOR with alternative rates on variable rate contracts that do not include, or contain unclear, alternative rate fallback provisions. A failure to properly transition away from LIBOR could expose John Deere to various financial, operational, and regulatory risks, which could affect its results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for the Company’s securities.\nSustained increases in funding obligations under the Company’s pension plans may impair the Company’s liquidity or financial condition.\nThe Company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees, which impose funding obligations. The Company uses many assumptions in calculating its future payment obligations under these plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of return on pension investments being lower than expected. The Company may be required to make significant contributions to its pension plans in the future. These factors could significantly increase the Company’s payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nMarket Conditions\nJohn Deere’s ability to adapt in highly competitive markets could affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nJohn Deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets. John Deere competes worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. John Deere competes on the basis of product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, customer service, and price. Aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays, or John Deere’s failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nJohn Deere’s ability to understand its customers’ specific preferences and requirements, and to develop, manufacture, and market products that meet customer demand, could significantly affect its business results.\nJohn Deere’s ability to match new product offerings to diverse global customers’ anticipated preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to its success. This requires a thorough understanding of John Deere’s existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in growth markets such as Argentina, Brazil, and India. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on John Deere’s business.\nChanging worldwide demand for food and different forms of bio-energy could affect the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for certain John Deere equipment and could also result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements.\nChanging worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the world’s growing food and bio-energy demands, driven in part by government policies, including those related to climate change, and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. Lower agricultural commodity prices directly affect farm incomes, which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment and result in higher credit losses. While higher commodity prices benefit John Deere’s crop-producing agricultural equipment customers, higher commodity prices also could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers, which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. Furthermore, changing bio-energy demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect commodity demand and commodity prices, demand for John Deere’s diesel-fueled equipment, and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards.\nManufacturing and Operations\nChanges in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components, and whole goods could result in significant disruptions to the supply chain, production disruptions, and increased costs and lower profits on sales of John Deere products.\nJohn Deere requires access to various raw materials, components, and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute its products. Changes in the availability and prices of these raw materials, components, and whole goods, which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility, regulatory instability, or change in import tariffs or trade agreements, can significantly increase the costs of production, which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly if John Deere, due to pricing considerations or other factors, is unable to recover the increased costs from its customers. Significant disruptions to the supply chain resulting from shortages of raw materials, components,\n17\nand whole goods can adversely affect John Deere’s ability to meet commitments to customers. John Deere relies on suppliers to acquire raw materials, components, and whole goods required to manufacture its products.\nCertain components and parts used in John Deere’s products are available from a single supplier and cannot be alternatively sourced quickly.\nAs discussed under Item 1, “Construction and Forestry,” the Company agreed to voluntarily terminate its joint venture agreement with Hitachi in a transaction that is expected to close in the first half of fiscal 2022. In connection with this termination, John Deere Construction & Forestry Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has entered into a supply agreement with Hitachi pursuant to which Hitachi will continue to provide John Deere-branded excavators, components, and service parts. Any delay or failure by Hitachi to deliver these supplies, or failure by Hitachi to produce such supplies in a manner that meets John Deere’s quality and quantity requirements, could adversely affect John Deere’s business, results of operations, cash flow, and financial condition or its ability to meet commitments to its customers.\nIn 2020, the COVID pandemic caused a significant reduction in global demand for goods, resulting in widespread cuts in manufacturing capacity and the displacement of workers. As economies around the world have reopened in 2021, sharp increases in demand have created significant disruptions to the global supply chain, which have affected John Deere’s ability to receive goods on a timely basis and at anticipated costs. These supply chain disruptions have been caused and compounded by many factors, including changes in supply and demand, industry capacity constraints, weather conditions, natural disasters, business continuity, labor shortages, the COVID pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and trade conflicts. Global logistics network challenges include shortages of shipping containers, ocean freight capacity constraints, international port delays, trucking and chassis shortages, railway and air freight capacity, and labor availability constraints, which have resulted in delays, shortages of key manufacturing components, increased order backlogs, and increased transportation costs. John Deere actively monitors and mitigates supply chain risk, but there can be no assurance that our mitigation plans will be effective to prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages of materials that we use in the production of our products. Uncertainties related to the magnitude and duration of global supply chain disruptions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, John Deere’s business and outlook.\nSupply chain disruptions due to pandemic events, including the COVID pandemic, supplier financial distress, capacity constraints, trade barriers, labor shortages, business continuity, quality, cyberattacks, energy supply, delivery issues, or disruptions due to weather-related events or natural disasters could affect John Deere’s operations and profitability.\nData Security and Privacy Risks\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to John Deere’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with John Deere’s operations and could compromise the information of John Deere as well as its customers, suppliers, and/or dealers, exposing John Deere to liability that could cause John Deere’s business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of business, John Deere relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, and collection of payments from dealers and other purchasers of John Deere equipment and from customers of the financial services segment. John Deere uses information technology systems to record, process, and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Additionally, John Deere collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and the proprietary business information of John Deere’s customers, suppliers, and dealers, as well as personally identifiable information of John Deere’s customers and employees, in data centers, which are often owned by third parties, and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to John Deere’s business operations and strategy. Despite security measures, including a vulnerability disclosure program, and business continuity plans, John Deere’s information technology networks and infrastructure have been and may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee, supplier, or dealer error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. Although John Deere has not suffered any significant cyber incidents that resulted in material business impact, we have from time to time been the target of malicious cyber threat actors. The occurrence of any significant event could compromise John Deere’s networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disruption to John Deere’s operations, and damage John Deere’s reputation, which could adversely affect John Deere’s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, John Deere may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of its systems.\n18\nJohn Deere is subject to governmental laws, regulations, and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection and any inability or perceived inability of John Deere to address these requirements could adversely affect our business.\nThe legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. John Deere collects personal information and other data as integral parts of its business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory and other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union, China, Canada, and other relevant jurisdictions where John Deere conducts business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal information and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the China Personal Information Protection Law, among others, impose stringent data protection requirements and provide significant penalties for noncompliance. New privacy laws will continue to come into effect around the world in the future. Any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations (including at newly acquired companies) could result in additional cost and liability to the Company or Company officials, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and otherwise adversely affect our business\n.\nSecurity breaches with respect to John Deere’s products could interfere with the business of John Deere, its dealers, and/or customers, exposing John Deere to liability that would cause its business and reputation to suffer.\nSome of John Deere’s products include connectivity hardware typically used for remote system updates. While John Deere has implemented security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to its products, malicious actors have reportedly attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to such products through such connectivity hardware in order to gain control of the products, change the products’ functionality, user interface, or performance characteristics, or gain access to data stored in or generated by the products. Any unauthorized access to or control of John Deere products or systems or any loss of data could result in legal claims against John Deere or government investigations. In addition, reports of unauthorized access to John Deere’s products, systems, and data, regardless of their veracity, may result in the perception that the products, systems, or data are capable of being hacked, which could harm John Deere’s brand, prospects, and operating results. John Deere has been the subject of such reports in the past.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nThe potential loss of John Deere intellectual property through trade secret theft, infringement of patents, trademark counterfeiting, or other loss of rights to exclusive use of John Deere intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Infringement of the intellectual property rights of others by John Deere could also have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nJohn Deere relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, and confidentiality agreements to protect its intellectual property rights. In particular, John Deere heavily relies on certain trademarks that contribute to John Deere’s identity and the recognition of its products and services, including but not limited to the “John Deere” mark, the leaping deer logo, the “Nothing Runs Like a Deere” slogan, the prefix “JD” associated with many products, and the green and yellow equipment colors. These trademarks, as well as the many patents used in our products, are integral to the John Deere business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nAdditionally, third parties may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of John Deere’s patents or allege that John Deere infringes their patents. John Deere may incur substantial costs if its competitors or other third parties initiate such litigation, or if John Deere initiates any proceedings to protect its proprietary rights. If the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to John Deere, our business could be adversely affected. Similarly, disputes may arise regarding whether John Deere’s products or technologies infringe the proprietary rights of others. Any such infringement could cause third parties, including our competitors, to bring claims against John Deere, resulting in significant costs, possible damages, and substantial uncertainty.\nHuman Capital Risks\nJohn Deere’s ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified employees could affect its ability to execute its strategy.\nJohn Deere’s continued success depends, in part, on its ability to identify and attract qualified candidates with the requisite education, background, and experience as well as its ability to develop, engage, and retain qualified employees. Failure to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified employees, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new employees, or inadequate resources to train, integrate, and retain qualified employees, could impair John Deere’s ability to execute its business strategy, and could adversely affect John Deere’s business. In addition, while John Deere strives to reduce the impact of the departure of employees, John Deere’s operations or ability to execute its business strategy and meet its business objectives may be affected by the loss of employees, particularly when departures involve larger numbers of employees, such as those John Deere could experience if a surge occurs in the number of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs similar to that experienced by\n19\nother employers and industries since 2020. Higher rates of employee separations may adversely affect John Deere through decreased employee morale, the loss of knowledge of departing employees, and the devotion of resources to recruiting and onboarding new employees.\nDisputes with labor unions have adversely affected John Deere’s ability to operate its facilities as well as its financial results.\nMany of John Deere’s production and maintenance employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements with different expiration dates. The failure of John Deere to successfully renegotiate labor agreements as they expire has from time to time led, and could in the future lead, to work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions. Disruptions to John Deere’s manufacturing and parts-distribution facilities, through various forms of labor disputes, adversely affect the Company. On October 14, 2021, after employees represented by the UAW failed to approve a new collective bargaining agreement between John Deere and the UAW, the UAW initiated a labor strike affecting more than 10,000 workers at 14 John Deere facilities across the U.S., which adversely affected John Deere’s operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The strike ended after a new collective bargaining agreement was approved on November 17, 2021. The UAW strike is expected to have an adverse effect on John Deere’s results of operations for the three months ending January 30, 2022 as a result of reduced production and shipments. Any strike, work stoppage, or other dispute with a labor union distracts management from operating the business, may displace employees from ordinary job positions to fill in vacant positions, may affect John Deere’s reputation, and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nEnvironmental, Climate, and Weather Risks\nUnfavorable weather conditions or natural calamities that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment could directly and indirectly affect John Deere’s business.\nPoor or unusual weather conditions, particularly during the planting and early growing season, can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of John Deere’s customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Insufficient levels of rain prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields. Excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth. Temperatures outside normal ranges can also cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence. Temperature affects the rate of growth, maturity, and quality of crops. Natural calamities such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, droughts, diseases, and pests can have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production. The resulting negative impact on farm income can strongly affect demand for agricultural equipment and the financial condition and credit risk of John Deere’s dealers and customers. Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region, particularly during the important spring selling season, may adversely affect sales of some turf equipment. Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and unusually rainy weather can similarly cause lower sales volumes.\nIncreasingly rigorous environmental,\nhealth, and safety laws and regulations\nof federal, state, and local authorities in the U.S. and various regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions apply to John Deere’s operations, suppliers, and customers, and enforcement actions or civil litigation related to those requirements could adversely affect John Deere’s business results.\nEnforcement actions arising from violations of environmental, health, and safety laws or regulations can lead to investigations and legal costs and result in significant fines or penalties. In addition, new or more stringent requirements of governmental authorities, including with respect to disclosure relating to climate change risks, could prevent or restrict John Deere’s operations or those of our suppliers and customers, require significant expenditures to achieve compliance, and/or give rise to civil or criminal liability. Further, civil litigation on these subjects continues to increase, primarily in the U.S. There can be no assurance that violations of such laws and/or regulations, civil claims for damages to property or personal injury arising from the environmental, health, or safety impacts of John Deere’s operations or those of our suppliers and customers, or other civil claims in which John Deere becomes a party, would not have consequences that result in a material adverse effect on John Deere’s business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIncreasingly stringent engine emission regulations or bans on internal combustion engines could impact John Deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment, which could negatively affect business results.\nJohn Deere’s equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction regulations throughout the world, including the European Union’s Stage V standard. In addition, governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce off-road engine emissions. These laws and regulations are applicable to engines manufactured by John Deere, including those used in John Deere agriculture and construction and forestry equipment. John Deere has incurred and continues to incur substantial research and development costs related to the implementation of these more rigorous laws and regulations. While John Deere has developed and is executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements, these plans are subject to many variables that could delay or otherwise affect John Deere’s ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or\n20\nengines, which could negatively impact business results. Additionally, in certain locations governments have banned or may in the future ban internal combustion engines for some types of products completely. To the extent these bans affect products manufactured and sold by John Deere, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be negatively affected.\nGovernmental actions designed to address climate change and the emergence of new technologies and business models in connection with the transition to a lower-carbon economy could adversely affect John Deere and its customers. The physical effects attributed to climate change could further impact John Deere’s facilities, suppliers, and customers.\nThere is global scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations may lead to new international, national, regional, or local legislative or regulatory responses. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders, and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including John Deere, are continuing to look for ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources or the imposition of carbon pricing mechanisms could result in additional costs to John Deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances, facilities improvements, and energy costs, which would increase John Deere’s operating costs through higher utility, transportation, and materials costs. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also affect customer operations and demand for John Deere equipment. Because the impact of any future climate change-related legislative, regulatory, or product standard requirements on John Deere’s global businesses and products is dependent on the timing and design of mandates or standards, John Deere is unable to predict their potential impact at this time.\nCustomer preferences in the markets served by John Deere could change as these markets transition to less carbon-intensive business models. Demand for electric agricultural, turf, and construction equipment could rise. The development of alternative farming techniques, carbon sequestration technologies, and new low-carbon biofuels could change farmers’ business models and equipment needs. If John Deere fails to properly develop or invest in new technologies to meet changing customer demands, John Deere will be at risk of losing potential sources of revenue, which could affect the Company’s future financial results.\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change on John Deere’s facilities, suppliers, and customers and therefore on John Deere’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographic regions. These may include extreme weather events and long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability. These potential physical effects may adversely affect the demand for John Deere’s products and the cost, production, sales, and financial performance of John Deere’s operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nJohn Deere’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations, the violation of which could expose John Deere to potential liabilities, increased costs, and other adverse effects.\nJohn Deere’s global operations are subject to numerous international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, many of which are complex, frequently changing, and subject to varying interpretations. These laws and regulations cover a broad spectrum of subject areas, including advertising; anti–money laundering; antitrust; consumer finance; environmental, health, and safety, including proper handling of electronic waste, recycling, and climate change; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; foreign ownership and investment; import/export and trade; human rights, labor, and employment; product liability; and telematics and data privacy and connectivity. These laws may vary substantially within the different markets in which John Deere operates. Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and may further increase the cost of conducting John Deere’s global operations. In addition, John Deere must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and all applicable foreign anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage, regardless of whether those practices are legal or culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Although John Deere has a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that John Deere’s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or John Deere’s policies and procedures. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have a materially adverse effect on John Deere’s reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nChanges to existing laws and regulations or changes to how they are interpreted or the implementation of new, more stringent laws or regulations could adversely affect John Deere’s business by increasing compliance costs, limiting John Deere’s ability to offer a product or service, requiring changes to John Deere’s business practices, or otherwise making John Deere’s products and services less attractive to customers. For example, so-called “right to repair” legislation proposals in certain states and at the federal level in the U.S. could require John Deere to provide access to the software code embedded in its products, which, among other harmful consequences, could result in product safety issues, compromise engine emissions and performance controls, adversely affect the protection of John Deere’s intellectual property rights, and discourage innovation and investments in research and development.\n21\nLegislative and regulatory changes and other actions that could potentially affect John Deere’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and John Deere may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse effects from such measures.\nStrategic Performance Risks\nJohn Deere may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of its business strategies, including acquisitions, joint ventures, and divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nFrom time to time, John Deere makes strategic acquisitions and divestitures and participates in joint ventures. Acquisitions and joint ventures that John Deere has entered into, or may enter into in the future, may involve significant challenges and risks, including that the acquisitions or joint ventures do not advance John Deere’s business strategy or fail to produce satisfactory returns on investment. John Deere may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with its operations, applying internal control processes to these acquisitions, managing strategic investments, and assimilating new capabilities to meet the future needs of John Deere’s businesses. Integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management. Furthermore, John Deere may not realize all the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, or the realized benefits may be significantly delayed. While our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business, legal, and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, these due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential risks of a particular acquisition or joint venture, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s or joint venture partner’s previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition target's or joint venture’s products or services. John Deere may decide to divest acquired businesses if we determine any such divestiture is in the best interests of our shareholders, and our joint ventures may be terminated at or before their stated terms. Divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may involve significant challenges and risks, including failure to advance our business strategy, costs or disruptions to John Deere, and negative effects on John Deere’s product offerings, which may adversely affect John Deere’s business, results of operations, and financial condition. Divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may result in ongoing financial or legal involvement in the divested business through indemnifications or other financial arrangements, such as retained liabilities, which could affect the Company’s future financial results.\nIn addition, John Deere may not realize all anticipated benefits of its recent reorganization and the implementation of its operating model within the anticipated timeframe or at all. Factors that could affect these benefits include the adoption of new job types within John Deere, changing job responsibilities of employees, the number of layers of management, the ability of employees to embrace change, anxiety within the workforce, and temporary inefficiencies. Further, the ability of John Deere to execute its business strategies in production systems, precision technologies, and aftermarket support could affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nPrecision Technology Risks\nIf John Deere is unable to deliver precision technology and agricultural solutions to its customers, it could affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nJohn Deere’s approach to precision technology involves hardware and software, guidance, connectivity and digital solutions, automation and machine intelligence, and autonomy. To create and maintain a competitive differentiation through precision technology solutions, John Deere needs to successfully develop and introduce new precision technology solutions that improve profitability and sustainability for customers through the production systems. John Deere may make significant investments in research and development, acquisitions or other business ventures, data security for precision technology solutions, and employee training. These investments may not produce solutions that provide the desired results for customers’ profitability or sustainability outcomes. In addition, John Deere may depend on third parties to supply components, software, and services in support of precision technology solutions. The dealer channel’s ability to support and service precision technology solutions may affect customers’ acceptance and adoption rates of these products. Further, if John Deere is not able to deliver precision technology solutions with differentiated features and functionality, customers may not adopt technology solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputation and business.\nThe reallocation of radio frequency (RF) bands could disrupt or degrade the reliability of John Deere’s high precision augmented Global Positioning System (GPS) or other RF technology, which could impair John Deere’s ability to develop and market GPS- and RF-based technology solutions as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers’ profitability.\nJohn Deere’s current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems, as well as its fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment, depend upon the use of RF signals. These signals include, but are not limited to, GPS signals, other GPS-like satellite signals, augmented GPS services, and other RF technologies that link equipment, operations, owners, dealers, and technicians. These radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national government agencies. Any international or national reallocation of frequency bands, including frequency bands segmentation\n22\nand band spectrum sharing, or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands, could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of John Deere’s GPS-based products, which could negatively affect John Deere’s ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions. For John Deere’s agricultural customers, the inability to use high-precision augmented GPS signals or other RF signals could result in lower crop yields and higher equipment maintenance, seed, fertilizer, fuel, and wage costs. For construction customers, disrupting GPS or RF applications could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs, as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies. These cost increases could significantly reduce customers’ profitability and demand for John Deere products."

The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED\nOCTOBER 31, 2021, NOVEMBER 1, 2020, AND NOVEMBER 3, 2019\nOVERVIEW\nOrganization\nThe company’s equipment operations generate revenues and cash primarily from the sale of equipment to John Deere dealers and distributors. The equipment operations manufacture and distribute a full line of agricultural equipment; a variety of commercial and consumer equipment; and a broad range of equipment for construction, roadbuilding, and forestry. The company’s financial services primarily provide credit services, which mainly finance sales and leases of equipment by John Deere dealers and trade receivables purchased from the equipment operations. In addition, financial services offers extended equipment warranties. The information in the following discussion is presented in a format that includes information grouped as consolidated, equipment operations, and financial services. The equipment operations represents the enterprise without financial services. The equipment operations includes the company’s production and precision agriculture operations, small agriculture and turf operations, construction and forestry operations, and other corporate assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses not reflected within financial services. The company also views its operations as consisting of two geographic areas: the U.S. and Canada, and outside the U.S. and Canada. The company’s operating segments consist of production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, construction and forestry, and financial services.\nTrends and Economic Conditions\nThe company’s production and precision agriculture equipment and small agriculture and turf equipment sales both increased 27 percent in 2021. Industry sales of large agricultural machinery in the U.S. and Canada for 2022 are forecasted to increase approximately 15 percent compared to 2021. Industry sales of small agricultural and turf equipment in the U.S. and Canada are expected to be flat in 2022. Industry sales of agricultural machinery in Europe are estimated to be about 5 percent higher. South American industry sales of tractors and combines are expected to be roughly 5 percent higher in 2022. Asia industry sales are forecasted to be nearly the same in 2022 as in 2021. The company’s construction and forestry sales increased 27 percent in 2021. On an industry basis, North American construction equipment and compact construction equipment sales are both expected to be 5 to 10 percent higher in 2022. Global forestry industry sales are projected to increase 10 to 15 percent.\nThe company’s f\ninancial services operations for the full year 2022 are expected to experience slightly lower results due to a higher provision for credit losses,\nlower gains on operating lease residual values, and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. These factors are expected to be partially offset by income earned on a higher average portfolio.\nItems of concern that could affect the company’s results of operations and liquidity and capital resources include uncertainty of the effectiveness of governmental and private sector actions to address COVID, supply of critical parts and components, trade agreements, the uncertainty of the results of monetary and fiscal policies, the impact of elevated levels of sovereign and state debt, capital market disruptions, changes in demand and pricing for new and used equipment, geopolitical events, and the other items discussed in the “Safe Harbor Statement” below. Significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and volatility in the price of many commodities could also impact the company’s results. The future financial effects of COVID continue to be unknown due to many factors. As a result of these uncertainties, predicting the company’s forecasted financial performance is subject to many assumptions.\nThe UAW, the union representing the majority of the company’s production and maintenance employees in the U.S., initiated a strike on October 14, 2021. This resulted in a work stoppage affecting employees at 14 U.S. facilities. The work stoppage continued through the approval of a new six-year collective bargaining agreement on November 17, 2021. The company’s operations during the remainder of the fourth quarter were adversely affected by the work stoppage, which reduced production and shipments.\nThe company’s 2021 full-year performance reflects strong end-market demand and the ability of the company’s dedicated employees, dealers, and suppliers throughout the world, who have helped safely maintain operations, manage supply chain challenges, and continue to serve customers throughout the COVID pandemic. Demand for farm and construction equipment is expected to continue to benefit from positive fundamentals, including favorable crop prices, economic growth, and increased investment in infrastructure. While supply-chain pressures are expected to persist into at least the early part of fiscal year 2022, the company is working closely with key suppliers to secure the parts and components that customers need in order to deliver essential food and infrastructure more profitably and sustainably.\nCOVID Effects, Actions, and Recent Developments\nDuring 2020 and to a lesser extent in 2021, the effects of COVID and the related actions of governments and other authorities to contain COVID have affected and continue to affect the company’s operations, results, cash flows, and forecasts.\nThe U.S. government and many other governments in countries where the company operates have designated the company an essential critical infrastructure business. This designation allows the company to operate in support of its customers to the extent possible.\nThe company’s first priority in addressing the effects of COVID continues to be the health, safety, and overall welfare of its\n27\n​\nemployees. The company effectively activated previously established business continuity plans and proactively implemented health and safety measures at its operations around the world.\nThe company broadened its supply base to minimize the impact of potential supply chain disruptions on its ability to meet customer demand. The company has experienced shortages of critical parts and components, which caused challenges and production disruptions. The company continues to monitor the situation and work closely with suppliers.\nThe company continued to work closely with customers in 2021 in connection with short-term payment relief on obligations owed to the company. Financing receivables and operating leases granted relief since the beginning of the pandemic that remained outstanding at October 31, 2021 represented about 3 percent and about 2 percent of the respective portfolio balances. The trade receivables granted relief that remained outstanding at October 31, 2021 were not material. Additional information is presented in Notes 13 and 25.\n2021 COMPARED WITH 2020\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\n​\n​\nNet income in 2020 was negatively affected by impairment charges and employee-separation costs of $458 million after-tax (see Notes 4 and 5). In addition, net income in 2020 was less favorably affected by discrete adjustments to the provision for income taxes.\n​\n​\nThe discussion on net sales and operating profit is included in the Business Segment and Geographic Area Results below.\nA discussion of the cost of sales to net sales ratio and other significant statement of consolidated income changes follows:\n​\n​\nThe cost of sales to net sales ratio decreased compared to 2020 mainly due to price realization and the impact of impairments and employee-separation expenses recorded in 2020 (see Note 5). Finance and interest income reduced slightly in 2021 due to lower average interest rates, largely offset by a higher average credit portfolio. Other income increased primarily due to operating lease disposition gains. Research and development expenses were lower in 2021 largely due to employee-separation expenses incurred in 2020 (see Note 5) and organizational efficiencies. Selling, administrative and general expenses decreased mostly due to employee-separation expenses recorded in 2020 (see Note 5) and a lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher incentive compensation. Interest expense decreased in 2021 due to lower average borrowing rates. Other operating expenses were lower compared to 2020 largely due to lower retirement benefit costs, reduced depreciation of equipment on operating leases, and the impact of operating lease impairments recorded in 2020 (see Note 5).\nThe company has several funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans, primarily health care and life insurance plans. The company’s costs for these plans in 2021 were $197 million, compared with $341 million in 2020. The long-term expected return on plan assets, which is reflected in these costs, was an expected gain of 5.9 percent in 2021 and 6.4 percent in 2020, or $876 million and $869 million, respectively. The actual return was a gain of $3,616 million in 2021 and $1,177 million in 2020. In 2022, the expected return is approximately 5.0 percent. The company’s costs under these plans in 2022, including the pension expense related to the UAW contract ratification and the expected gain on the voluntary OPEB contribution (see Note 29), are expected to be consistent with 2021. See the discussion in “Critical Accounting Estimates” for more information about pension and OPEB benefit obligations.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS\nThe following discussion relates to operating results by reportable segment and geographic area. Operating profit is income before corporate expenses, certain external interest expense, certain foreign exchange gains or losses, and income taxes. However, the financial services segment operating profit includes the effect of interest expense and foreign currency exchange gains or losses.\n28\n​\nIn fiscal year 2021, the company implemented a new operating model and reporting structure. With this change, the company’s agriculture and turf operations were divided into two new segments: production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf.\nThe production and precision agriculture segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for production-scale growers of large grains, small grains, cotton, and sugar. Main products include large and certain mid-size tractors, combines, cotton pickers, sugarcane harvesters and loaders, and soil preparation, seeding, application and crop care equipment.\nThe small agriculture and turf segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for dairy and livestock producers, high-value crop producers, and turf and utility customers. The segment’s primary products include certain mid-size and small tractors, as well as hay and forage equipment, riding and commercial lawn equipment, golf course equipment, and utility vehicles.\nThere were no reporting changes for the construction and forestry and financial services segments. As a result, the company has four reportable segments.\nWorldwide Production and Precision Agriculture Operations\n​\n​\nSegment sales increased due to higher shipment volumes and price realization. Operating profit benefitted from price realization, higher shipment volumes / sales mix, and a favorable indirect tax ruling in Brazil. These items were partially offset by higher production costs. The prior year was also impacted by employee-separation program expenses (see Note 5).\nWorldwide Small Agriculture and Turf Operations\n​\n​\nSegment sales and operating profit were both higher in 2021 due to higher shipment volumes / sales mix and price realization. The operating profit improvement was partially offset by higher production costs. Results for the current year were positively impacted by a gain on the sale of a factory in China, while results for the prior year were affected by impairments, closure costs, and employee-separation expenses (see Note 5).\nWorldwide Construction and Forestry Operations\n​\n​\nSegment sales increased in 2021 primarily due to higher shipment volumes and price realization. Operating profit increased mainly due to positive shipment volumes / sales mix and price realization, partially offset by higher production costs. The prior year was also impacted by employee-separation program expenses and impairments in certain fixed assets and unconsolidated affiliates (see Note 5).\n​\n29\n​\nWorldwide Financial Services Operations\n​\n​\nWhile the average balance of receivables and leases financed was 5 percent higher in 2021, revenue decreased due to lower average interest rates. Interest expense decreased in 2021 as a result of lower average borrowing rates. Net income in 2021 increased mainly due to an improvement on operating lease residual values, a lower provision for credit losses, more favorable financing spreads, and income earned on a higher average portfolio.\nDeere & Company in U.S. and Canada\n​\n​\nNet sales and revenues increased in 2021 due mostly to higher shipment volumes / sales mix and price realization. The growth in operating profit was due primarily to increased shipment volumes / sales mix and price realization, partially offset by higher production costs. Results in 2020 were negatively impacted by impairment charges and employee-separation expenses.\nDeere & Company outside U.S. and Canada\n​\n​\nThe net sales and revenue increase in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily the result of higher shipment volumes / sales mix, price realization, and the favorable effects of currency translation. Operating profit improvement was largely due to higher shipment volumes / sales mix and price realization, partially offset by increased production costs. Results in 2020 were negatively impacted by impairment charges and employee-separation costs.\n2020 COMPARED WITH 2019\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\n​\n​\nNet income in 2020 was negatively affected by impairment charges and employee-separation costs of $458 million after-tax (see Notes 4 and 5). In 2019, the similar charges were $82 million. In addition, the provision for income taxes was adversely affected by non-deductible impairments and charges in 2020 and less favorably affected by discrete adjustments in 2020 than in 2019.\n​\n​\nThe discussion of net sales and operating profit is included in the following Business Segment and Geographic Area Results. The equipment operations’ provision for income taxes and net income were adversely affected by non-deductible impairments and charges in 2020 and were less favorably affected by discrete adjustments to the provision for income taxes in 2020 than in 2019.\nA discussion of the cost of sales to net sales ratio and other significant statement of consolidated income changes follows:\n​\n​\nThe cost of sales to net sales ratio decreased compared to 2019 mainly due to price realization, improved production costs, and lower warranty expenses, partially offset by impairments, employee-separation expenses (see Note 5), and the unfavorable\n30\n​\neffects of foreign currency exchange. Finance and interest income decreased slightly in 2020 due to lower average interest rates, largely offset by a higher average credit portfolio. Other income declined primarily due to lower service income compared to 2019. Research and development expenses decreased compared to 2019 as a result of targeted project reductions related to COVID spending adjustments. Selling, administrative and general expenses decreased largely due to spending reductions and the favorable effects of currency translation, mostly offset by employee-separation expenses (see Note 5) and an increase in the provision for credit losses. Interest expense decreased in 2020 due to lower average borrowing rates, partially offset by higher average borrowings. Other operating expenses increased compared to 2019 largely due to increased depreciation of equipment on operating leases, employee-separation expenses (see Note 5), and a loss on sale of a business (see Note 4). These items were mostly offset by lower impairments and reduced losses on operating lease residual values and reduced service related expenses.\nThe company has several funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plans, primarily health care and life insurance plans. The company’s costs for these plans in 2020 were $341 million, compared with $235 million in 2019. The returns on plan assets were gains of $1,177 million in 2020 and $2,163 million in 2019. Total company contributions to the plans were $951 million in 2020 and $518 million in 2019, which included voluntary contributions and direct benefit payments. The voluntary contributions to plan assets were $700 million in 2020 to a U.S. OPEB plan, and $306 million in 2019, which included $300 million to the same U.S. OPEB plan.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA RESULTS\nWorldwide Production and Precision Agriculture Operations\n​\n​\nSegment sales decreased due to lower shipment volumes and the unfavorable effects of currency translation, partially offset by price realization. Operating profit increased largely due to price realization, lower research and development expense, reduced selling, administrative and general expenses, and lower warranty expenses. These items were partially offset by lower shipment volumes / mix, the unfavorable effects of currency exchange, and employee-separation expenses.\nWorldwide Small Agriculture and Turf Operations\n​\n​\nSegment sales decreased due to lower shipment volumes, partially offset by price realization. Operating profit improved due to price realization, favorable production costs, lower selling,\nadministrative and general expenses, reduced research and development expense, and lower warranty expense, partially offset by lower shipment volumes / mix, employee-separation expenses and impairments.\nWorldwide Construction and Forestry Operations\n​\n​\nSegment sales decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower shipment volumes and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by price realization. Operating profit declined mainly due to lower shipment volumes / mix, employee-separation expenses, impairments, and the unfavorable effects of currency exchange. The reduction in operating profit was partially offset by price realization, lower research and development expenses, reduced selling, administrative and general expenses, and improved production costs.\nWorldwide Financial Services Operations\n​\n​\nWhile the average balance of receivables and leases financed was 2 percent higher in 2020, revenue decreased due to lower average interest rates. Interest expense decreased in 2020 as a result of lower average borrowing rates, partially offset by higher average borrowings. Net income in 2020 increased mainly due to lower impairments and reduced losses on operating lease residual values and income earned on a higher average portfolio, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses, employee-separation expenses, and unfavorable financing spreads.\nDeere & Company in U.S. and Canada\n​\n​\nNet sales and revenues decreased in 2020 due primarily to lower shipment volumes, partially offset by price realization. The reduction in operating profit was due primarily to lower shipment volumes / mix and employee-separation expenses, partially offset by price realization, lower research and development costs, reduced selling, general and administrative expenses, improved production costs, and lower warranty expenses.\nDeere & Company outside U.S. and Canada\n​\n​\nThe net sales and revenues decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily the result of lower shipment volumes and the\n31\n​\nunfavorable effects of currency translation, partially offset by price realization. Operating profit declined primarily due to lower shipment volumes / mix, impairments, employee-separation expenses, and the unfavorable effects of currency exchange, largely offset by price realization, reduced selling, general and administrative expenses, lower research and development costs, improved production costs, and lower warranty expenses.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nThe discussion of capital resources and liquidity has been organized to review separately, where appropriate, the company’s consolidated totals, equipment operations, and financial services operations.\nCONSOLIDATED\nPositive cash flows from consolidated operating activities in 2021 were $7,726 million. This resulted primarily from net income adjusted for non-cash provisions, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and a decrease in receivables related to sales, which were partially offset by an increase in inventories. Cash outflows from investing activities were $5,750 million in 2021, due mainly to the cost of receivables (excluding receivables related to sales) and cost of equipment on operating leases acquired exceeding the collections of receivables and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $4,332 million, purchases of property and equipment of $848 million, a change in collateral on derivatives – net of $281 million, and acquisition of businesses, net of cash acquired, of $244 million (see Note 4). Cash outflows from financing activities were $1,078 million in 2021, due primarily to repurchases of common stock of $2,538 million and dividends paid of $1,040 million, partially offset by an increase in borrowings of $2,450 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock (resulting from the exercise of stock options) of $148 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased $953 million during 2021.\nOver the last three years, operating activities have provided an aggregate of\n$18,621 million in cash. Cash inflows were also provided by increases in borrowings of $5,621 million. The aggregate amount of these cash inflows was used mainly to acquire receivables (excluding receivables related to sales) and equipment on operating leases that exceeded collections of receivables and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $9,817 million, repurchase common stock of $4,541 million, pay dividends of $2,939 million, and purchase property and equipment of $2,788 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased $4,110 million\nover the three-year period.\nThe company has access to most global capital markets at reasonable costs and expects to have sufficient sources of global funding and liquidity to meet its funding needs in the short term and long term. Sources of liquidity for the company include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds from operations, the issuance of commercial paper and term debt, the securitization of retail notes (both public and private markets), and committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit. The company’s commercial paper outstanding at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 was $2,230 million and $1,238 million, respectively, while the\ntotal cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities position was $8,745 million and $7,707 million, respectively. The amount of the total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $5,817 million at October 31, 2021 and $5,010 million at November 1, 2020. During November 2021, the company’s foreign subsidiaries returned $3,500 million of cash and cash equivalents to the U.S.\nLines of Credit.\nThe company also has access to bank lines of credit with various banks throughout the world. Worldwide lines of credit totaled $8,336 million at October 31, 2021, $5,770 million of which were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings, excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term borrowings, were considered to constitute utilization. Included in the total credit lines at October 31, 2021 was a 364-day credit facility agreement of $3,000 million, expiring in fiscal April 2022. In addition, total credit lines included long-term credit facility agreements of $2,500 million, expiring in fiscal April 2025, and $2,500 million, expiring in fiscal March 2026. The agreements are mutually extendable and the annual facility fees are not significant. These credit agreements require John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation) to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than 1.05 to 1 for each fiscal quarter and the ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholder’s equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than 11 to 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter. The credit agreements also require the equipment operations to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capital (total debt and stockholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) of 65 percent or less at the end of each fiscal quarter. Under this provision, the company’s excess equity capacity and retained earnings balance free of restriction at October 31, 2021 was $15,388 million. Alternatively under this provision, the equipment operations had the capacity to incur additional debt of $28,579 million at October 31, 2021. All of these credit agreement requirements have been met during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.\nDebt Ratings.\nTo access public debt capital markets, the company relies on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to the company’s securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A security rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell, or hold company securities. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw company ratings based on its assessment of the company’s current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, and reduced access to debt capital markets.\n32\n​\nThe senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to unsecured company securities by the rating agencies engaged by the company are as follows:\n​\n​\nTrade Accounts and Notes Receivable.\nTrade accounts and notes receivable primarily arise from sales of goods to independent dealers. Trade receivables increased by $37 million in 2021. The ratio of trade accounts and notes receivable at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 to fiscal year net sales was 11 and 13 percent, respectively. Total worldwide production and precision agriculture receivables decreased $193 million, worldwide small agriculture and turf receivables increased $199 million, and construction and forestry receivables increased $31 million. The collection period for trade receivables averages less than 12 months. The percentage of trade receivables outstanding for a period exceeding 12 months\nwas 1 percent at October 31, 2021 and 3 percent at November 1, 2020.\nDeere & Company Stockholders’ Equity\n. Deere & Company stockholders’ equity was $18,431 million at October 31, 2021, compared with $12,937 million at November 1, 2020. The increase of $5,494 million resulted from net income attributable to Deere & Company of $5,963 million, a change in the retirement benefits adjustment of $2,884 million, an increase in common stock of $159 million, and a change in the cumulative translation adjustment of $118 million, which was partially offset by an increase in treasury stock of $2,468 million and dividends declared of $1,125 million.\nContractual Obligations and Cash Requirements.\nThe company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations:\nBorrowings\n– As of October 31, 2021, the equipment operations had $1,497 million of payments due on borrowings and securitization borrowings in the next year, along with interest payments of $329 million. As of the same date, the financial services operations had $11,959 million of payments due on borrowings and securitization borrowings in the next year, along with interest payments of $574 million. The securitization borrowing payments are based on the expected liquidation of the retail notes, as well as the repurchases due to the reduced facility capacity (see Note 29). The financial services borrowings will likely be replaced with new borrowings to finance their receivable and lease portfolios.\nPurchase Obligations\n– As of October 31, 2021, the company’s outstanding purchase obligations were $4,314 million, with $4,190 million payable within one year. These purchase obligations are noncancelable.\nOther Cash Requirements\n–\nIn addition to its contractual obligations, the company’s quarterly cash dividend is $1.05 per share, subject to change at the discretion of the company’s Board of Directors. Total company pension and OPEB contributions in 2022 are expected to be approximately $1,250 million. Fiscal year\n2022 contributions include a voluntary U.S. OPEB plan contribution of $1,000 million made on November 30, 2021 (see Note 29). Also anticipated in 2022 is the dissolution of the joint venture agreement between the company and Hitachi. In connection with the termination, the company will purchase all of Hitachi’s shares in the relevant joint venture manufacturing entities and receive certain intellectual property rights. The initial cash consideration consists of $275 million for the shares and an intellectual property license (see Notes 1, 4, and 11). The company will consider share repurchases as a means of deploying excess cash to shareholders once the previously mentioned requirements are met.\nEQUIPMENT OPERATIONS\nThe company’s equipment businesses are capital intensive and are subject to seasonal variations in financing requirements for inventories and certain receivables from dealers. The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to financial services. To the extent necessary, funds provided from operations are supplemented by external financing sources.\nCash provided by operating activities of the equipment operations during 2021, including intercompany cash flows, was\n$5,900 million due largely to net income adjusted for non-cash provisions and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by an increase in inventories and an increase in trade, notes, and\nfinancing receivables related to sales.\nOver the last three years, these operating activities, including intercompany cash flows, have provided an aggregate of $13,860 million in cash.\nTrade receivables held by the equipment operations increased by $142 million during 2021. The equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to financial services (see previous consolidated discussion).\nInventories increased by $1,782 million in 2021 due primarily to increased production schedules. A majority of these inventories are valued on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The ratios of inventories on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis (see Note 15), which approximates current cost, to fiscal year cost of sales were 31 percent and 28 percent at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively.\nTotal interest-bearing debt, excluding finance lease liabilities, of the equipment operations was $10,373 million at the end of 2021, compared with $10,382 million at the end of 2020 and $6,446 million at the end of 2019. The ratio of total debt to total capital (total interest-bearing debt and Deere & Company stockholders’ equity) at the end of 2021, 2020, and 2019 was 36 percent, 45 percent, and 36 percent, respectively.\nIn 2020, the equipment operations issued three tranches of notes in the U.S. with aggregate principal totaling $2,250 million that are due from 2025 to 2050. The equipment operations also issued Euro notes with aggregate principal totaling €2,000 million (approximately $2,170 million based on the exchange rate at the issue date) that are due from 2024 to 2032 (see Note 20). In 2020, the equipment operations issued commercial paper in the U.S. with aggregate\n33\n​\nprincipal totaling $466 million, of which $448 million had an original term greater than 90 days. This commercial paper was repaid in 2020 and is presented in “Increase (decrease) in total short-term borrowings” in the statement of consolidated cash flows.\nProperty and equipment cash expenditures for the equipment operations in 2021 were $845 million, compared with $816 million in 2020. Capital expenditures in 2022 are estimated to be $1,175 million.\nFINANCIAL SERVICES\nThe financial services operations rely on their ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance their receivable and lease portfolios. Their primary sources of funds for this purpose are a combination of commercial paper, term debt, securitization of retail notes, equity capital, and borrowings from Deere & Company.\nThe cash provided by operating and financing activities was used primarily to increase receivables and leases. Cash flows from the financial services’ operating activities, including intercompany cash flows, were\n$1,965 million in 2021. Cash used for investing activities totaled $4,308 million in 2021 due primarily to the cost of receivables (excluding trade and wholesale) and cost of equipment on operating leases acquired exceeding collections of these receivables and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases by $5,311 million, a change in collateral on derivatives – net of $274 million, and purchases of marketable securities exceeding proceeds from maturities and sales by $89 million. Partially offsetting the use of cash was a decrease in trade receivables and wholesale notes of $1,364 million. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $2,238 million in 2021, resulting primarily from an increase in external borrowings of $2,468 million, an increase in borrowings from Deere & Company of $354 million, partially offset by dividends paid to Deere & Company of $555 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased $91\nmillion.\nOver the last three years, the operating activities, including intercompany cash flows, have provided\n$6,359 million in cash. In addition, an increase in total borrowings of $5,476 million, a decrease in trade and wholesale receivables of $2,428 million, and a change in collateral on derivatives – net of $59 million provided cash inflows. These amounts have been used mainly to fund receivables (excluding trade and wholesale) and equipment on operating lease acquisitions, which exceeded collections and the proceeds from sales of equipment on operating leases, by $12,454 million, pay dividends to Deere & Company of $1,368 million, and purchase $182 million of marketable securities in excess of maturities and sales. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased $112\nmillion over the three-year period.\nTrade and financing receivables and equipment on operating leases increased\nby $3,401 million in 2021, compared with 2020. Total acquisition volumes of receivables (excluding trade and wholesale) and cost of equipment on operating leases increased 16 percent in 2021, compared with 2020. The volume of finance leases, retail notes, and revolving charge accounts increased\n33 percent, 26 percent, and 1 percent, respectively. The volume of operating leases decreased 2 percent\n. During 2021, the wholesale notes and\ntrade receivables portfolios decreased 26 percent and 7 percent, respectively.\nTotal external interest-bearing debt of the financial services operations was $37,978 million at the end of 2021, compared with $35,556 million at the end of 2020 and $38,888 million at the end of 2019. Total external borrowings have changed generally corresponding with the level of the receivable and lease portfolio, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in payables owed to Deere & Company, and the change in investment from Deere & Company. The financial services operations’ ratio of total interest-bearing debt to total stockholder’s equity was 7.8 to 1 at the end of 2021, 7.8 to 1 at the end of 2020, and 8.0 to 1 at the end of 2019.\nThe Capital Corporation has a revolving credit agreement to utilize bank conduit facilities to securitize retail notes (see Note 14). At October 31, 2021, the revolving credit agreement had a total capacity, or “financing limit,” of up to $2,000 million of secured financings at any time. At October 31, 2021, $1,572 million of short-term securitization borrowings were outstanding under the agreement. At the end of the contractual revolving period, unless the banks and Capital Corporation agree to renew, Capital Corporation would liquidate the secured borrowings over time as payments on the retail notes are collected.\nThe agreement was renewed in November 2021 with an expiration in November 2022 and a capacity of $1,000 million. As a result of the reduced capacity, $511 million of outstanding short-term securitization borrowings were repurchased by the company in November 2021, in addition to the normal monthly collection of payments on the retail notes.\nDuring 2021, the financial services operations issued $2,801 million and retired $2,861 million of retail note securitization borrowings, which are presented in “Increase (decrease) in total short-term borrowings” on the statement of consolidated cash flows. The financial services operations also issued $8,711 million and retired $6,996 million of long-term borrowings in 2021, which were primarily medium-term notes.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on the financial statements. The accounting policies below are those management believes are the most critical to the preparation of the company’s financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. The company’s other accounting policies are described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSales Incentives\nIn certain markets, the company provides sales incentives to dealers. At the time a sale to a dealer is recognized, the company records an estimate of the future sales incentive costs as a reduction to the sales price. These incentives may be based on a\n34\n​\ndealer’s purchase volume, or on retail sales incentive programs for allowances and financing programs that will be due when the dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. The estimated cost of these programs is based on historical data, announced and expected incentive programs, field inventory levels, and forecasted sales volumes. The final cost of these programs is determined at the end of the measurement period for volume-based incentives or when the dealer sells the equipment to the retail customer. This is due to numerous programs available at any particular time and new programs that may be announced after the company records the equipment sale. Changes in the mix and types of programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly.\nThe sales incentive accruals at October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019 were $1,680 million, $1,718 million, and $2,033 million, respectively. The total accruals recorded were $880 million, $1,109 million, and $1,443 million in trade accounts and notes receivable – net, and $800 million, $609 million, and $590 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses at October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019, respectively. The decrease in 2021\nprimarily resulted from higher retail demand and the decrease in 2020 primarily related to lower sales volume.\nThe estimation of the retail sales incentive accrual is impacted by many assumptions. One of the key assumptions is the predictive value of the historical percent of retail sales incentive costs to retail sales from dealers. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average of approximately plus or minus .5 percent, compared to the average retail sales incentive costs to retail sales percent during that period. Holding other assumptions constant, if this estimated retail incentive cost experience percent were to increase or decrease .5 percent, the sales incentive accrual at October 31, 2021 would increase or decrease by approximately $31 million.\nProduct Warranties\nFor most equipment and parts sales, the company provides a standard warranty to provide assurance that the equipment will function as intended for a specified period of time. At the time a sale is recognized, the company records the estimated future warranty costs. The company generally determines its total warranty liability by applying historical claims rate experience to the estimated amount of equipment that has been sold and is still under warranty based on dealer inventories and retail sales. The historical claims rate is primarily determined by a review of five-year claims costs and consideration of current quality developments. Variances in claims experience and the type of warranty programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly.\nThe product warranty accruals, excluding extended warranty unamortized premiums, at October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019 were $1,312 million, $1,105 million, and $1,218 million, respectively. The increase in 2021 primarily related to higher sales volume while the decrease in 2020 mainly related to lower sales volume.\nEstimates used to determine the product warranty accruals are significantly affected by the historical percent of warranty claims\ncosts to sales. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average of approximately plus or minus .08 percent, compared to the average warranty costs to sales percent during that period. Holding other assumptions constant, if this estimated cost experience percent were to increase or decrease .08 percent, the warranty accrual at October 31, 2021 would increase or decrease by approximately $35 million.\nPostretirement Benefit Obligations\nPension and OPEB, primarily health care and life insurance plans, obligations are based on various assumptions used by the company’s actuaries in calculating these amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, retirement rates, mortality rates, and other factors. Actual results that differ from the assumptions and changes in assumptions affect future expenses and obligations.\nThe pension assets, net of pension liabilities, recognized on the balance sheet at October 31, 2021 were $2,665 million. The pension liabilities, net of pension assets, recognized on the balance sheet at November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019 were $447 million and $226 million, respectively. The increase in the pension net assets in 2021 was primarily due to returns on plan assets. The increase in the pension net liabilities in 2020 was primarily due to decreases in discount rates and interest on the liabilities, largely offset by the return on plan assets.\nThe OPEB liabilities, net of OPEB assets, at October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019 were $3,175 million, $3,892 million, and $4,686 million, respectively. The decrease in OPEB net liabilities in 2021 was due primarily to returns on plan assets and favorable changes to medical assumptions. The decrease in OPEB net liabilities in 2020 was due primarily to contributions to a U.S. OPEB plan.\nThe effect of hypothetical changes to selected assumptions on the company’s major U.S. retirement benefit plans would be as follows in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment annually and when events or circumstances change such that it is more\n35\n​\nlikely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is reduced below its carrying amount. The end of the fiscal third quarter is the annual measurement date. To test for goodwill impairment, the carrying value of each reporting unit is compared with its fair value. If the carrying value of the goodwill is considered impaired, a loss is measured as the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over the fair value, with a limit of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nAn estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit is determined through a combination of comparable market values for similar businesses and discounted cash flows. These estimates can change significantly based on such factors as the reporting unit’s financial performance, economic conditions, interest rates, growth rates, pricing, changes in business strategies, and competition.\nThe company has not identified a reporting unit for which the goodwill was impaired in 2021, 2020, or 2019. For all reporting units, a 10 percent decrease in the estimated fair value would have had no effect on the carrying value of goodwill at the annual measurement date in 2021.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of the receivable portfolio. The allowance is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Risk characteristics considered by the company include finance product category, market, geography, credit risk, and remaining duration. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics with other receivables in the portfolio are evaluated on an individual basis. Non-performing receivables are included in the estimate of expected credit losses.\nThe company utilizes loss forecast models, which are selected based on the size and credit risk of the underlying pool of receivables, to estimate expected credit losses. Transition matrix models are used for large and complex retail customer receivable pools, while weighted average remaining maturity models are used for smaller and less complex retail customer receivable pools. Expected credit losses on wholesale receivables are based on historical loss rates, with consideration of current economic conditions and dealer financial risk. The modeled expected credit losses are adjusted based on reasonable and supportable forecasts, which may include economic indicators such as commodity prices, industry equipment sales, unemployment rates, and housing starts. Management reviews each model’s output quarterly, and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary.\nIn 2021, the company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, which revised the measurement of credit losses from an incurred loss to an expected loss methodology. Upon adoption the company’s allowance for credit losses increased with an offset to retained earnings (see Note 3). The allowance for credit losses at November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019 were not restated under the expected loss methodology. The total allowance for credit losses at October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019 was $207 million, $223 million, and $222 million, respectively. The allowance decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to lower expected losses\nin the construction and forestry market, continued improvement in the agriculture and turf market, and better than expected performance of accounts granted payment relief due to the economic effects of COVID. As previously mentioned, the allowance decrease was partially offset by the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13. The allowance was about the same in 2020 compared to 2019 with an increase in the financing receivable allowance largely offset by a decrease in the allowance for trade accounts and notes receivable (see Note 13).\nThe assumptions used in evaluating the company’s exposure to credit losses involve estimates and significant judgment. While the company believes its allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of its existing receivable portfolio, different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses. Historically, changes in economic conditions have had limited impact on credit losses within the company’s wholesale receivable portfolio. Within the retail customer receivables portfolio, credit loss estimates are dependent on a number of factors, including historical portfolio performance, current delinquency levels, and estimated recoveries on defaulted accounts. The company’s transition matrix models, which are utilized to estimate credit losses for more than 90 percent of retail customer receivables, use historical portfolio performance and current delinquency levels to forecast future defaults. Estimated recovery rates are applied to the estimated default balance to calculate the expected credit losses. Holding all other factors constant, a 10 percent increase in the transition matrix models’ forecasted defaults and a simultaneous 10 percent decrease in recovery rates would have resulted in a $34 million increase to the allowance for credit losses at October 31, 2021.\nOperating Lease Residual Values\nThe carrying value of equipment on operating leases is affected by the estimated fair values of the equipment at the end of the lease (residual values). Upon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third party, in which case the company may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale price. The estimated residual values are based on several factors, including lease term, expected hours of usage, historical wholesale sales prices, return experience, intended equipment use, market dynamics and trends, and dealer residual value guarantees. The company reviews residual value estimates during the lease term and tests the carrying value of its operating leases for impairment when events or circumstances necessitate. Changes in residual value assumptions would affect the amount of depreciation expense and the amount of investment in equipment on operating leases. Depreciation is adjusted prospectively on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term if residual estimates are revised.\nThe total operating lease residual values at\nOctober 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019 were $5,025 million, $5,254 million, and $5,259 million, respectively. The decreases in 2021 and 2020 primarily related to a lower average operating lease portfolio.\n36\n​\nEstimates used in determining end of lease market values for equipment on operating leases significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense. Hypothetically, if future market values for this equipment were to decrease 10 percent from the company’s present estimates and all the equipment on operating leases were returned to the company for remarketing at the end of the lease term, the total effect would be to increase the company’s annual depreciation for equipment on operating leases by approximately $80 million, after consideration of dealer residual value guarantees.\nIncome Taxes\nThe company’s income tax provision, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for uncertain tax benefits represent the company’s best estimate of current and future income taxes to be paid. The annual tax rate is based on income tax laws, statutory tax rates, taxable income levels, and tax planning opportunities available in various jurisdictions where the company operates. These tax laws are complex, and require significant judgment to determine the consolidated provision for income taxes. Changes in tax laws, regulations, statutory tax rates, and estimates of the company’s future taxable income levels could result in actual realization of deferred taxes being materially different from amounts provided for in the consolidated financial statements.\nDeferred income taxes represent temporary differences between the tax and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. Deferred tax assets also include loss carryforwards and tax credits. These assets are regularly assessed for the likelihood of recoverability from estimated future taxable income, reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and tax planning strategies. To the extent the company determines that it is more likely than not a deferred income tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established. The recoverability analysis of the deferred income tax assets and the related valuation allowances requires significant judgment and relies on estimates.\nUncertain tax positions are determined based on whether it is more likely than not the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position. For those positions that meet the more likely than not criteria, an estimate of the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority is recognized. The ultimate resolution of the tax position could take many years and result in a payment that is significantly different from the original estimate.\nA provision for foreign withholding taxes has not been recorded on undistributed profits of the company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries that are determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. If management intentions change in the future, there may be a significant impact on the provision for income taxes in the period the change occurs. For further information on income taxes, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.\nSAFE HARBOR STATEMENT\nSafe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:\nStatements under “Business” (including under\n“Market Conditions”), “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” (including under “Overview” and “Trends and Economic Conditions”), and other forward-looking statements herein that relate to future events, expectations, and trends involve factors that are subject to change, and risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all of the company’s businesses.\nThe company’s agricultural equipment businesses are subject to a number of uncertainties, including certain factors that affect farmers’ confidence and financial condition. These factors include demand for agricultural products; world grain stocks; weather conditions and the effects of climate change; soil conditions; harvest yields; prices for commodities and livestock; crop and livestock production expenses; availability of transport for crops (including as a result of reduced state and local transportation budgets); trade restrictions and tariffs (e.g., China); global trade agreements; the level of farm product exports (including concerns about genetically modified organisms); the growth and sustainability of non-food uses for some crops (including ethanol and biodiesel production); real estate values; available acreage for farming; land ownership policies of governments; changes in government farm programs and policies; international reaction to such programs; changes in and effects of crop insurance programs; changes in environmental regulations and their impact on farming practices; animal diseases (e.g., African swine fever\n) and their effects on poultry, beef, and pork consumption and prices and on livestock feed demand; crop pests and diseases; and the impact of the COVID pandemic on the agricultural industry including demand for, and production and exports of, agricultural products, and commodity prices.\nThe production and precision agriculture business is dependent on agricultural conditions, and relies in part on hardware and software, guidance, connectivity and digital solutions, and automation and machine intelligence. Many factors contribute to the company’s precision agriculture sales and results, including the impact to customers’ profitability and/or sustainability outcomes; the rate of adoption and use by customers; availability of technological innovations; speed of research and development; effectiveness of partnerships with third parties; and the dealer channel’s ability to support and service precision technology solutions.\nFactors affecting the company’s small agriculture and turf equipment operations include agricultural conditions; consumer confidence; weather conditions and the effects of climate change; customer profitability; labor supply; consumer borrowing patterns; consumer purchasing preferences; housing starts and supply; infrastructure investment; spending by municipalities and golf courses; and consumable input costs.\nFactors affecting the company’s construction and forestry equipment operations include consumer spending patterns; real estate and housing prices; the number of housing starts; interest\n37\n​\nrates; commodity prices such as oil and gas; the levels of public and non-residential construction; and investment in infrastructure. Prices for pulp, paper, lumber, and structural panels affect sales of forestry equipment.\nMany of the factors affecting the production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry segments have been and may continue to be impacted by global economic conditions, including those resulting from the COVID pandemic and responses to the pandemic taken by governments and other authorities.\nAll of the company’s businesses and its results are affected by general economic conditions in the global markets and industries in which the company operates; customer confidence in general economic conditions; government spending and taxing; foreign currency exchange rates and their volatility, especially fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar; interest rates (including the availability of IBOR reference rates); inflation and deflation rates; changes in weather and climate patterns; the political and social stability of the global markets in which the company operates; the effects of, or response to, terrorism and security threats; wars and other conflicts; natural disasters; and the spread of major epidemics or pandemics (including the COVID pandemic) and government and industry responses to such epidemics or pandemics, such as travel restrictions and extended shut downs of businesses.\nContinued uncertainties related to the magnitude, duration, and persistent effects of the COVID pandemic may significantly adversely affect the company’s business and outlook. These uncertainties include, among other things: the duration and impact of the resurgence in COVID cases in any country, state, or region; the emergence, contagiousness, and threat of new and different strains of virus; the availability, acceptance, and effectiveness of vaccines; additional closures as mandated or otherwise made necessary by governmental authorities; disruptions in the supply chain, including those caused by industry capacity constraints, material availability, and global logistics delays and constraints arising from, among other things, the transportation capacity of ocean shipping containers, and a prolonged delay in resumption of operations by one or more key suppliers, or the failure of any key suppliers;\nan increasingly competitive labor market due to a sustained labor shortage or increased turnover caused by the COVID pandemic;\nthe company’s ability to meet commitments to customers on a timely basis as a result of increased costs and supply and transportation challenges; increased logistics costs; additional operating costs due to continued remote working arrangements, adherence to social distancing guidelines, and\nother COVID\n-\nrelated challenges; increased risk of cyberattacks on network connections used in remote working arrangements; increased privacy-related risks due to processing health-related personal information; legal claims related to personal protective equipment designed, made, or provided by the company or alleged exposure to COVID on company premises; absence of employees due to illness; and the impact of the pandemic on the\ncompany’s customers and dealers. The sustainability of the economic recovery observed in 2021 remains unclear and significant volatility could continue for a prolonged period. These factors, and others that are currently unknown or considered immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial position\n.\nSignificant changes in market liquidity conditions, changes in the company’s credit ratings, and any failure to comply with financial covenants in credit agreements could impact access to funding and funding costs, which could reduce the company’s earnings and cash flows. Financial market conditions could also negatively impact customer access to capital for purchases of the company’s products and customer confidence and purchase decisions, financing and repayment practices, and the number and size of customer delinquencies and defaults. A debt crisis in Europe, Latin America, or elsewhere could negatively impact currencies, global financial markets, social and political stability, funding sources and costs, asset and obligation values, customers, suppliers, demand for equipment, and company operations and results. The company’s investment management activities could be impaired by changes in the equity, bond, and other financial markets, which would negatively affect earnings.\nContinued effects of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union could adversely affect business activity, political stability, and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union, and elsewhere. The economic conditions and outlook could be further adversely affected by (i) uncertainty regarding any new or modified trade arrangements between the United Kingdom and the European Union and/or other countries; (ii) the risk that one or more other European Union countries could come under increasing pressure to leave the European Union; or (iii) the risk that the euro as the single currency of the eurozone could cease to exist. Any of these developments could affect our businesses, liquidity, results of operations, and financial position.\nAdditional factors that could materially affect the company’s operations, access to capital, expenses, and results include changes in, uncertainty surrounding, and the impact of governmental trade, banking, monetary, and fiscal policies, including financial regulatory reform and its effects on the consumer finance industry, derivatives, funding costs, and other areas; the potential default of the U.S. federal government if Congress fails to pass a 2022 budget resolution; governmental programs, policies, and tariffs for the benefit of certain industries or sectors; sanctions in particular jurisdictions; retaliatory actions to such changes in trade, banking, monetary, and fiscal policies; actions by central banks; actions by financial and securities regulators; actions by environmental, health, and safety regulatory agencies, including those related to engine emissions, carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, noise, and the effects of climate change; changes to GPS radio frequency bands or their permitted uses; changes in labor and immigration regulations; changes to accounting standards; changes in tax rates, estimates, laws, and regulations and\n38\n​\ncompany actions related thereto; changes to and compliance with privacy, banking, and other regulations; changes to and compliance with economic sanctions and export controls laws and regulations; compliance with U.S. and foreign laws when expanding to new markets and otherwise; and actions by other regulatory bodies.\nOther factors that could materially affect the company’s results include production, design, and technological innovations and difficulties, including capacity and supply constraints and prices; the loss of or challenges to intellectual property rights, whether through theft, infringement, counterfeiting, or otherwise; the availability and prices of strategically sourced materials, components, and whole goods; delays or disruptions in the company’s supply chain or the loss of liquidity by suppliers; disruptions of infrastructures that support communications, operations, or distribution; the failure of customers, dealers, suppliers, or the company to comply with laws, regulations, and company policy pertaining to employment, human rights, health, safety, the environment, sanctions, export controls, anti-corruption, privacy and data protection, and other ethical business practices;\nintroduction of legislation that could affect the company’s business model and intellectual property, such as right to repair or right to modify; events that damage the company’s reputation or brand; significant investigations, claims, lawsuits, or other legal proceedings; start-up of new plants and products; the success of new product initiatives or business strategies; changes in customer product preferences and sales mix; gaps or limitations in rural broadband coverage, capacity, and speed needed to support technology solutions; oil and energy prices, supplies, and volatility; the availability and cost of freight; actions of competitors in the various industries in which the company competes, particularly price discounting; dealer practices, especially as to levels of new and used field inventories; changes in demand and pricing for used equipment and resulting impacts on lease residual values; labor relations and contracts, including work stoppages and other disruptions; changes in the ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified personnel; acquisitions and divestitures of businesses; greater-than-anticipated transaction costs; the integration of new businesses; the failure or delay in closing or realizing anticipated benefits of acquisitions, joint ventures, or divestitures; the inability to deliver precision technology and agricultural solutions to customers; the implementation of the smart industrial operating model and other organizational changes; the failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits of cost reduction, productivity, or efficiency efforts; difficulties related to the conversion and implementation of enterprise resource planning systems; security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, technology failures, and other disruptions to the information technology infrastructure of the company and its suppliers and dealers; security breaches with respect to the company’s products; changes in company-declared dividends and common stock issuances and repurchases; changes in the level and funding of employee retirement benefits; changes in market values of investment assets, compensation, retirement,\ndiscount, and mortality rates which impact retirement benefit costs; and significant changes in health care costs.\nThe liquidity and ongoing profitability of John Deere Capital Corporation and the company’s other financial services subsidiaries depend largely on timely access to capital in order to meet future cash flow requirements, and to fund operations, costs, and purchases of the company’s products. If general economic conditions deteriorate or capital markets become more volatile, funding could be unavailable or insufficient. Additionally, customer confidence levels may result in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact write-offs and provisions for credit losses.\nThe company’s forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions relating to the factors described above, which are sometimes based upon estimates and data prepared by government agencies. Such estimates and data are often revised. The company, except as required by law, undertakes no obligation to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. Further information concerning the company and its businesses, including factors that could materially affect the company’s financial results, is included in the company’s other filings with the SEC (including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this annual report on Form 10-K and the company’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q).\nSUPPLEMENTAL CONSOLIDATING INFORMATION\nThe supplemental consolidating data presented on the subsequent pages is presented for informational purposes. The equipment operations represents the enterprise without financial services. The equipment operations includes the company’s production and precision agriculture operations, small agriculture and turf operations, construction and forestry operations, and other corporate assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses not reflected within financial services. Transactions between the “equipment operations” and “financial services” have been eliminated to arrive at the consolidated financial statements.\nThe equipment operations and financial services participate in different industries. The equipment operations primarily generate earnings and cash flows by manufacturing and distributing equipment, service parts, and technology solutions to dealers and retail customers. Financial services primarily finances sales and leases by dealers of new and used equipment that is largely manufactured by the company. Those earnings and cash flows generally are the difference between the finance income received from customer payments less interest expense, and depreciation on equipment subject to an operating lease. The two businesses are capitalized differently and have separate performance metrics. The supplemental consolidating data is also used by management due to these differences.\n​\n39\n​\nSUPPLEMENTAL CONSOLIDATING DATA\n​\n​\n​\n1\nThe equipment operations represents the enterprise without financial services.

As a result, the company enters into derivative transactions to manage certain of these exposures that arise in the normal course of business and not for the purpose of creating speculative positions or trading. The company’s financial services operations manage the relationship of the types and amounts of their funding sources to their receivable and lease portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations while responding to favorable financing opportunities. In addition, the company has interest rate exposure at certain equipment operations units for below market retail financing programs that are used as sales incentives and are offered for extended periods. Accordingly, from time to time, these operations enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage their interest rate exposure. The company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic operations related to buying, selling, and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies. The company has entered into agreements related to the management of these foreign currency transaction risks.\nInterest Rate Risk\nQuarterly, the company uses a combination of cash flow models to assess the sensitivity of its financial instruments with interest rate exposure to changes in market interest rates. The models calculate the effect of adjusting interest rates as follows: cash flows for financing receivables are discounted at the current prevailing rate for each receivable portfolio, cash flows for marketable securities are primarily discounted at the applicable benchmark yield curve plus market credit spreads, cash flows for unsecured borrowings are discounted at the applicable benchmark yield curve plus market credit spreads for similarly rated borrowers, cash flows for securitized borrowings are discounted at the swap yield curve plus a market credit spread for similarly rated borrowers, and cash flows for interest rate swaps are projected and discounted using forward rates from the swap yield curve at the repricing dates. The net loss in these financial instruments’ fair values which would be caused by increasing the interest rates by 10 percent from the market rates at October 31, 2021 would have been approximately $19 million. The net loss from increasing the interest rates by 10 percent at November 1, 2020 would have been approximately $50 million.\nForeign Currency Risk\nIn the equipment operations, the company’s practice is to hedge significant currency exposures. Worldwide foreign currency exposures are reviewed quarterly. Based on the equipment operations’ anticipated and committed foreign currency cash inflows, outflows, and hedging policy for the next twelve months, the company estimates that a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies through 2022 would decrease the 2022 expected net cash inflows by approximately $113 million. At November 1, 2020, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar under similar assumptions and calculations indicated a potential $90 million adverse effect on the 2021 net cash inflows.\nIn the financial services operations, the company’s policy is to manage foreign currency risk through hedging strategies if the currency of the borrowings does not match the currency of the receivable portfolio. As a result, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the financial services cash flows.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n43\nDEERE & COMPANY\nSTATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED INCOM\nE\nFor the Years Ended October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019\n(In millions of dollars and shares except per share amounts)\n​\nThe notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.\n​\n44\nDEERE & COMPANY\nSTATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED COMPREHENSIVE IN\nCOME\nFor the Years Ended October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019\n(In millions of dollars)\n​\nThe notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.\n​\n​\n45\nDEERE & COMPANY\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET\nAs of October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020\n(In millions of dollars)\n​\nThe notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.\n​\n46\nDEERE & COMPANY\nSTATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED CASH F\nLOWS\nFor the Years Ended October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019\n(In millions of dollars)\n​\nThe notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.\n​\n47\nDEERE & COMPANY\nSTATEMENT OF CHANGES IN CONSOLIDATED STOCKHOLDERS\n’ EQUITY\nFor the Years Ended November 3, 2019, November 1, 2020, and October 31, 2021\n(In millions of dollars)\n​\nThe notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.\n​\n48\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. ORGANIZATION AND CONSOLIDATION\nStructure of Operations\nThe information in the notes and related commentary are presented in a format that includes data grouped as follows:\nConsolidated\n– Represents the consolidation of the equipment operations and financial services. References to “Deere & Company” or “the company” refer to the entire enterprise.\nEquipment Operations\n– Represents the enterprise without financial services, while including the company’s production and precision agriculture operations, small agriculture and turf operations, construction and forestry operations, and other corporate assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses not reflected within financial services.\nFinancial Services\n– Represents the company’s financing operations.\nNew Segment Reporting Structure\nIn fiscal year 2021, the company implemented a new operating model and reporting structure. With this change, the company’s agriculture and turf operations were divided into two new segments: production and precision agriculture (PPA) and small agriculture and turf (SAT). There were no changes to the construction and forestry (CF) and financial services (FS) segments. At the beginning of fiscal year 2021, the company also reclassified goodwill from identifiable operating assets to corporate assets for segment reporting, as goodwill is no longer considered in evaluating the operating performance of the segments. Additional information on the new segments and the segment financial results are presented in Note 28. Prior period segment information was recast for a consistent presentation. References to agriculture and turf include both production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements represent the consolidation of all companies in which Deere & Company has a controlling interest. Certain variable interest entities (VIEs) are consolidated since the company is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. Deere & Company records its investment in each unconsolidated affiliated company (generally 20 to 50 percent ownership) at its related equity in the net assets of such affiliate (see Note 11). Other investments (less than 20 percent ownership) are recorded at cost.\nFiscal Year\nThe company uses a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in the reporting period, which generally occurs in October. An additional week is included in the fourth fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the company’s fiscal quarters with the calendar. The fiscal year ends for 2021, 2020, and 2019 were October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019, respectively. Fiscal years 2021 and 2020 contained\n52\nweeks compared to\n53\nweeks in fiscal year 2019. Unless otherwise stated,\nreferences to particular years or quarters refer to the company’s fiscal years and the associated periods in those fiscal years.\nWirtgen Reporting Lag Removal\nPrior to November 2, 2020, the operating results of the Wirtgen Group (Wirtgen) were incorporated into the company’s consolidated financial statements using a one-month lag period. In 2021, the reporting lag was eliminated resulting in one additional month of Wirtgen activity in fiscal year 2021. The effect was an increase to “Net sales” of\n$\n270\nmillion, which the company considers immaterial to construction and forestry’s annual net sales. Prior period results were not restated.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe company consolidates certain VIEs related to retail note securitizations (see Note 14).\nThe company also has an interest in a joint venture that manufactures construction equipment in Indaiatuba, Brazil for local and overseas markets. The joint venture is a VIE; however, the company is not the primary beneficiary. Therefore, the entity’s financial results are not fully consolidated in the company’s consolidated financial statements but are included on the equity basis. In 2020, the investment in the joint venture was impaired. The maximum exposure to loss was $\n9\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. On August 19, 2021, the company announced the dissolution of the joint venture with Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. and the purchase of the shares in the relevant joint venture manufacturing entities, including the above referenced factory in Indaiatuba, Brazil. Refer to Note 4 for more details.\nArgentina\nThe company has equipment operations and financial services operations in Argentina. The U.S. dollar has historically been the functional currency for the company’s Argentina operations, as its business is generally indexed to the U.S. dollar due to the highly inflationary conditions. The Argentine government has certain capital and currency controls that restrict the company’s ability to access U.S. dollars in Argentina and remit earnings from its Argentine operations. As of October 31, 2021, the company's net investment in Argentina was approximately $\n578\nmillion. The company's net investment in its Argentine operations is likely to increase as Deere generates net income that is unable to be remitted. Net sales and revenues from the company’s Argentine operations represented approximately\n1\npercent of consolidated net sales and revenues for 2021. The company has employed mechanisms to convert Argentine pesos into U.S. dollars to the extent possible. The net peso exposure as of October 31, 2021 was approximately $\n3\nmillion. Argentine peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at each balance sheet date using the official currency exchange rate.\n49\n​\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe following are significant accounting policies in addition to those included in other notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nUse of Estimates in Financial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures. The COVID pandemic has resulted in uncertainties in the company’s business, which may result in actual results differing from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nSales of equipment and service parts are recognized when each of the following criteria are met: (1) the company and an independent customer approve a contract with commercial substance, (2) the sales price is determinable and collectability of the payments are probable based on the terms outlined in the contract, and (3) control of the goods has transferred to the independent customer. In most situations, the independent customer is a dealer, which subsequently sells the equipment and service parts purchased from the company to a retail customer, who can finance the equipment with the financial services segment or another source of financing. In some situations, the company sells directly to a retail customer. The term “customer” includes both dealers and retail customers to whom the company makes direct sales. Transfer of control generally occurs for equipment and service parts when the good is delivered as specified in the contract and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. In the U.S. and most international locations, this transfer occurs primarily when goods are shipped. In Canada and some other international locations, certain goods are shipped to dealers on a consignment basis under which the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the dealer at the time the goods are shipped. Accordingly, in these locations, sales are not recorded until a retail customer has purchased the goods. Generally, no right of return exists on sales of equipment.\nIn limited instances, equipment is transferred to a customer or a financial institution with an obligation to repurchase the equipment for a specified amount, which is exercisable at the customer’s option. When the equipment is expected to be repurchased, those arrangements are accounted for as leases. No sale is recorded at the time of the equipment transfer and the difference between sale price and the specified repurchase amount is recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis until the customer’s option expires. When this equipment is not expected to be repurchased, a sale is recorded with a return obligation.\nUnder the terms of sales agreements with dealers, interest-free periods are determined based on the type of equipment sold and the time of year of the sale. These periods range from\none\nto\ntwelve months\nfor most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be extended. Interest is primarily charged to dealers on outstanding balances, from the earlier of the date when goods are sold to a retail customer by the dealer or the expiration of the interest-free period granted at the time of the sale to the dealer,\nuntil payment is received by the company. Interest charged may not be forgiven and the past due interest rates exceed market rates. In 2020 and to a much lesser extent in 2021, short-term payment relief was provided to dealers due to the economic effects of COVID (see Note 13). Dealers cannot cancel purchases after the company recognizes a sale and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to retail customers. If the interest-free or below market interest rate period exceeds one year, the company adjusts the expected sales revenue for the effects of the time value of money using a current market interest rate. The revenue related to the financing component is recognized in “Finance and interest income” using the interest method. The company does not adjust the sales price to account for a financing component if the expected interest-free or below market period is\none\nyear or less.\nService parts and certain attachments returns are estimable and accrued at the time a sale is recognized. The estimated returns are recorded in “Other assets” for the inventory value of estimated returns, adjusted for restocking fees. The estimated dealer refund liability, adjusted for restocking fees, is recorded in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses.” The estimated returns are based on historical return rates, current dealer inventory levels, and current economic conditions.\nThe company remanufactures used engines and components (cores) that are sold to dealers and retail customers for maintenance and repair parts. Revenue for remanufactured components is recognized using the same criteria as other parts sales. When a remanufactured part is sold, the company collects a deposit that is repaid if the customer returns a core that meets certain specifications within a defined time period. The deposit received from the customer is recognized as a liability in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses” and the used component that is expected to be returned is recognized in “Other assets” in the consolidated balance sheet. When a customer returns a core, the deposit is repaid, the liability reversed, and the returned core is recorded in inventory to be remanufactured and sold to another customer. If a core is not returned within the required time, the deposit is recognized as revenue in “Net sales,” and the estimated core return is recorded as an expense in “Cost of sales” in the statement of consolidated income.\nCertain equipment is sold with precision guidance, telematics, and other information gathering and analyzing capabilities. These technology solutions require hardware, software, and may include an obligation to provide services for a period of time. These solutions are generally bundled with the sale of the equipment but can also be purchased or renewed separately. The revenue related to the hardware and embedded software is generally recognized at the time of the equipment sale and recorded in “Net sales” in the statement of consolidated income. The revenue for the future services is generally deferred and recognized over the service period. The deferred revenue is recorded as a contract liability in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses” in the consolidated balance sheet and is recognized in “Other income” with the\n50\n​\nassociated expenses recognized in “Other operating expenses” in the statement of consolidated income.\nFinancing revenue is recorded over the lives of the related receivables using the interest method. Deferred costs on the origination of financing receivables are recognized as a reduction in “Finance and interest income” over the expected lives of the receivables using the interest method. Income and deferred costs on the origination of operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the scheduled lease terms in “Finance and interest income.”\nSales Incentives\nIn certain markets, the company provides sales incentives to dealers. These incentives may be based on a dealer’s purchase volume or on retail sales incentive programs for allowances and financing programs that will be due when the dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. At the time of the sale to a dealer, the company records an estimated cost of these programs as a reduction to the sales price. The estimated cost is based on historical data, announced and expected incentive programs, field inventory levels, and forecasted sales volumes. The final cost of these programs is determined at the end of the measurement period for volume-based incentives or when the dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. Actual cost differences from the original cost estimate are recognized in “Net sales.”\nProduct Warranties\nFor most equipment and service parts sales, the company provides a standard warranty to provide assurance that the equipment will function as intended for a specified period. At the time a sale is recognized, the estimated future warranty costs are recorded. The company generally determines its total warranty liability by applying historical warranty claims rate experience to the estimated amount of equipment that has been sold and is still under warranty based on dealer inventories and retail sales. The historical claims rate is primarily determined by a review of\nfive-year\nclaims costs with consideration of current quality developments. The company also offers extended warranty arrangements for purchase at the customer’s option. The premiums for extended warranties are recognized in “Other income” in the statement of consolidated income primarily in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the contract period. The unamortized extended warranty premiums (deferred revenue) are recorded in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses” in the consolidated balance sheet (see Note 21).\nSales and Transaction Taxes\nThe company collects and remits taxes assessed by different governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transactions between the company and its customers. These taxes include sales, use, value-added, and some excise taxes. The company elected to exclude these taxes from the determination of the sales price (excluded from revenues).\nContract Costs\nIncremental costs of obtaining an equipment revenue contract are recognized as an expense when incurred since the amortization period would be\none\nyear or less.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are charged to expense as incurred. This expense was $\n212\nmillion in 2021, $\n196\nmillion in 2020, and $\n215\nmillion in 2019.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nProperty and equipment, capitalized software, and other intangible assets are generally stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. These assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives generally using the straight-line method. Equipment on operating leases is depreciated over the terms of the leases using the straight-line method. Property and equipment expenditures for new and revised products, increased capacity, and the replacement or major renewal of significant items are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs, and minor renewals are generally charged to expense as incurred.\nSecuritization of Receivables\nCertain financing receivables are periodically transferred to special purpose entities (SPEs) in securitization transactions (see Note 14). These securitizations qualify as collateral for secured borrowings and no gains or losses are recognized at the time of securitization. The receivables remain on the balance sheet and are classified as “Financing receivables securitized - net.” The company recognizes finance income over the lives of these receivables using the interest method.\nReceivables and Allowances\nAll financing and trade receivables are reported on the balance sheet at outstanding principal and accrued interest, adjusted for any write-offs, the allowance for credit losses, and any unamortized deferred fees or costs on originated financing receivables. The company also records an allowance and provision for credit losses related to the receivables from sales (trade receivables and certain financing receivables). The allowance is a reduction to the receivable balances and the provision is recorded in “Selling, administrative and general expenses.” The allowance represents an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of the receivable portfolio. The company measures expected credit losses on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Risk characteristics considered by the company include finance product category, market, geography, credit risk, and remaining duration. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics with other receivables in the portfolio are evaluated on an individual basis.\nThe company utilizes loss forecast models, which are selected based on the size and credit risk of the underlying pool of receivables, to estimate expected credit losses. Transition matrix models are used for large and complex retail customer receivable pools, while weighted average remaining maturity models are used for smaller and less complex retail customer receivable pools. Expected credit losses on wholesale receivables are based on historical loss rates, with consideration of current economic conditions and dealer financial risk. The modeled expected credit losses are adjusted based on reasonable and supportable forecasts, which may include economic indicators such as commodity prices, industry equipment sales, unemployment rates, and housing\n51\n​\nstarts. Management reviews each model’s output quarterly, and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary. Receivables are written-off to the allowance when the account is considered uncollectible (see Note 13).\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets\nThe company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets (including equipment on operating leases, property and equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets) when events or circumstances warrant such a review. Goodwill and unamortized intangible assets are tested for impairment annually at the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year, and more often if events or circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value below the carrying value. Goodwill is allocated and reviewed for impairment by reporting unit. Goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. To test for goodwill impairment, the carrying value of each reporting unit is compared with its fair value. If the carrying value of the goodwill is considered impaired, the impairment is measured as the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over the fair value, with a limit of the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset (see Notes 5 and 26).\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe company’s policy is derivative transactions are executed only to manage exposures arising in the normal course of business and not for the purpose of creating speculative positions or trading. The company’s financial services operations manage the relationship of the types and amounts of their funding sources to their receivable and lease portfolio in an effort to diminish risk due to interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, while responding to favorable financing opportunities. The company also has foreign currency exposures at some of its foreign and domestic operations related to buying, selling, and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies. In addition, the company has interest rate exposure at certain equipment operations units for below market retail financing programs that are used as sales incentives and are offered for extended periods.\nAll derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. Cash collateral received or paid is not offset against the derivative fair values on the balance sheet. Each derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, fair value hedge, or remains undesignated. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and reclassified to the income statement when the effects of the item being hedged are recognized in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and effective as fair value hedges are recognized currently in net income. These changes are offset in net income by fair value changes related to the risk being hedged on the hedged item. Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges are recognized currently in the income statement.\nAll designated hedges are formally documented as to the relationship with the hedged item as well as the risk-management strategy. Both at inception and on an ongoing basis the hedging instrument is assessed as to its effectiveness. If and when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge, the underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely to occur, the hedge designation is removed, or the derivative is terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued (see Note 27).\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currencies for most of the company’s foreign operations are their respective local currencies. The assets and liabilities of these operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the end of the period exchange rates. The revenues and expenses are translated at weighted-average rates for the period. The gains or losses from these translations are recorded in OCI. Gains or losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involved and foreign exchange derivative contracts are included in net income. The pretax net gain (loss) for foreign exchange in 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $(\n134\n) million, $\n18\nmillion, and $(\n13\n) million, respectively.\n3. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nNew Accounting Standards Adopted\nIn the first quarter of 2021, the company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU)\nNo. 2016-13\n, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which establishes Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. This ASU was adopted using a\nmodified-retrospective\napproach. The ASU, along with related amendments, revised the measurement of credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost from an incurred loss to an expected loss methodology. The ASU affects receivables, debt securities, net investment in leases, and most other financial assets that represent a right to receive cash.\nThe company holds deposits from dealers (dealer deposits), which are recorded in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses” to absorb certain credit losses. Prior to adopting this ASU, the allowance for credit losses was estimated on probable credit losses incurred after consideration of recoveries from dealer deposits. The ASU considers dealer deposits and certain credit insurance contracts as freestanding credit enhancements. As a result, after adoption, credit losses recovered from dealer deposits and certain credit insurance contracts are presented in “Other income” and no longer as part of the allowance for credit losses or the provision for credit losses. The ASU also modified the treatment of the estimated write-off of delinquent receivables by no longer including the estimated benefit of charges to the dealer deposits in the write-off amount. This change increases the estimated write-offs on delinquent financing receivables with the benefit of credit losses recovered from dealer deposits presented in “Other income.” This benefit, in both situations, is recorded when the dealer deposits are charged and no longer based on estimated recoveries.\n52\n​\nThe effects of adopting the ASU on the consolidated balance sheet were as follows in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nNote 13 contains additional disclosures, while the company’s updated allowance for credit losses accounting policy is included in Note 2 and the MD&A’s Critical Accounting Estimates.\nThe company also adopted the following standards in 2021, none of which had a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements:\n​\n​\nNew Accounting Standards to be Adopted\nThe company will adopt the following standards in future periods, none of which are expected to have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements:\n​\n​\n​\n4. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS\nPending Acquisitions\nIn August 2021, the company and Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. (Hitachi) entered into a Joint Venture Dissolution Agreement (Dissolution Agreement) pursuant to which the parties agreed to voluntarily terminate (Termination) the joint venture agreement dated May 16, 1988 between the company and Hitachi. The joint venture agreement governs the terms of the joint venture between the company and Hitachi for the manufacture and distribution of excavators in North, Central, and South America under the John Deere and Hitachi trademarks and\ntradenames. In connection with the Termination, the company will purchase all of Hitachi’s shares in the relevant joint venture manufacturing entities located in Kernersville, North Carolina, U.S.; Langley, British Columbia, Canada; and Indaiatuba, Brazil. The company will receive certain intellectual property rights relating to certain manufacturing processes under a perpetual license agreement. The initial cash consideration consists of $\n275\nmillion for the shares and an intellectual property license. The cash consideration will be offset by cash acquired and the settlement of intercompany balances. The company will also assume substantially all liabilities and debt of the joint venture entities. In addition to the foregoing payments, Hitachi will pay the book value of certain pre-existing inventory. Following the Termination, the company will purchase John Deere-branded excavators, components, and service parts from Hitachi under a new supply agreement with a duration that ranges from\n5\nto\n30 years\n. The company will also continue to manufacture 10-50 metric ton John Deere-branded excavators. The Termination is expected to close during the first half of fiscal year 2022, subject to the receipt of certain required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions. The company expects to fund the initial consideration and the transaction expenses from cash on hand.\nAcquisitions\nBear Flag\nIn August 2021, the company acquired Bear Flag Robotics, Inc. (Bear Flag) to further accelerate Deere’s development and delivery of advanced technology. Bear Flag’s technology is complementary to other Deere technology efforts and enables autonomous tractor operations. The total cash purchase price before final adjustments, net of cash acquired of\n$\n4\nmillion, was\n$\n225\nmillion, with an additional\n$\n25\nmillion to be recognized as compensation expense over the\nfour-year\npost-acquisition service period. In addition to the cash purchase price,\n$\n19\nmillion of liabilities were assumed. The preliminary asset and liability fair values at the acquisition date in millions of dollars follow:\n​\n​\nThe identified intangible was related to technology with a\nseven-year\namortization period. The goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes.\n53\n​\nUnimil\nIn September 2020, the company acquired Unimil, a leading Brazilian company in the after-sales service parts business for sugarcane harvesters, which is based in Piracicaba, Brazil. The total cash purchase price, net of cash acquired of\n$\n5\nmillion, was\n$\n66\nmillion, with\n$\n6\nmillion funded to an escrow to secure certain indemnity obligations. In addition to the cash purchase price,\n$\n14\nmillion of liabilities were assumed. The asset and liability fair values at the acquisition date in millions of dollars follow:\n​\n​\nThe identified intangibles were primarily related to customer relationships, trade name, and a non-compete agreement. The weighted-average amortization period is approximately\nnine years\n. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\nFor the acquisitions, the goodwill was the result of future cash flows and related fair value exceeding the fair value of the identified assets and liabilities. The results of these operations have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements in the production and precision agriculture operating segment and the pro forma results of operations as if these acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the current or comparative fiscal year would not differ significantly from the reported results.\nDispositions\nIn September 2020, the company sold its German lawn mower business. At the time of the sale, total assets were\n$\n26\nmillion, which were recorded in “Other assets,” and total liabilities were\n$\n5\nmillion, which were recorded in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses.”\nNo\ncash proceeds were received, resulting in a loss on sale, including transaction costs, of\n$\n24\nmillion pretax and\nafter-tax\n.\nThe loss was recorded with a pretax and after-tax accrual recognized in the third quarter of 2020 when a definitive sale agreement was finalized. The loss was recorded in “Other operating expenses” in the small agriculture and turf segment.\nIn October 2019, the company sold its construction and forestry retail locations in Canada. At the time of the sale, total assets were\n$\n187\nmillion consisting of inventory of\n$\n138\nmillion, property and equipment – net of\n$\n24\nmillion, other assets of\n$\n3\nmillion, and goodwill of\n$\n22\nmillion. The liabilities consisted of\n$\n10\nmillion of accounts payable and accrued expenses. In addition, the company accrued\n$\n15\nmillion for transaction expenses and related costs. The total proceeds from the sale were approximately\n$\n187\nmillion, with\n$\n93\nmillion received in 2019. The remaining sales price was due based on standard payment terms of new equipment sales to independent dealers and separately negotiated terms ranging from\n12 months\nto\nfive years\n. A pretax loss of approximately\n$\n5\nmillion was recorded in “Other operating expenses” in the construction and forestry segment.\nFor the retail location disposition, the company sells equipment, service parts, and provides other services to the purchaser as an independent dealer.\n​\n5. SPECIAL ITEMS\nIn 2021, the company sold a closed factory that previously produced small agricultural equipment in China, resulting in a $\n27\nmillion pretax gain. The fixed assets in an asphalt plant factory in Germany were impaired by $\n38\nmillion, pretax and\nafter-tax\n. The company also continued to assess its manufacturing locations, resulting in additional long-lived asset impairments of $\n12\nmillion pretax. The impairments were the result of a decline in forecasted financial performance that indicated it was probable future cash flows would not cover the carrying amount of the net assets. The company recognized a favorable indirect tax ruling in Brazil of $\n58\nmillion pretax. See Note 26 for fair value measurement information.\n​\n​\n​\n54\n​\nIn 2020, the company closed a factory that produced small agricultural equipment in China, recognized impairments in the fixed assets in an asphalt plant factory in Germany, a construction equipment factory in Brazil, and other international locations, recorded impairments of equipment on operating leases and matured lease inventory, as well as impairments of the investment in certain affiliate companies. See Note 26 for a description of the valuation methodologies used to measure these impairments.\n​\n​\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the company recorded non-cash charges in “Other operating expenses” of approximately $\n59\nmillion pretax for the impairment of equipment on operating leases and approximately $\n18\nmillion pretax on matured operating lease inventory recorded in “Other assets.” The impairment was the result of lower estimated values of used agriculture and construction equipment than originally estimated with the probable effect that the future cash flows would not cover the carrying amount of the net assets. The assets are part of the financial services operations (see Note 26).\nEmployee-Separation Programs\nDuring 2020, the company implemented employee-separation programs for the company’s salaried workforce in several geographic areas, including the U.S., Europe, Asia, and Latin America. The programs’ main purpose was to improve efficiency through a leaner, more flexible organization. The programs were largely voluntary in nature with the expense recorded primarily in the period in which the employees irrevocably accepted a separation offer. For the limited involuntary employee-separation programs, the expense was recorded when management committed to a plan, the plan was communicated to the employees, and the employees were not required to provide service beyond the legal notification period. The programs provided for cash payments based on years of service, and in some countries subsidized healthcare for a limited period and outplacement services.\nThe programs’ total pretax expenses in 2020 were as follows:\n​\n*    Relates primarily to non-cash charges of\n$\n34\nmillion from curtailments in certain OPEB plans (see Note 8) and other corporate expenses, both of which were recorded\noutside of operating profit\n.\nApproximately\n$\n6\nmillion of the curtailment charge was recorded by financial services.\n​\nDuring 2019, the company also completed certain employee-separation programs designed for specific functions and geographic areas as part of its on-going efforts to create a more efficient organizational structure. These programs provided for cash payments based on years of service. The expenses were recorded in the period the employees irrevocably accepted the separation offer with the following total pretax expenses:\n​\n​\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nIn 2020, the minority interest holder in Hagie Manufacturing Company, LLC exercised its right to sell the remaining\n20\npercent interest to the company for $\n14\nmillion. The arrangement was accounted for as an equity transaction with\nno\ngain or loss recorded in the statement of consolidated income. This operation is included in the company’s production and precision agriculture segment.\n55\n​\n6. REVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe company’s net sales and revenues by primary geographic market, major product line, and timing of revenue recognition in millions of dollars follow:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n56\n​\nFollowing is a description of the company’s major product lines:\nProduction Agriculture\n– Includes net sales of large and certain mid-size tractors and associated attachments, combines, cotton pickers, cotton strippers, sugarcane harvesters, sugarcane loaders and pull behind scrapers, tillage, seeding, and application equipment, including sprayers and nutrient management and soil preparation machinery, and related attachments and service parts.\nSmall Agriculture\n– Includes net sales of mid-size and utility tractors, self-propelled forage harvesters, hay and forage equipment, balers, mowers, and related attachments and service parts.\nTurf\n– Includes net sales of turf and utility equipment, including riding lawn equipment, golf course equipment, utility vehicles, and commercial mowing equipment, along with a broad line of associated implements, other outdoor power products, and related attachments and service parts.\nConstruction\n– Includes net sales of a broad range of machines used in construction, earthmoving, and material handling, including backhoe loaders, crawler dozers and loaders, four-wheel-drive loaders, excavators, motor graders, articulated dump trucks, and related attachments and service parts.\nCompact Construction\n– Includes net sales of smaller construction equipment, including compact excavators, compact track loaders, compact wheel loaders, skid steers, landscape loaders, and related attachments and service parts.\nRoadbuilding\n– Includes net sales of equipment used in roadbuilding and renovation, including milling machines, recyclers, slipform pavers, surface miners, asphalt pavers, compactors, tandem and static rollers, mobile crushers and screens, mobile and stationary asphalt plants, and related attachments and service parts.\nForestry\n– Includes net sales of equipment used in timber harvesting, including log skidders, feller bunchers, log loaders, log forwarders, log harvesters, and related attachments and service parts.\nFinancial Products\n– Includes finance and interest income primarily from retail notes related to sales of John Deere equipment to retail customers, wholesale financing to dealers of John Deere equipment, and revolving charge accounts; lease income from retail leases of John Deere equipment; and revenue from extended warranties.\nOther\n– Includes sales of components to other equipment manufacturers that are included in “Net sales”; and revenue earned over time from precision guidance, telematics, and other information enabled solutions, revenue from service performed at company owned dealerships and service centers, gains on disposition of property and businesses, trademark licensing revenue, and other miscellaneous revenue items that are included in “Other income.”\nThe company invoices in advance of recognizing the sale of certain products and the revenue for certain services. These items are\nprimarily for extended warranty premiums, advance payments for future equipment sales, and subscription and service revenue related to precision guidance and telematic services. These advanced customer payments are presented as deferred revenue, a contract liability, in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses” in the consolidated balance sheet. The deferred revenue received, but not recognized in revenue, including extended warranty premiums also shown in Note 21, was $\n1,344\nmillion and $\n1,090\nmillion at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. The contract liability is reduced as the revenue is recognized. Revenue recognized from deferred revenue that was recorded as a contract liability at the beginning of the fiscal year was $\n485\nmillion in 2021, $\n425\nmillion in 2020, and $\n444\nmillion in 2019.\nThe amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original duration greater than one year is $\n1,062\nmillion at October 31, 2021. The estimated revenue to be recognized by fiscal year follows in millions of dollars:\n2022\n- $\n339\n,\n2023\n- $\n289\n,\n2024\n- $\n199\n,\n2025\n- $\n101\n,\n2026\n- $\n64\n, and\nlater years\n- $\n70\n. As permitted, the company elected only to disclose remaining performance obligations with an original contract duration greater than one year. The contracts with an expected duration of one year or less are generally for sales to dealers and retail customers for equipment, service parts, repair services, and certain telematics services.\n​\n7. CASH FLOW INFORMATION\nThe company considers investments with purchased maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Substantially all of the company’s short-term borrowings, excluding the current maturities of finance lease obligations and long-term borrowings, mature or may require payment within three months or less.\nThe equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to financial services. These intercompany cash flows are eliminated in the consolidated cash flows.\nAll cash flows from the changes in trade accounts and notes receivable (see Note 13) are classified as operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows as these receivables arise from sales to the company’s customers. Cash flows from financing receivables that are related to sales to the company’s customers (see Note 13) are also included in operating activities. The remaining financing receivables are related to the financing of equipment sold by independent dealers and are included in investing activities.\nThe company had the following non-cash operating and investing activities that were not included in the statement of consolidated cash flows. The company transferred inventory to equipment on operating leases of\n$\n662\nmillion,\n$\n614\nmillion, and\n$\n678\nmillion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The company also had accounts payable related to purchases of property and equipment of\n$\n121\nmillion,\n$\n98\nmillion, and\n$\n152\nmillion at October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019, respectively.\n57\n​\nThe company’s restricted cash held at October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019 was as follows in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nThe restricted cash, recorded in “Other assets” in the consolidated balance sheet, primarily relates to securitization of financing receivables (see Note 14).\nCash payments for interest and income taxes consisted of the following in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\n​\n8. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nThe company has several funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans, primarily health care and life insurance plans, covering its U.S. employees and employees in certain foreign countries. The company uses an October 31 measurement date for these plans.\nThe components of net periodic pension cost and the assumptions related to the cost consisted of the following in millions of dollars and in percentages:\n​\n​\n​\nThe components of net periodic OPEB cost and the assumptions related to the cost consisted of the following in millions of dollars and in percentages:\n​\n​\nThe\n2020 OPEB curtailments\nwere a result of the employee-separation programs (see Note 5).\nThe spot yield curve approach is used to estimate the service and interest cost components of the net periodic pension and OPEB costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit plan obligations to relevant projected cash outflows. The components of net periodic pension and OPEB cost excluding the service component are primarily included in the line item “\nOther operating expenses\n” in the statement of consolidated income.\nThe previous pension cost in net income and other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations in other comprehensive income in millions of dollars were as follows:\n​\n​\n​\n58\n​\nThe previous OPEB cost in net income and other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations in other comprehensive income in millions of dollars were as follows:\n​\n​\nThe benefit plan obligations, funded status, and the assumptions related to the obligations at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively, in millions of dollars follow:\n​\n​\nThe company remeasured the U.S. hourly pension plan as of November 30, 2021 due to the new collective bargaining agreement, which decreased the plan’s funded status and increased pension expense in 2022. See Note 29 for more information.\nThe actuarial gain for pension for 2021 was primarily due to an increase in discount rates. The actuarial gain for OPEB for 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in health care trend rates, favorable mortality assumptions, and an increase in discount rates. The actuarial loss for pension for 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in discount rates partially offset by favorable mortality\nassumptions. The actuarial gain for OPEB for 2020 was primarily due to the U.S. enactment of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act (SECURE Act) that repealed the health insurance provider fee effective in 2021, favorable mortality assumptions, and a decrease in health care trend rates, partially offset by a decrease in discount rates.\nThe mortality assumptions for the 2021 and 2020 benefit plan obligations used the most recent tables and scales issued by the Society of Actuaries at that time. The 2021 mortality assumption includes an adjustment to the scale related to COVID.\nThe amounts recognized at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively, in millions of dollars consisted of the following:\n​\n​\nThe total accumulated benefit obligations for all pension plans at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, were\n$\n13,787\nmillion and\n$\n14,257\nmillion, respectively.\nThe accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were\n$\n2,012\nmillion and\n$\n1,207\nmillion, respectively, at October 31, 2021 and\n$\n2,107\nmillion and\n$\n1,100\nmillion, respectively, at November 1, 2020. The projected benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were\n$\n2,163\nmillion and\n$\n1,227\nmillion, respectively, at October 31, 2021 and\n$\n10,792\nmillion and\n$\n9,482\nmillion, respectively, at November 1, 2020.\nActuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). To the extent unamortized gains and losses exceed 10 percent of the higher of the market-related value of assets or the benefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a component of net periodic cost over the remaining service period of the active participants. For plans in which all or almost all of the plan’s participants are inactive, the amortization period is the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants.\nThe company makes any required contributions to the plan assets under applicable regulations and voluntary contributions after evaluating the company’s liquidity position and ability to make tax-deductible contributions. Total company contributions to the plans were $\n258\nmillion in 2021 and $\n951\nmillion in 2020, which included both required and voluntary contributions and direct benefit payments. The voluntary contributions to plan assets were $\n700\nmillion in 2020.\n59\n​\nThe company expects to contribute approximately\n$\n100\nmillion to its pension plans and approximately\n$\n1,150\nmillion to its OPEB plans in 2022. Fiscal year 2022 OPEB contributions include a voluntary contribution of\n$\n1,000\nmillion to a U.S. plan made on November 30, 2021 (see Note 29), which will increase plan assets. The pension and OPEB contributions exceeding the voluntary amounts primarily include direct benefit payments from company funds. The company has no significant required contributions to U.S. pension plan assets in 2022 under applicable funding regulations.\nThe benefits expected to be paid from the benefit plans, which reflect expected future years of service, are as follows in millions of dollars:\n​\n*       Net of prescription drug group benefit subsidy under Medicare Part D.\n​\n​\nThe annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits (the health care cost trend rates) used to determine accumulated postretirement benefit obligations were based on the trends for medical and prescription drug claims for pre- and post-65 age groups due to the effects of Medicare. For the 2021 obligation, the weighted-average composite trend rates were assumed to be a\n2.1\npercent increase from 2021 to 2022, followed by an increase of\n8.4\npercent from 2022 to 2023, gradually decreasing to\n4.7\nfrom\n2028 to 2029\nand all future years. The lower estimated increase from 2021 to 2022 resulted from a decrease in Medicare Advantage premiums. The 2020 obligations and the cost in 2021 assumed a\n4.0\npercent increase from 2020 to 2021, followed by an increase of\n7.6\npercent from 2021 to 2022, gradually decreasing to\n4.7\npercent from\n2027 to 2028\nand all future years. The lower estimated increase from 2020 to 2021 resulted from the SECURE Act that repealed the health insurance provider fee effective in 2021.\nThe discount rate assumptions used to determine the pension and OPEB obligations for all periods presented were primarily based on hypothetical AA yield curves represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates. These discount rates represent the rates at which the company’s benefit obligations could effectively be settled at the October 31 measurement dates.\nFair value measurement levels in the following tables are defined in Note 26.\nThe fair values of the pension plan assets at October 31, 2021 follow in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nThe fair values of the health care assets at October 31, 2021 follow in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\n​\n60\n​\nThe fair values of the pension plan assets at November 1, 2020 follow in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nThe fair values of the health care assets at November 1, 2020 follow in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nInvestments at net asset value in the preceding tables are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient and are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.\nFair values are determined as follows:\nCash and Short-Term Investments –\nThe investments include (1) cash accounts that are valued based on the account value, which approximates fair value; (2) investments that are valued at quoted prices in the active markets in which the investment trades or using a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data; and (3) investment funds that are valued based on a constant fund net asset value (NAV), which is based on quoted prices in the active market in which the investment fund trades, or the fund’s NAV using the NAV per share practical expedient, which is based on the fair value of the underlying securities.\nEquity Securities and Funds\n–\nThe values are determined by quoted prices in the active market in which the equity investment trades, or the fund’s NAV, based on the fair value of the underlying securities.\nFixed Income Securities and Funds and Other Funds\n–\nThe securities are valued using either a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, credit risk, and prepayment speeds, or they are valued using the quoted prices in the active market in which the fixed income investment trades. Fixed income and other funds are valued using the fund’s NAV, based on the fair value of the underlying securities.\nReal Estate, Venture Capital, Private Equity, and Hedge Funds\n–\nThe investments that are structured as limited partnerships are valued at estimated fair value based on their proportionate share of the limited partnership’s fair value that is determined by the respective general partner. These investments are valued using the fund’s NAV, which is based on the fair value of the underlying investments. Real estate investment trusts are primarily valued at the quoted prices in the active markets in which the investment trades.\nDerivative Instruments\n–\nThe derivatives are valued using either an income approach (discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs, including swap curves and both forward and spot exchange rates, or a market approach (quoted prices in the active market in which the derivative instrument trades).\nThe primary investment objective for the pension and health care plans assets is to fulfill the projected obligations to the beneficiaries over a long period of time, while meeting the company’s fiduciary responsibilities. The asset allocation policy is the most important decision in managing the assets and it is reviewed regularly. The asset allocation policy considers the company’s long-term asset class risk/return expectations for each plan since the obligations are long-term in nature. The current target allocations for pension assets are approximately\n26\npercent for equity,\n55\npercent for debt,\n4\npercent for real estate, and\n15\npercent for other investments. The target allocations for health care assets are approximately\n58\npercent for equity,\n35\npercent for debt,\n2\npercent for real estate, and\n5\npercent for other\n61\n​\ninvestments. The allocation percentages above include the effects of combining derivatives with other investments to manage asset allocations and exposures to interest rates and foreign currency exchange. The assets are well diversified and are managed by professional investment firms as well as by investment professionals who are company employees. As a result of the company’s diversified investment policy, there were no significant concentrations of risk.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects management’s expectations of long-term average rates of return on funds invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. A market related value of plan assets is used to calculate the expected return on assets. The market related value recognizes changes in the fair value of pension plan assets systematically over a\nfive-year\nperiod. The market related value of the health care plan assets equals fair value.\nThe expected return is based on the outlook for inflation and for returns in multiple asset classes, while also considering historical returns, asset allocation, and investment strategy. The company’s approach has emphasized the long-term nature of the return estimate such that the return assumption is not changed significantly unless there are fundamental changes in capital markets that affect the company’s expectations for returns over an extended period of time (i.e.,\n10\nto\n20 years\n). The average annual return of the company’s U.S. pension fund was approximately\n11.0\npercent during the past ten years and approximately\n9.3\npercent during the past 20 years. Since return premiums over inflation and total returns for major asset classes vary widely even over ten-year periods, recent history is not necessarily indicative of long-term future expected returns. The company’s systematic methodology for determining the long-term rate of return for the company’s investment strategies supports its long-term expected return assumptions.\nThe company has created certain Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association trusts (VEBAs) for the funding of postretirement health care benefits. The future expected asset returns for these VEBAs are lower than the expected return on the other pension and health care plan assets due to investment in a higher proportion of liquid securities. These assets are in addition to the other postretirement health care plan assets that have been funded under Section 401(h) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and maintained in a separate account in the company’s pension plan trust.\nThe company has defined contribution plans related to employee investment and savings plans primarily in the U.S. The company’s contributions and costs under these plans were\n$\n207\nmillion in 2021,\n$\n160\nmillion in 2020, and\n$\n192\nmillion in 2019. The contribution rate varies primarily based on the company’s performance in the prior year and employee participation in the plans.\n9. INCOME TAXES\nThe provision for income taxes by taxing jurisdiction and by significant component consisted of the following in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nBased upon the location of the company’s operations, the consolidated income before income taxes in the U.S. in 2021, 2020, and 2019 was\n$\n4,061\nmillion,\n$\n2,082\nmillion, and\n$\n2,166\nmillion, respectively, and in foreign countries was\n$\n3,541\nmillion,\n$\n1,801\nmillion, and\n$\n1,922\nmillion, respectively. Certain foreign operations are branches or partnerships of Deere & Company and are subject to U.S. as well as foreign income tax regulations. The pretax income by location and the preceding analysis of the income tax provision by taxing jurisdiction are not directly related.\nA comparison of the statutory and effective income tax provision and reasons for related differences in millions of dollars follow:\n​\n​\nAt October 31, 2021, accumulated earnings in certain subsidiaries outside the U.S. totaled\n$\n2,155\nmillion. A provision for foreign withholding taxes has\nno\nt been made since these earnings are expected to remain indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Determination of the amount of a foreign withholding tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable.\n62\n​\nDeferred income taxes arise because there are certain items that are treated differently for financial accounting than for income tax reporting purposes.\nAn analysis of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 in millions of dollars follows:\n​\n​\nDeere & Company files a consolidated federal income tax return in the U.S., which includes the wholly-owned financial services subsidiaries. These subsidiaries account for income taxes generally as if they filed separate income tax returns, with a modification for realizability of certain tax benefits.\nAt October 31, 2021, tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of\n$\n1,542\nmillion were available with\n$\n1,068\nmillion expiring from 2022 through 2041 and\n$\n474\nmillion with an indefinite carryforward period.\nA reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019 in millions of dollars follows:\n​\n​\nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 that would impact the effective tax rate if the tax benefits were recognized was\n$\n227\nmillion and\n$\n134\nmillion, respectively. The remaining liability was related to tax positions for which there are offsetting tax receivables, or the uncertainty was\nonly related to timing. The company expects that any reasonably possible change in the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months would not be significant.\nThe company files its tax returns according to the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates, which includes the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed the examination of the company’s federal income tax returns for periods prior to 2015.\nThe federal income tax returns for years 2015, 2016, and 2017 are currently under examination. Various state and foreign income tax returns, including major tax jurisdictions in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, India, Luxembourg, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, and Spain also remain subject to examination by taxing authorities.\nThe company’s policy is to recognize interest related to income taxes in interest expense and interest income and recognize penalties in selling, administrative and general expenses. During 2021 and 2019, the total amount of expense from interest and penalties was $\n7\nmillion and $\n13\nmillion. During 2020, interest and penalties previously recorded were reversed when tax positions were effectively settled resulting in a $\n3\nmillion net benefit. The interest income in 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $\n8\nmillion, $\n11\nmillion, and $\n25\nmillion, respectively. At October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, the liability for accrued interest and penalties totaled $\n75\nmillion and $\n72\nmillion, respectively, and the receivable for interest was $\n11\nmillion and $\n6\nmillion, respectively.\n10. OTHER INCOME AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES\nThe major components of other income and other operating expenses consisted of the following in millions of dollars:\n​\n*     Primarily related to extended warranties (s\nee Note 21).\n​\n63\n​\n11. UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATED COMPANIES\nUnconsolidated affiliated companies are companies in which Deere & Company generally owns 20 percent to 50 percent of the outstanding voting shares. Deere & Company does not control these companies and accounts for its investments in them on the equity basis. The investments in these companies primarily consist of Deere-Hitachi Construction Machinery Corporation (\n50\npercent ownership) and Deere-Hitachi Maquinas de Construcao do Brasil S.A. (\n50\npercent ownership). During 2021, the company sold its investment in Bell Equipment Limited, resulting in no material gain or loss. The company also entered into a Dissolution Agreement with Hitachi to terminate the joint venture agreement. The termination is expected to occur in 2022 (see Note 4). The unconsolidated affiliated companies primarily manufacture or market equipment. Deere & Company’s share of the income or loss of these companies is reported in the consolidated income statement under “Equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates.” In 2020, the company recorded impairments on certain unconsolidated affiliates. The impairments were the result of an other-than-temporary decline in value (see Note 5). The investment in these companies is reported in the consolidated balance sheet under “Investments in unconsolidated affiliates.”\nCombined financial information of the unconsolidated affiliated companies in millions of dollars follows:\n​\n​\n​\nConsolidated retained earnings at October 31, 2021 include undistributed earnings of the unconsolidated affiliates of\n$\n48\nmillion. Dividends from unconsolidated affiliates were\n$\n21\nmillion in 2021,\nnone\nin 2020, and\n$\n30\nmillion in 2019.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the company purchases and sells components and finished goods to the unconsolidated affiliated companies.\nTransactions with unconsolidated affiliated companies reported in the statement of consolidated income in millions of dollars follow:\n​\n​\n​\n12. MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nAll marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale.\nRealized gains or losses from the sales of marketable securities are based on the specific identification method.\nThe amortized cost and fair value of marketable securities at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 in millions of dollars follow:\n​\n*\nPrimarily issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises.\n​\nEquity Securities\nProceeds of equity securities sold during 2021, 2020, and 2019 were not material.\nUnrealized gains on equity securities during 2021 and 2020 in millions of dollars follow:\n​\n​\nDebt Securities\nThe contractual maturities of debt securities at October 31, 2021 in millions of dollars follow:\n​\n​\n​\n64\n​\nActual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because some securities may be called or prepaid. Because of the potential for prepayment on mortgage-backed securities, they are not categorized by contractual maturity. Proceeds from the sales of debt securities, realized gains, realized losses, the increase (decrease) in net unrealized gains or losses, and unrealized losses that have been continuous for over twelve months were not significant in 2021, 2020, and 2019. Unrealized losses at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 were not recognized in income due to the ability and intent to hold to maturity. There were\nno\nsignificant impairment write-downs in the periods reported.\n13. RECEIVABLES\nTrade Accounts and Notes Receivable\nTrade accounts and notes receivable at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 in millions of dollars follow:\n​\n​\nTrade accounts and notes receivable have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agriculture and turf market and construction and forestry market as shown in the previous table. On a geographic basis, there is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk in any area.\nThe allowance for credit losses on trade accounts and notes receivable at October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019, as well as the related activity, in millions of dollars follow:\n​\n​\nThe equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to financial services and provide compensation to financial services at approximate market interest rates.\nTrade accounts and notes receivable primarily arise from sales of goods to independent dealers. See Note 2 for the company’s revenue recognition policy. The company evaluates and assesses dealers on an ongoing basis as to their creditworthiness and generally secures the receivables by retaining a security interest in the goods associated with the trade receivables or with other financial instruments. In certain jurisdictions, the company is obligated to repurchase goods sold to a dealer upon cancellation or termination of the dealer’s contract for such causes as change in ownership and closeout of the business.\nDuring 2020 and to a much lesser extent in 2021, the company provided short-term payment relief on trade accounts and notes\nreceivable to customers that were negatively affected by the economic effects of COVID. The relief was provided both in regional programs and case-by-case situations with creditworthy customers. This relief generally included payment deferrals not exceeding\nthree months\n, extending interest-free periods for up to an additional\nthree months\nwith the total interest-free period not to exceed\none year\n, or reducing interest rates for a maximum of\nthree months\n. The trade receivables granted relief that remained outstanding at October 31, 2021 were not material. This balance at November 1, 2020 was\n$\n75\nmillion, or approximately\n2\npercent of the trade receivable portfolio. Outside of these actions, the company did not modify its normal sales terms with customers that are outlined in Note 2.\nFor customers who obtained payment relief, subsequent sales transactions are evaluated to confirm the revenue recognition criteria are met, including that the sales price is determinable and collectability of the payments is probable based on the terms outlined in the contract.\nFinancing Receivables\nWhile the company implemented a new operating model in fiscal year 2021 resulting in new operating segments, assets managed by financial services, including most financing receivables and equipment on operating leases, continue to be evaluated by market (agriculture and turf or construction and forestry).\nFinancing receivables at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 in millions of dollars follow:\n​\n​\nFinancing receivables have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agriculture and turf and construction and forestry markets as shown in the previous table. On a geographic basis, there is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk in any area. The company generally retains as collateral a security interest in the equipment associated with retail notes, wholesale notes, and financing leases.\n65\n​\nFinancing receivables at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 related to the company’s sales of equipment that were included in the table above consisted of the following in millions of dollars:\n​\n*\nThese retail notes generally arise from sales of equipment by company-owned dealers or through direct sales.\n​\nFinancing receivable installments, including unearned finance income, at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 were scheduled as follows in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nThe maximum terms for retail notes are generally\nseven years\nfor agriculture and turf equipment, and\nfive years\nfor construction and forestry equipment. The maximum term for financing leases is generally\nseven years\n. The average term for wholesale notes is less than\ntwelve months\n.\nPast due balances of financing receivables still accruing finance income represent the total balance held (principal plus accrued interest) with any payment amounts\n30 days\nor more past the contractual payment due date. Non-performing financing receivables represent loans for which the company has ceased accruing finance income. The company ceases accruing finance income when these receivables are generally\n90 days\ndelinquent. Generally, when receivables are\n120 days\ndelinquent the estimated uncollectible amount from the customer is written off to the allowance for credit losses. Finance income for non-performing receivables is recognized on a cash basis. Accrual of finance income is generally resumed when the receivable becomes contractually current and collections are reasonably assured.\nDue to the significant, negative effects of COVID on dealers and retail customers, the company provided short-term payment relief to dealers and retail customers during 2020, and to a much lesser extent in 2021. The relief was provided in regional programs and case-by-case situations with customers that were generally current in their payment obligations. This relief generally included payment deferrals or reduced financing rates of\nthree months\nor less. The financing receivables granted relief that remained outstanding at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 represented approximately\n3\npercent and\n4\npercent of the financing receivable portfolio, respectively. The majority of financing receivables granted short-term relief are beyond the deferral period and have either resumed making payments or are reported as delinquent based on the modified payment schedule.\nThe company monitors the credit quality of financing receivables based on delinquency status.\nThe credit quality analysis of retail notes, financing leases, and revolving charge accounts (collectively, retail customer receivables) was as follows in millions of dollars at October 31, 2021:\n​\n​\n​\n66\n​\nThe credit quality analysis of retail customer receivables was as follows in millions of dollars at November 1, 2020:\n​\n​\nThe credit quality analysis of wholesale receivables was as follows in millions of dollars at October 31, 2021:\n​\n​\n​\nThe credit quality analysis of wholesale receivables was as follows in millions of dollars at November 1, 2020:\n​\n​\n​\nAn analysis of the allowance for credit losses and investment in financing receivables follows in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\n​\n*    Individual allowances were not significant.\n​\n​\n67\n​\nIn 2021, the allowance for credit losses on retail notes and financing lease receivables increased due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13.\nThis was partially offset by lower expected losses in the construction and forestry market and better than expected performance of accounts granted payment relief due to the economic effects of COVID. The allowance for credit losses on revolving charge accounts decreased in 2021, reflecting a decrease due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 and continued improvement in the agricultural and turf market. In 2020, the negative economic effects related to COVID and other macroeconomic issues significantly affected certain retail customers, particularly purchasers of construction equipment.\nPast-due amounts over 30 days represented\n1.09\npercent and\n1.16\npercent of the receivables financed at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively.\nNon-performing receivables comprised\n.96\npercent and\n1.22\npercent of the financing receivables at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. The allowance for credit losses represented\n.43\npercent and\n.53\npercent of financing receivables outstanding at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. In addition, at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, the company’s financial services operations had\n$\n154\nmillion and\n$\n136\nmillion, respectively, of deposits primarily withheld from dealers and merchants as credit enhancements.\nA troubled debt restructuring is generally the modification of debt in which a creditor grants a concession it would not otherwise consider to a debtor that is experiencing financial difficulties. These modifications may include a reduction of the stated interest rate, an extension of the maturity dates, a reduction of the face amount or maturity amount of the debt, or a reduction of accrued interest.\nDuring 2021, 2020, and 2019, the company identified\n397\n,\n574\n, and\n522\nreceivable contracts as troubled debt restructurings with aggregate balances of\n$\n18\nmillion,\n$\n108\nmillion, and\n$\n36\nmillion pre-modification and\n$\n17\nmillion,\n$\n95\nmillion, and\n$\n35\nmillion post-modification, respectively. Troubled debt restructurings in 2021 and 2019 primarily related to retail notes, while 2020 modifications primarily related to wholesale receivables in Argentina.\nThe short-term relief related to COVID did not meet the definition of a troubled debt restructuring.\nIn 2021 and 2020, there were no significant troubled debt restructurings that subsequently defaulted and were written off. At October 31, 2021, the company had\nno\ncommitments to lend to customers whose accounts were modified in troubled debt restructurings.\nOther Receivables\nOther receivables at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 consisted of the following in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\n​\n14. SECURITIZATION OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES\nThe company, as a part of its overall funding strategy, periodically transfers certain financing receivables (retail notes) into VIEs that are SPEs, or non-VIE banking operations, as part of its asset-backed securities programs (securitizations). The structure of these transactions is such that the transfer of the retail notes does not meet the accounting criteria for sales of receivables, and is, therefore, accounted for as a secured borrowing. SPEs utilized in securitizations of retail notes differ from other entities included in the company’s consolidated statements because the assets they hold are legally isolated. Use of the assets held by the SPEs or the non-VIEs is restricted by terms of the documents governing the securitization transactions.\nIn these securitizations, the retail notes are transferred to certain SPEs, which in turn issue debt to investors, or to non-VIE banking operations, which provide funding directly to the company. The funding provided by these third-parties result in secured borrowings, which are recorded as “Short-term securitization borrowings” on the balance sheet. The securitized retail notes are recorded as “Financing receivables securitized - net” on the balance sheet. The total restricted assets on the balance sheet related to these securitizations include the financing receivables securitized, less an allowance for credit losses, and other assets primarily representing restricted cash. Restricted cash results from contractual requirements in securitized borrowing arrangements and serves as a credit enhancement. The restricted cash is used to satisfy payment deficiencies, if any, in the required payments on secured borrowings. The balance of restricted cash is contractually stipulated and is either a fixed amount as determined by the initial balance of the financing receivables securitized or a fixed percentage of the outstanding balance of the securitized financing receivables. The restriction is removed either after all secured borrowing payments are made or proportionally as these receivables are collected and borrowing obligations reduced. For those securitizations in which retail notes are transferred into SPEs, the SPEs supporting the secured borrowings are consolidated unless the company does not have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPEs’ economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the SPEs. No additional support to these SPEs beyond what was previously contractually required has been provided during the reporting periods.\nIn certain securitizations, the company consolidates the SPEs since it has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPEs’ economic performance through its role as servicer of all the receivables held by the SPEs, and the obligation through variable interests in the SPEs to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the SPEs. The restricted assets (retail notes securitized, allowance for credit losses, and other assets) of the consolidated SPEs totaled\n$\n3,094\nmillion and\n$\n2,898\nmillion at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. The liabilities (short-term securitization borrowings and accrued interest) of these SPEs totaled\n$\n3,024\n68\n​\nmillion and\n$\n2,856\nmillion at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. The credit holders of these SPEs do not have legal recourse to the company’s general credit.\nThe company has a revolving credit agreement to utilize bank conduit facilities to secure retail notes, described further in the following paragraphs. At October 31, 2021, the revolving credit agreement had a total capacity, or “financing limit,” of up to\n$\n2,000\nmillion of secured financings at any time. The agreement was renewed in November 2021 with an expiration in November 2022 and a capacity of\n$\n1,000\nmillion. As a result of the reduced capacity, the company repurchased\n$\n511\nmillion of outstanding short-term securitization borrowings in November 2021, in addition to the normal monthly liquidations as a result of payments collected on the retail notes.\nThrough the revolving credit agreement, the company transfers retail notes into bank-sponsored, multi-seller, commercial paper conduits, which are SPEs that are not consolidated. The company does not service a significant portion of the conduits’ receivables, and therefore, does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the conduits’ economic performance. These conduits provide a funding source to the company (as well as other transferors into the conduit) as they fund the retail notes through the issuance of commercial paper. The company’s carrying values and variable interest related to these conduits were restricted assets (retail notes securitized, allowance for credit losses, and other assets) of\n$\n1,176\nmillion and\n$\n1,327\nmillion at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. The liabilities (short-term securitization borrowings and accrued interest) related to these conduits were\n$\n1,113\nmillion and\n$\n1,275\nmillion at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively.\nThe company’s carrying amount of the liabilities to the unconsolidated conduits, compared to the maximum exposure to loss related to these conduits, which would only be incurred in the event of a complete loss on the restricted assets, was as follows at October 31, 2021 in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nThe total assets of the unconsolidated conduits related to securitizations were approximately\n$\n40\nbillion at October 31, 2021.\nIn addition, through the revolving credit agreement, the company transfers retail notes to banks, which may elect to fund the retail notes through the use of their own funding sources. These non-VIE banking operations are not consolidated since the company does not have a controlling interest in them. The company’s carrying values and interests related to the securitizations with the unconsolidated non-VIEs were restricted assets (retail notes securitized, allowance for credit losses and other assets) of\n$\n496\nmillion and\n$\n576\nmillion at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. The liabilities (short-term securitization borrowings and accrued interest) were\n$\n470\nmillion and\n$\n554\nmillion at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively.\nThe components of consolidated restricted assets related to secured borrowings in securitization transactions at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 were as follows in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nThe components of consolidated secured borrowings and other liabilities related to securitizations at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 were as follows in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nThe secured borrowings related to these restricted securitized retail notes are obligations that are payable as the retail notes are liquidated. Repayment of the secured borrowings depends primarily on cash flows generated by the restricted assets. Due to the company’s short-term credit rating, cash collections from these restricted assets are not required to be placed into a segregated collection account until immediately prior to the time payment is required to the secured creditors. At October 31, 2021, the maximum remaining term of all securitized retail notes was approximately\nseven years\n.\n15. INVENTORIES\nA majority of inventory owned by Deere & Company and its U.S. equipment subsidiaries are valued at cost, on the “last-in, first-out” (LIFO) basis. Remaining inventories are generally valued at the lower of cost, on the “first-in, first-out” (FIFO) basis, or net realizable value.\nThe value of gross inventories on the LIFO basis at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 represented\n54\npercent and\n52\npercent, respectively, of worldwide gross inventories at FIFO value. The pretax favorable income effect from the liquidation of LIFO inventory during 2020 was $\n33\nmillion.\nIf all inventories had been valued on a FIFO basis, estimated inventories by major classification at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 in millions of dollars would have been as follows:\n​\n​\n​\n69\n​\n16. PROPERTY AND DEPRECIATION\nA summary of property and equipment at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 in millions of dollars follows:\n​\n*\nWeighted-averages\n​\nTotal property and equipment additions in 2021, 2020, and 2019 were\n$\n897\nmillion,\n$\n815\nmillion, and\n$\n1,107\nmillion and depreciation was\n$\n830\nmillion,\n$\n800\nmillion, and\n$\n779\nmillion, respectively. Capitalized interest was\n$\n3\nmillion,\n$\n6\nmillion, and\n$\n7\nmillion in the same periods, respectively. The cost of leased property and equipment under finance leases of\n$\n131\nmillion and\n$\n99\nmillion and accumulated depreciation of\n$\n60\nmillion and\n$\n36\nmillion at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively, is included in property and equipment.\nCapitalized software has an estimated useful life of\nthree years\n. The amounts of total capitalized software costs, including purchased and internally developed software, classified as “Other assets” at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 were\n$\n1,326\nmillion and\n$\n1,339\nmillion, less accumulated amortization of\n$\n1,044\nmillion and\n$\n1,070\nmillion, respectively. Capitalized interest on software was\n$\n2\nmillion and\n$\n3\nmillion at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. Amortization of these software costs in 2021, 2020, and 2019 was\n$\n121\nmillion,\n$\n133\nmillion, and\n$\n150\nmillion, respectively.\nThe cost of compliance with foreseeable environmental requirements has been accrued and did not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements.\n17. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS – NET\nThe changes in amounts of goodwill by operating segments were as follows in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nThere were\nno\naccumulated goodwill impairment losses in the reported periods.\nThe components of other intangible assets are as follows in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nOther intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. The amortization of other intangible assets in 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $\n116\nmillion, $\n102\nmillion, and $\n109\nmillion, respectively. The estimated amortization expense for the next five years is as follows in millions of dollars: 2022 - $\n113\n, 2023 - $\n112\n, 2024 - $\n108\n, 2025 - $\n105\n, and 2026 - $\n103\n.\n​\n70\n​\n18. TOTAL SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS\nTotal short-term borrowings at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 consisted of the following in millions of dollars:\n​\n*\nIncludes unamortized fair value adjustments related to interest rate swaps.\n​\nThe short-term securitization borrowings are secured by financing receivables (retail notes) on the balance sheet (see Note 14) and presented net of debt acquisition costs. Although these securitization borrowings are classified as short-term since payment is required if the retail notes are liquidated early, the payment schedule for these borrowings at October 31, 2021 based on the expected liquidation of the retail notes in millions of dollars is as follows: 2022 -\n$\n2,556\n, 2023 -\n$\n1,150\n, 2024 -\n$\n623\n, 2025 -\n$\n231\n, 2026 -\n$\n44\n, and later years -\n$\n6\n.\nThe weighted-average interest rates on total short-term borrowings, excluding current maturities of finance lease obligations and long-term borrowings, at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 were\n.9\npercent and\n1.6\npercent, respectively.\nLines of credit available from U.S. and foreign banks were\n$\n8,336\nmillion at October 31, 2021. At October 31, 2021,\n$\n5,770\nmillion of these worldwide lines of credit were unused. For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings, excluding secured borrowings and the current portion of long-term borrowings, were primarily considered to constitute utilization. Included in the total credit lines at October 31, 2021 was a 364-day credit facility agreement of\n$\n3,000\nmillion, expiring in fiscal April 2022. In addition, total credit lines included long-term credit facility agreements of\n$\n2,500\nmillion, expiring in fiscal April 2025, and\n$\n2,500\nmillion, expiring in\nfiscal March 2026. The agreements are mutually extendable and the annual facility fees are not significant. These credit agreements require Capital Corporation to maintain its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges at not less than\n1.05\nto 1 for each fiscal quarter and the ratio of senior debt, excluding securitization indebtedness, to capital base (total subordinated debt and stockholder’s equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) at not more than\n11\nto 1 at the end of any fiscal quarter.\nThe credit agreements also require the equipment\noperations to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capital (total debt and stockholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)) of\n65\npercent or less at the end of each fiscal quarter. Under this provision, the company’s excess equity capacity and retained earnings balance free of restriction at October 31, 2021 was\n$\n15,388\nmillion. Alternatively under this provision, the equipment operations had the capacity to incur additional debt of\n$\n28,579\nmillion at October 31, 2021. All of these credit agreement requirements have been met during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.\nDeere & Company has an agreement with Capital Corporation pursuant to which it has agreed to continue to own, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least\n51\npercent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to maintain Capital Corporation’s consolidated tangible net worth at not less than\n$\n50\nmillion. This agreement also obligates Deere & Company to make payments to Capital Corporation such that its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than\n1.05\nto 1 for each fiscal quarter. Deere & Company’s obligations to make payments to Capital Corporation under the agreement are independent of whether Capital Corporation is in default on its indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities. Further, Deere & Company’s obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of Capital Corporation’s indebtedness, obligations, or other liabilities. Deere & Company’s obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation, or liability of Capital Corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. No payments were required under this agreement during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements. At October 31, 2021, Deere & Company indirectly owned\n100\npercent of the voting shares of Capital Corporation’s capital stock and Capital Corporation’s consolidated tangible net worth was\n$\n4,524\nmillion.\n71\n​\n19. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 consisted of the following in millions of dollars:\n​\n*    Pri\nmarily sales incentive accruals with a right of set-off against trade receivables. At October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020,\n$\n836\nmillion and\n$\n1,073\nmillion, respectively, of sales incentive accruals were classified as accrued expenses by the equipment operations as the related trade receivables had been sold to financial services.\n​\n20. LONG-TERM BORROWINGS\nLong-term borrowings at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 consisted of the following in millions of dollars:\n​\n*\nIncludes unamortized fair value adjustments related to interest rate swaps.\n**  All interest rates are as of year-end.\n​\nThe principal amounts of the equipment operations’ long-term borrowings maturing in each of the next five years in millions of dollars are as follows: 2022 -\n$\n1,214\n, 2023 -\n$\n585\n, 2024 -\n$\n935\n, 2025 -\n$\n700\n, and 2026 -\n$\n0\n. The principal amounts of the financial services’ long-term borrowings maturing in each of the next five years in millions of dollars are as follows: 2022 -\n$\n7,120\n, 2023 -\n$\n6,834\n, 2024 -\n$\n6,089\n, 2025 -\n$\n2,305\n, and 2026 -\n$\n3,373\n.\n72\n​\n21. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe company generally determines its total warranty liability by applying historical claims rate experience to the estimated amount of equipment that has been sold and is still under warranty based on dealer inventories and retail sales. The historical claims rate is primarily determined by a review of\nfive-year\nclaims costs and current quality developments.\nThe premiums for extended warranties are primarily recognized in income in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the contract period.\nThe unamortized extended warranty premiums (deferred revenue) included in the following table totaled\n$\n774\nmillion and\n$\n638\nmillion at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively.\nA reconciliation of the changes in the warranty liability and unearned premiums in millions of dollars follows:\n​\n​\nAt October 31, 2021, the company had approximately\n$\n409\nmillion of guarantees issued primarily to banks outside the U.S. and Canada related to third-party receivables for the retail financing of John Deere equipment. The company may recover a portion of any required payments incurred under these agreements from repossession of the equipment collateralizing the receivables. At October 31, 2021, the company had accrued losses of approximately\n$\n6\nmillion under these agreements. The maximum remaining term of the receivables guaranteed at October 31, 2021 was about\nsix years\n.\nAt October 31, 2021, the company had commitments of approximately\n$\n254\nmillion for the construction and acquisition of property and equipment. Also at October 31, 2021, the company had restricted assets of\n$\n68\nmillion, classified as “Other assets.” See Note 14 for additional restricted assets associated with borrowings related to securitizations.\nThe company also had other miscellaneous contingent liabilities totaling approximately\n$\n75\nmillion at October 31, 2021. The accrued liability for these contingencies was not material at October 31, 2021.\nThe company has commitments to extend credit to customers through lines of credit and other pre-approved credit arrangements. The amount of unused commitments to extend credit to John Deere dealers was approximately\n$\n14\nbillion at October 31, 2021. The amount of unused commitments to extend credit to retail customers was approximately\n$\n30\nbillion at October 31, 2021, primarily related to revolving charge accounts. A significant portion of these commitments is not expected to be\nfully drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts likely do not represent a future cash requirement. The company generally has the right to unconditionally cancel, alter, or amend the terms of these commitments at any time. The company recorded a provision for credit losses on unused commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable of\n$\n2\nmillion in 2021.\nThe company is subject to various unresolved legal actions which arise in the normal course of its business, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability (including asbestos related liability), retail credit, employment, patent, and trademark matters. The company believes the reasonably possible range of losses for these unresolved legal actions would not have a material effect on its financial statements.\n​\n22. CAPITAL STOCK\nThe\n$\n1\npar value common stock of Deere & Company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “DE”. At October 31, 2021, there were\n18,466\nholders of record of the company’s common stock.\nThe number of common shares the company is authorized to issue is\n1,200\nmillion. The number of common shares issued at October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020, and November 3, 2019 was\n536.4\nmillion. The number of authorized preferred shares,\nnone\nof which has been issued, is\nnine\nmillion.\nThe Board of Directors at a meeting in December 2019 authorized the repurchase of up to\n$\n8,000\nmillion of common stock. At the end of fiscal year 2021, this repurchase program had\n$\n5,811\nmillion (\n17.0\nmillion shares based on the fiscal year end closing common stock price of\n$\n342.31\nper share) remaining to be repurchased. Repurchases of the company’s common stock under this plan will be made from time to time, at the company’s discretion, in the open market.\nA reconciliation of basic and diluted net income per share attributable to Deere & Company follows in millions, except per share amounts:\n​\n​\nAll stock options outstanding were included in the computation except\n.6\nmillion in 2020 and\n.7\nmillion in 2019 that had an antidilutive effect under the treasury stock method.\n​\n23. STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS\nThe company issues stock options and restricted stock unit awards to key employees under plans approved by stockholders. Restricted stock units are also issued to nonemployee directors for their services as directors under a plan approved by stockholders. Options are awarded with the exercise price equal to the market\n73\n​\nprice and become exercisable in\none\nto\nthree years\nafter grant. Options expire\nten years\nafter the date of grant. Restricted stock awards generally vest after\nthree years\n. The compensation cost for stock options and service-based restricted stock units, which is based on the fair value at the grant date, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite period the employee is required to render service. The compensation cost for performance/service-based units, which is based on the fair value at the grant date excluding dividends, is recognized over the employees’ requisite service period and periodically adjusted for the probable number of shares to be awarded. The company recognizes the effect of award forfeitures as an adjustment to compensation expense in the period the forfeiture occurs.\nAccording to these plans, at October 31, 2021, the company is authorized to grant an additional\n17.7\nmillion shares related to stock options or restricted stock units. The company currently uses shares that have been repurchased through its stock repurchase programs to satisfy share option exercises.\nThe fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice option valuation model. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from traded call options on the company’s stock. The expected volatilities are constructed from the following three components: the starting implied volatility of short-term call options traded within a few days of the valuation date; the predicted implied volatility of long-term call options; and the trend in implied volatilities over the span of the call options’ time to maturity. The company uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model based on the underlying distribution of historical exercise behavior and represents the weighted-average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rates utilized for periods throughout the contractual life of the options are based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of grant.\nThe assumptions used for the binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of options follow:\n​\n*    Weighted-averages\n​\nStock option activity at October 31, 2021, and changes during 2021 in millions of dollars and shares follow:\n​\n*    Weighted-averages\n​\n​\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair values of options granted during 2021, 2020, and 2019 were\n$\n62.73\n,\n$\n35.83\n, and\n$\n46.96\n, respectively. The total intrinsic values of options exercised during 2021, 2020, and 2019 were\n$\n318\nmillion,\n$\n398\nmillion, and\n$\n186\nmillion, respectively. During 2021, 2020, and 2019, cash received from stock option exercises was\n$\n148\nmillion,\n$\n331\nmillion, and\n$\n178\nmillion, respectively, with tax benefits of\n$\n71\nmillion,\n$\n93\nmillion, and\n$\n44\nmillion, respectively.\nThe service-only based units award one share of common stock for each unit at the end of the vesting period and include dividend equivalent payments. The performance/service based units are subject to a performance metric based on the company’s compound annual revenue growth rate, compared to a benchmark group of companies over the vesting period. The performance/service based units award common stock in a range of\nzero\nto\n200\npercent for each unit granted based on the level of the metric achieved and do not\ninclude dividend equivalent payments over the vesting period. The weighted-average fair values of the service-only based units at the grant dates during 2021, 2020, and 2019 were\n$\n258.86\n,\n$\n168.94\n, and\n$\n149.54\nper unit, respectively, based on the market price of a share of underlying common stock. The fair value of the performance/service based units at the grant date during 2021, 2020, and 2019 were\n$\n245.73\n,\n$\n160.81\n, and\n$\n140.49\nper unit, respectively, based on the market price of a share of underlying common stock excluding dividends.\nThe company’s restricted stock units at October 31, 2021 and changes during 2021 in millions of shares follow:\n​\n*\nWeighted-averages\n​\nDuring 2021, 2020, and 2019, the total share-based compensation expense was\n$\n82\nmillion,\n$\n81\nmillion, and\n$\n82\nmillion, respectively, with recognized income tax benefits of\n$\n16\nmillion,\n$\n19\nmillion, and\n$\n20\nmillion, respectively. At October 31, 2021, there was\n$\n63\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost from share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans, which is related to restricted shares and options. This compensation is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately\ntwo years\n. The total grant-date fair values of stock options and restricted shares vested during 2021, 2020, and 2019 were\n$\n93\nmillion,\n$\n79\nmillion, and\n$\n66\nmillion, respectively.\n74\n​\n24.

LEASES\nThe company is both a lessee and a lessor. The company leases for its own use primarily warehouse facilities, office space, production equipment, information technology equipment, and vehicles. The expected use periods generally range from less than\none year\nto\n20 years\n. The company’s financial services segment leases to users equipment produced or sold by the company, and a limited amount of other equipment. These leases are usually written for periods of less than\none year\nto\nseven years\n. The company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at the contract inception.\nLessee\nThe company recognizes on the balance sheet a lease liability and a right of use asset for leases with a term greater than one year for both operating and finance leases.\nThe amounts of the lease liability and right of use asset are determined at lease commencement and are based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. The lease payments are discounted using the company’s incremental borrowing rate since the rate implicit in the lease is generally not readily determinable. The company determines the incremental borrowing rate for each lease based primarily on the lease term and the economic environment of the country where the asset will be used, adjusted as if the borrowings were collateralized. Leases with contractual periods greater than one year and that do not meet the finance lease criteria are classified as operating leases.\nCertain real estate leases contain one or more\noptions\nto\nterminate\nor\nrenew\n,\nwith terms\nthat can generally extend the lease term from\none\nto\nten years\n. Options that the company is reasonably certain to exercise are included in the lease term.\nThe company has elected to combine lease and nonlease components, such as maintenance and utilities costs included in a lease contract, for all asset classes.\nLeases with an initial term of one year or less are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in short-term lease expense.\nVariable lease expense primarily includes warehouse facilities leases with payments based on utilization exceeding contractual minimum amounts and leases with payments indexed to inflation when the index changes after lease commencement.\nThe lease expense by type consisted of the following in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nOperating and finance lease right of use assets and lease liabilities follow in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nThe weighted-average remaining lease terms in years and discount rates follows:\n​\n​\nLease payment amounts in each of the next five years at October 31, 2021 follow in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities follows in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nRight of use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities follow in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\n76\n​\nLessor\nThe company leases equipment manufactured or sold by the company and a limited amount of non-John Deere equipment to retail customers through sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases. Sales-type and direct financing leases are reported in “Financing receivables - net” on the consolidated balance sheet. Operating leases are reported in “Equipment on operating leases - net” on the consolidated balance sheet.\nLeases\noffered\nby the company may include\nearly\ntermination\nand\nrenewal\noptions\n. At the end of a lease, the lessee generally has the\noption\nto\npurchase\nthe\nunderlying\nequipment for a fixed price or return it to the dealer. If the equipment is returned to the dealer, the dealer also has the option to purchase the equipment or return it to the company for remarketing.\nThe company estimates the residual values for operating leases at lease inception based on several factors, including lease term, expected hours of usage, historical wholesale sale prices, return experience, intended use of the equipment, market dynamics and trends, and dealer residual guarantees. The company reviews residual value estimates during the lease term and tests the carrying value of its operating lease assets for impairment when events or circumstances necessitate. The depreciation is adjusted on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term if residual value estimates change. Lease agreements include usage limits and specifications on machine condition, which allow the company to assess lessees for excess use or damages to the underlying equipment.\nIn 2020 and 2019, the company recorded impairment losses on operating leases of $\n22\nmillion and $\n59\nmillion, respectively, due to higher expected equipment return rates and lower estimated values of used construction equipment. Operating lease impairments were recorded in “Other operating expenses.”\nThe company has elected to\ncombine lease and nonlease components\n. The nonlease components primarily relate to preventative maintenance and extended warranty agreements financed by the retail customer. The company has also elected to report consideration related to\nsales and value added taxes\nnet of the related tax expense. Property taxes on leased assets are recorded on a gross basis in “Finance and interest income” and “Other operating expenses” on the statement of consolidated income. Variable lease revenues primarily relate to property taxes on leased assets in certain markets and late fees. Variable lease revenues also include excess use and damage fees of $\n7\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion for 2021 and 2020, respectively, which were reported in “Other income” on the statement of consolidated income.\nDue to the significant, negative effects of COVID, the company provided short-term relief to lessees during 2020, and to a much lesser extent in 2021. The relief, which included payment deferrals of\nthree months\nor less, was provided in regional programs and on a case-by-case basis with customers that were generally current in their payment obligations. The operating leases granted relief represented approximately\n2\npercent and\n4\npercent of the company’s operating lease portfolio at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. The majority of operating leases granted short-term relief are beyond the deferral period and have\nresumed making payments. See Note 13 for sales-type and direct financing leases provided payment relief.\nLease revenues earned by the company follow in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nAt the time of accepting a lease that qualifies as a sales-type or direct financing lease, the company records the gross amount of lease payments receivable, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and unearned finance income. The unearned finance income is recognized as revenue over the lease term using the interest method.\nSales-type and direct financing lease receivables by market follow in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nScheduled payments, including guaranteed residual values, on sales-type and direct financing lease receivables at October 31, 2021 follow in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nLease payments from operating leases are recorded as income on a straight-line method over the lease terms. Operating lease assets are recorded at cost and depreciated to their estimated residual value on a straight-line method over the terms of the leases.\nThe cost of equipment on operating leases by market follow in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nThe total operating lease residual values at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 were $\n5,025\nmillion and $\n5,254\nmillion, respectively. Certain operating leases are subject to residual value\n77\n​\nguarantees. The total residual value guarantees were $\n950\nmillion and $\n757\nmillion at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. The residual value guarantees at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 include $\n3\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion, respectively, of dealer deposits available for potential losses on residual values.\nThe equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The corresponding depreciation expense was $\n983\nmillion in 2021, $\n1,083\nmillion in 2020, and $\n981\nmillion in 2019.\nLease payments for equipment on operating leases at October 31, 2021 were scheduled as follows in millions of dollars:\n​\n​\nPast due balances of operating leases represent the total balance held (net book value plus accrued lease payments) and still accruing financing income with any payment amounts\n30 days\nor more past the contractual payment due date. These amounts were $\n70\nmillion and $\n87\nmillion at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, respectively. The delinquency status of operating leases granted relief due to COVID is based on the modified payment schedule.\nThe company discusses with lessees and dealers options to purchase the equipment or extend the lease prior to lease maturity. Equipment returned to the company upon termination of leases is remarketed by the company and recorded in “Other assets” at the lower of net book value or estimated fair value of the equipment less costs to sell and is not depreciated. The matured operating lease inventory balances at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 were $\n30\nmillion and $\n70\nmillion, respectively. In 2020, the company recorded impairment losses on matured operating lease inventory of $\n10\nmillion due to lower estimated values of used construction equipment. Impairment losses on matured operating lease inventory were included in “Other operating expenses.”\n​\n26. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To determine fair value, the company uses various methods including market and income approaches. The company utilizes valuation models and techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs. The models are industry-standard models that consider various assumptions including time values and yield curves as well as other economic measures. These valuation techniques are consistently applied.\nLevel 1 measurements consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 measurements include significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets; observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves; and other market-corroborated inputs. Level 3 measurements include significant unobservable inputs.\nThe fair values of financial instruments that do not approximate the carrying values at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 in millions of dollars follow:\n​\n*\nFair value measurements above were Level 3 for all financing receivables, Level 3 for equipment operations short-term securitization borrowings, and Level 2 for all other borrowings.\n​\nFair values of the financing receivables that were issued long-term were based on the discounted values of their related cash flows at interest rates currently being offered by the company for similar financing receivables. The fair values of the remaining financing receivables approximated the carrying amounts.\nFair values of long-term borrowings and short-term securitization borrowings were based on current market quotes for identical or similar borrowings and credit risk, or on the discounted values of their related cash flows at current market interest rates. Certain long-term borrowings have been swapped to current variable interest rates. The carrying values of these long-term borrowings included adjustments related to fair value hedges.\n78\n​\nAssets and liabilities measured at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 at fair value on a recurring basis in millions of dollars follow, excluding the company’s cash equivalents, which were carried at cost that approximates fair value and consisted primarily of money market funds and time deposits. Level 3 marketable securities were transferred to Level 2 in 2021.\n​\n*    Primarily issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises.\n​\nFair value, nonrecurring measurements from impairments at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 in millions of dollars follow:\n​\n1\nFair value as of August 2, 2020.\n2\nFair value as of May 3, 2020.\n3\n2021 fair value of\n$\n41\nmillion at January 31, 2021. 2020 fair value of\n$\n70\nmillion at May 3, 2020,\n$\n8\nmillion at August 2, 2020, and\n$\n57\nmillion at November 1, 2020.\n4\nFair value as of November 1, 2020.\n5\n2021 fair value as of January 31, 2021. 2020 fair value as of May 3, 2020.\n​\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies the company uses to measure certain financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value:\nMarketable securities –\nThe portfolio of investments, except for the Level 3 measurement international debt securities, is primarily valued on a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, credit risk, and prepayment speeds. Funds are primarily valued using the fund’s net asset value, based on the fair value of the underlying securities. The Level 3 measurement international debt securities were primarily valued using an income approach based on discounted cash flows using yield curves derived from limited, observable market data.\nDerivatives\n–\nThe company’s derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate contracts (swaps), foreign currency exchange contracts (futures, forwards and swaps), and cross-currency interest rate contracts (swaps). The portfolio is valued based on an income approach (discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs, including swap curves and both forward and spot exchange rates for currencies.\nFinancing receivables –\nSpecific reserve impairments are based on the fair value of the collateral, which is measured using a market approach (appraisal values or realizable values). Inputs include a selection of realizable values (see Note 13).\nOther receivables\n– The impairment was based on the expected realization of value-added tax receivables related to a closed factory operation (see Note 5).\nEquipment on operating leases – net\n–\nThe impairments are based on an income approach (discounted cash flow), using the contractual payments, plus an estimate of return rates and equipment sale price at lease maturity. Inputs include historical return rates and realized sales values (see Note 5).\nProperty and equipment\n– net\n– The impairments are measured at the lower of the carrying amount, or fair value. The valuations were based on cost and market approaches. The inputs include replacement cost estimates adjusted for physical deterioration and economic obsolescence, or quoted prices when available (see Note 5).\nInvestment in unconsolidated affiliates –\nOther than temporary impairments for investments are measured as the difference between the implied fair value or the estimated realization amount, and the carrying value. The fair value for publicly traded entities is the share price multiplied by the shares owned, or the estimated realization amount (see Note 5).\nOther intangible assets – net\n– The impairment was measured at the remaining net book value of customer relationships related to a closed factory operation (see Note 5).\nOther assets\n–\nThe impairments of the matured operating lease inventory were measured at the fair value of that equipment. The valuations were based on a market approach. The inputs include sales of comparable assets. The impairment of the German lawn\n79\n​\nmower business was measured at the estimated realizable value. Fair value was based on estimates of the final sale price (see Note 5).\n27. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nCash Flow Hedges\nCertain interest rate and cross-currency interest rate contracts (swaps) were designated as hedges of future cash flows from borrowings. The total notional amounts of the receive-variable/pay-fixed interest rate contracts at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 were $\n2,700\nmillion and $\n1,550\nmillion, respectively. During 2019, the company hedged a portion of its exposure to interest rate changes on a forecasted debt issuance using an interest rate contract with a term of\n30 years\n. The hedge was terminated upon issuance of the debt, resulting in a fair value loss of $\n70\nmillion. Fair value gains or losses on cash flow hedges were recorded in OCI and are subsequently reclassified into interest expense or other operating expenses (foreign currency exchange) in the same periods during which the hedged transactions impact earnings. These amounts offset the effects of interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate changes on the related borrowings. The cash flows from these contracts were recorded in operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows.\nThe amount of loss recorded in OCI at October 31, 2021 that is expected to be reclassified to interest expense or other operating expenses in the next twelve months if interest rates or exchange rates remain unchanged is approximately\n$\n4\nmillion after-tax. There were\nno\ngains or losses reclassified from OCI to earnings based on the probability that the original forecasted transaction would not occur.\nFair Value Hedges\nCertain interest rate contracts (swaps) were designated as fair value hedges of borrowings. The total notional amounts of the receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate contracts at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 were $\n8,043\nmillion and $\n7,239\nmillion, respectively. The fair value gains or losses on these contracts were generally offset by fair value gains or losses on the hedged items (fixed-rate borrowings) with both items recorded in interest expense.\nThe amounts recorded, at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, in the consolidated balance sheet related to borrowings designated in fair value hedging relationships in millions of dollars follow:\n​\n*    Presented in short-term borrowings\n.\n​\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nThe company has certain interest rate contracts (swaps), foreign currency exchange contracts (futures, forwards, and swaps), and cross-currency interest rate contracts (swaps), which were not formally designated as hedges. These derivatives were held as economic hedges for underlying interest rate or foreign currency exposures primarily for certain borrowings, purchases or sales of inventory, and below market retail financing programs. The total notional amounts of the interest rate swaps at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 were $\n10,848\nmillion and $\n8,514\nmillion, the foreign currency exchange contracts were $\n7,584\nmillion and $\n4,903\nmillion, and the cross-currency interest rate contracts were $\n238\nmillion and $\n113\nmillion, respectively. The fair value gains or losses from the interest rate contracts were recognized currently in interest expense and the gains or losses from foreign currency exchange contracts in cost of sales or other operating expenses, generally offsetting over time the expenses on the exposures being hedged. The cash flows from these non-designated contracts were recorded in operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows.\n80\n​\nFair values of derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheet at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 in millions of dollars follow:\n​\n​\nThe classification and gains (losses) including accrued interest expense related to derivative instruments on the statement of consolidated income consisted of the following in millions of dollars:\n​\n*\nIncludes interest and foreign exchange gains (losses) from cross-currency\ninterest rate contracts.\n​\nCounterparty Risk and Collateral\nDerivative instruments are subject to significant concentrations of credit risk to the banking sector. The company manages individual counterparty exposure by setting limits that consider the credit rating of the counterparty, the credit default swap spread of the counterparty, and other financial commitments and exposures between the company and the counterparty banks. All interest rate derivatives are transacted under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation. Some of these agreements include credit support provisions. Each master\nagreement permits the net settlement of amounts owed in the event of default or termination.\nCertain of the company’s derivative agreements contain credit support provisions that may require the company to post collateral based on the size of the net liability positions and credit ratings. The aggregate fair value of all derivatives with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, was $\n135\nmillion and $\n89\nmillion, respectively. In accordance with the limits established in these agreements, the company posted\nno\ncash collateral at October 31, 2021 or November 1, 2020. In addition, the company paid $\n8\nmillion of collateral either in cash or pledged securities that was outstanding at both October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 to participate in an international futures market to hedge currency exposure, not included in the table below.\nDerivatives are recorded without offsetting for netting arrangements or collateral.\nThe impact on the derivative assets and liabilities related to netting arrangements and collateral at October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020 in millions of dollars follows:\n​\n​\n​\n28. SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA\nIn fiscal year 2021, the company implemented a new operating model and reporting structure. With this change, the company’s agriculture and turf operations were divided into two new segments: production and precision agriculture and small agriculture and turf. There were no changes to the construction and forestry and financial services segments. This presentation is consistent with how the chief operating decision maker assesses the performance of the segments and makes decisions about resource allocations. The company’s operations are presently organized and reported in\nfour\nbusiness segments described as follows:\nThe production and precision agriculture segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for production-scale growers of large grains, small grains, cotton, and sugar. Main products include large and certain mid-size tractors, combines, cotton pickers, sugarcane harvesters and loaders, and soil preparation, seeding, application and crop care equipment.\nThe small agriculture and turf segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for dairy and livestock producers, high-value crop producers, and turf and utility customers. The segment’s primary products include certain mid-size and small tractors, as well as hay and forage equipment, riding and commercial lawn equipment, golf course equipment, and utility vehicles.\n81\n​\nThe construction and forestry segment defines, develops, and delivers a broad range of machines and technology solutions organized along the earthmoving, forestry, and roadbuilding production systems. The segment’s primary products include crawler dozers and loaders, four-wheel-drive loaders, excavators, skid-steer loaders, milling machines, and log harvesters.\nThe products and services produced by the segments above are marketed primarily through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets, and, as it relates to roadbuilding products in certain markets outside the U.S. and Canada, primarily through company-owned sales and service subsidiaries.\nThe financial services segment primarily finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used production and precision agriculture equipment, small agriculture and turf equipment, and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, finances retail revolving charge accounts, and offers extended equipment warranties.\nBecause of integrated manufacturing operations and common administrative and marketing support, a substantial number of allocations must be made to determine operating segment and geographic area data. Intersegment sales and revenues represent sales of components and finance charges, which are generally based on market prices.\nAt the beginning of fiscal year 2021, the company reclassified goodwill from identifiable operating segment assets to corporate assets for segment reporting, as goodwill is no longer considered in evaluating the operating performance of the segments. Prior period amounts have been restated for a consistent presentation.\nInformation relating to operations by operating segment in millions of dollars follows for the years ended October 31, 2021, November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019. In addition to the following unaffiliated sales and revenues by segment, intersegment sales and revenues in 2021, 2020, and 2019 were as follows: production and precision agriculture net sales of\n$\n27\nmillion,\n$\n22\nmillion, and\n$\n31\nmillion; small agriculture and turf net sales of\n$\n11\nmillion,\n$\n2\nmillion, and\n$\n3\nmillion; construction and forestry had\nno\nintersegment sales in 2021,\n$\n1\nmillion in 2020, and\n$\n1\nmillion in 2019; and financial services revenues of\n$\n246\nmillion,\n$\n278\nmillion, and\n$\n348\nmillion, respectively.\n​\n*\nOther revenues are primarily the equipment operations’ revenues for finance and interest income, and other income.\n​\n​\n​\n*\nOperating profit of the financial services business segment includes the effect of its interest expense and foreign exchange gains or losses.\n​\n*\nDoes not include finance rental income for equipment on operating leases.\n​\n*\nIncludes depreciation for equipment on operating leases.\n​\n(continued)\n82\n​\n​\n*\nCorporate assets are primarily the equipment operations’ retirement benefits, deferred income tax assets, goodwill, marketable securities, and cash and cash equivalents.\n​\n​\n​\nThe company views and has historically disclosed its operations as consisting of two geographic areas (the U.S. and Canada, and outside the U.S. and Canada) for net sales and revenues and operating profit shown below in millions of dollars. No individual foreign country’s net sales and revenues were material for disclosure purposes. For property and equipment, a material amount does reside in the country of Germany, separately disclosed below in millions of dollars.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n29. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nIn November 2021, the company renewed its outstanding bank conduit facility revolving credit agreement, which reduced the facility capacity from $\n2,000\nmillion to $\n1,000\nmillion. As a result of the facility renewal at a reduced capacity, the company repurchased $\n511\nmillion of outstanding short-term securitization borrowings in November 2021, in addition to the normal monthly collection of payments on the retail notes.\nOn November 17, 2021, employees represented by the UAW approved a new collective bargaining agreement and terminated a strike that began on October 14, 2021. The agreement, which has a term of\nsix years\n, covers the wages, hours, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment for the company’s UAW-represented employees at\n14\nU.S. facilities. The labor agreement includes a lump sum ratification bonus payment of $\n8,500\nper eligible employee, totaling $\n90\nmillion, and an immediate wage increase of\n10\npercent plus further wage increases over the term of the contract. The lump sum payment will be expensed in the first quarter of 2022. The company remeasured the U.S. hourly pension plan as of November 30, 2021 due to the new collective bargaining agreement, which decreased the plan’s funded status by approximately $\n495\nmillion and will increase pension expense in 2022 by nearly $\n80\nmillion. The U.S. hourly pension plan changes will continue to impact pension expense through the remaining term of the contract as well as years beyond the current contract as employees continue to accumulate years of service. The UAW strike is expected to have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations for the three months ending January 30, 2022 as a result of reduced production and shipments.\nOn November 30, 2021, the company voluntarily contributed $\n1,000\nmillion to a U.S. OPEB plan. The expected return on this contribution was included in the 2022 pension and OPEB cost estimates in the MD&A.\nA quarterly dividend of $\n1.05\nper share was declared at the Board of Directors meeting on December 8, 2021, payable on February 8, 2022 to stockholders of record on December 31, 2021.\nOn December 14, 2021, the company announced a definitive agreement to acquire majority ownership in Kreisel Electric, Inc. (Kreisel), a battery technology provider based in Austria. Kreisel has differentiated battery technology for high-performance and off-highway applications as well as charging infrastructure offerings globally and across multiple end markets. This will provide Deere with the high-density battery technology necessary to optimally integrate and efficiently design vehicles and power trains while leveraging Kreisel’s charging technology to build out infrastructure to enable global customer adoption. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of fiscal year 2022, subject to the receipt of certain required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions. Total cash consideration will be €\n221\nmillion and paid out of cash on hand. Kreisel will be allocated amongst the company’s production and precision agriculture, small agriculture and turf, and construction and forestry segments.\n​\n​\n​\n83\nDEERE & COMPANY\nSELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\n(Dollars in millions except per share amounts)\n*     Attributable to Deere & Company\n.\n​\n​\n84\n​\n​\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Deere & Company:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Deere & Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, the related statements of consolidated income, consolidated comprehensive income, changes in consolidated stockholders' equity, and consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2021 and November 1, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated December 16, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nSales Incentives — Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe sales incentive accrual at October 31, 2021 was $1,680 million, of which $880 million is recorded within trade accounts and notes receivable – net and $800 million is recorded within accounts payable and accrued expenses. At the time a sale to a dealer is recognized, the Company records an estimate of the future sales incentive costs as a reduction to the sales price. These incentives may be based on a dealer’s purchase volume, or on retail sales incentive programs for allowances and financing programs that will be due when the dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. The estimated cost of these programs is based on historical data, announced and expected incentive programs, field inventory levels and forecasted sales volumes. The final cost of these programs is determined at the end of the measurement period for volume-based incentives or when the dealer sells the equipment to the retail customer. This is due to numerous programs available at any particular time and new programs that may be announced after the Company records the equipment sale. Changes in the mix and types of programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly. The estimation of the sales incentive accrual is impacted by many assumptions. One of the key assumptions is the predictive value of the historical percentage of sales incentive costs to retail sales from dealers.\nWe identified the sales incentive accrual as a critical audit matter because estimating sales incentive costs requires significant judgment by management and changes in historical percentage of sales incentive costs to retails sales by dealers could have a material impact on the sales incentive accrual. Auditing management’s assumptions about the predictive nature of historical sales incentive costs involves a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates.\n​\n​\n85\n​\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to testing management’s assumption that historical sales incentive costs are predictive of future incentive costs included the following, among others:\nAllowance for Credit Losses – Refer to Notes 2 and 13 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe allowance for credit losses as of October 31, 2021 was $207 million. The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of the Company’s receivable portfolio. The Company measures expected credit losses on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Risk characteristics considered by the Company include finance product category, market, geography, credit risk, and remaining duration. The Company utilizes loss forecast models, which are selected based on the size and credit risk of the underlying pool of receivables, to estimate expected credit losses. Transition matrix models are used for large and complex retail customer receivable pools. The modeled expected credit losses are adjusted based on reasonable and supportable forecasts, which may include economic indicators such as commodity prices, industry equipment sales, unemployment rates, and housing starts. Management reviews each model’s output quarterly, and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary.\nWe identified the allowance for credit losses as a critical audit matter because determining the appropriate methodology and assumptions used in the estimate requires significant judgment by management. Given the subjective nature and judgment applied by management to determine the allowance for credit losses, auditing the methodology and assumptions requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve credit specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to testing the Company’s allowance for credit losses included the following, among others:\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nDecember 16, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1910.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n86\n​\n​\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Deere & Company:\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Deere & Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of October 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended October 31, 2021 of the Company and our report dated December 16, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nDecember 16, 2021\n​\n​\n87\n​\n​\n​\n​\nIndex to Exhibits\n88\n89\n90\n​\n​\n​\n​\n91\n​\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\nDate: December 16, 2021\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the registrant and in the capacities and on the date indicated.\nEach person signing below also hereby appoints John C.
