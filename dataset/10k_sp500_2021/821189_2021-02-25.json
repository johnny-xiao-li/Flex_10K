    "text": "General\nEOG Resources, Inc., a Delaware corporation organized in 1985, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), explores for, develops, produces and markets crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas primarily in major producing basins in the United States of America (United States or U.S.), The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (Trinidad), The People's Republic of China (China), the Sultanate of Oman (Oman) and, from time to time, select other international areas.  EOG's principal producing areas are further described in \"Exploration and Production\" below.  EOG's Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10‑Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports (including related exhibits and supplemental schedules) filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended) are made available, free of charge, through EOG's website, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports have been filed with, or furnished to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  EOG's website address is www.eogresources.com.  Information on our website is not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute a part of, this report.\nAt December 31, 2020, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 3,220 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), of which 1,514 million barrels (MMBbl) were crude oil and condensate reserves, 813 MMBbl were NGLs reserves and 5,360 billion cubic feet (Bcf), or 893 MMBoe, were natural gas reserves (see \"Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements\").  At such date, approximately 98% of EOG's net proved reserves, on a crude oil equivalent basis, were located in the United States, 1% in Trinidad and 1% in other international areas.  Crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas.\nEOG's operations are all crude oil and natural gas exploration and production related.  For information regarding the risks associated with EOG's domestic and foreign operations, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.\nEOG's business strategy is to maximize the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries.  Pursuant to this strategy, each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return.  This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term growth in shareholder value and maintain a strong balance sheet.  EOG is focused on innovation and cost-effective utilization of advanced technology associated with three-dimensional seismic and microseismic data, the development of reservoir simulation models, the use of improved drilling equipment and completion technologies for horizontal drilling and formation evaluation.  These advanced technologies are used, as appropriate, throughout EOG to reduce the risks and costs associated with all aspects of oil and gas exploration, development and exploitation.  EOG implements its strategy primarily by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves.  Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure, coupled with efficient and safe operations and robust environmental stewardship practices and performance, is integral in the implementation of EOG's strategy.\nWith respect to information on EOG's working interest in wells or acreage, \"net\" oil and gas wells or acreage are determined by multiplying \"gross\" oil and gas wells or acreage by EOG's working interest in the wells or acreage.\nExploration and Production\nUnited States Operations\nEOG's operations are located in most of the productive basins in the United States with a focus on crude oil and, to a lesser extent, liquids-rich natural gas plays.\nAt December 31, 2020, on a crude oil equivalent basis, 48% of EOG's net proved reserves in the United States were crude oil and condensate, 26% were NGLs and 26% were natural gas.  The majority of these reserves are in long-lived fields with well-established production characteristics.  EOG believes that opportunities exist to increase production through continued development in and around many of these fields and through the utilization of applicable technologies.  EOG also maintains an active exploration program designed to extend fields and add new trends and resource plays to its already broad portfolio.\n1\nThe following is a summary of significant developments during 2020 and anticipated 2021 plans for certain areas of EOG's United States operations.\n(1)\nThousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.\nThe South Texas area includes our Eagle Ford play and our newly announced Dorado gas play.\nEOG holds approximately 516,000 total net acres in the prolific oil window of the Eagle Ford and approximately 163,000 net acres in the Dorado prospect area.\nDuring the second and third quarters of 2020, EOG significantly curtailed its Eagle Ford oil production due to low crude oil prices; operations in the Eagle Ford returned to normal by the end of the third quarter of 2020.\nIn the Dorado play, with the onset of the pandemic and resulting market downturn, EOG elected to defer its 2020 drilling program and instead focus on gathering and analyzing data regarding the production performance of its 2019 Dorado drilling program.\nIn 2020, EOG completed 213 net Eagle Ford wells and, late in 2020, acquired and completed one net Dorado well to further delineate the play.\nIn 2021, EOG expects to complete approximately 145 net Eagle Ford wells and to drill and complete approximately 15 net Dorado wells.\nIn the Delaware Basin, EOG completed 247 net wells during 2020, primarily in the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp, Bone Spring and Leonard plays.  The Delaware Basin consists of approximately 4,800 feet of oil rich stacked pay potential offering EOG multiple co-development opportunities throughout its 404,000 total net acreage position.\nIn the Delaware Basin Upper Wolfcamp play, EOG has approximately 226,000 net acres and completed 166 net wells in 2020.  EOG continued its Upper Wolfcamp development plan with well spacing as close as 500 feet in the crude oil portion of the play and 880 feet in the combination crude oil and natural gas portion.  In addition to the Upper Wolfcamp, EOG completed 7 net wells in 2020 in the newly announced Middle Wolfcamp play and has identified 193,000 net prospective acres.  Continued improvement and excellent results in the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp program were supported by optimized well spacing, enhanced well completions, precision drilling and continued cost reductions.  Moving forward into 2021, the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp play will continue to be a primary area of focus.\nIn the Bone Spring play, EOG has three main sub-plays: the First, Second and Third Bone Spring.  In 2020, EOG completed 56 total net Bone Spring wells within the three sub-plays on its combined 289,000 net prospective acres.  Of the three sub-plays, the Second Bone Spring had the majority of the activity in 2020 with EOG completing 42 net wells.  The Bone Spring plays continue to be an integral part of EOG’s Delaware Basin plans and portfolio.\nIn the Leonard play, EOG holds approximately 160,000 net acres and maintained its development plan with 18 net wells completed in 2020.  With a strategy of developing deeper targets first while simultaneously collecting data from the shallow targets, the Leonard play will progressively become a more active part of EOG’s program.\nActivity in 2021 will remain focused on the Delaware Basin Wolfcamp, Bone Spring, and Leonard plays, where EOG expects to complete approximately 275 net wells.\n2\nActivity in the Rocky Mountain area in 2020 was focused on the Wyoming Powder River Basin.  In the Powder River Basin, EOG operated a one-rig program and completed 35 net wells in the Niobrara, Mowry, Turner and Parkman formations.  In addition, key infrastructure was added in order to lower operating costs and increase price realizations going forward.  In the DJ Basin, EOG operated one rig for a partial year and completed 17 net wells in both the Codell and the Niobrara formations.  Activity in the DJ Basin is expected to be minimal in 2021 as development continues to shift to the Powder River Basin.  In the Williston Basin, EOG completed 3 net wells in the Bakken and Three Forks.  In 2020, production in the Rocky Mountain area and Williston Basin was significantly curtailed, primarily in the second quarter, in response to crude oil price declines, but has subsequently returned to normal levels.  In 2021, activity will be focused on development in the Powder River Basin with plans to complete approximately 45 net wells. EOG currently holds approximately 1.2 million net acres in the Rocky Mountain area.\nIn the Mid-Continent area, EOG continued its development of the Woodford Oil Window play with 15 net wells completed during 2020.  EOG holds approximately 37,000 net acres in the play and plans to have minimal activity in 2021.\nOperations Outside the United States\nEOG has operations offshore Trinidad, in the China Sichuan Basin, Oman and in Canada and is evaluating additional exploration, development and exploitation opportunities in these and other select international areas.\nTrinidad.\nEOG, through its subsidiaries, including EOG Resources Trinidad Limited, holds interests in (i) the exploration and production licenses covering the South East Coast Consortium (SECC) Block, Pelican and Banyan Fields, Sercan Area and each of their related facilities and the Ska, Mento, Reggae and deep Teak, Saaman and Poui Areas, all of which are offshore Trinidad; and (ii) a production sharing contract with the Government of Trinidad and Tobago for each of the Modified U(a), Modified U(b) and 4(a) Blocks.\nSeveral fields in the SECC, Modified U(a), Modified U(b) and 4(a) Blocks, Banyan Field and Sercan Area have been developed and are producing natural gas and crude oil and condensate.\nIn 2020, EOG's net production averaged approximately 180 MMcfd of natural gas and approximately 1.0 MBbld of crude oil and condensate.  In 2020, EOG drilled three net wells and completed two net wells.  The remaining net well made a discovery that is being evaluated.  All wells discovered commercially economic reserves.\nIn 2021, EOG expects to focus on the design and fabrication of the platform and related infrastructure for the previously announced discovery made in the Modified U(a) Block.  In addition, EOG expects to continue its exploration program.\nChina\n.  Since 2008, EOG has been developing the Baijaochang Field in the Chuan Zhong Block exploration area in the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China with its partner, PetroChina, under a production sharing contract.  In 2020, EOG's net production averaged approximately 26 MMcfd of natural gas.  EOG continues to work with PetroChina to ensure uninterrupted production.\nOman\n.  In September 2020, EOG reached an agreement with APEX Oman (Block 36) Inc. to acquire its entire interest in Block 36 in Oman.  The Royal Decree was issued on October 28, 2020 at which point EOG became the operator and held all rights under the Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement for Block 36.  Additionally, in December 2020 the Ministry of Energy and Minerals for Oman approved the assignment of Block 49 to EOG pursuant to the terms of the farm-in agreement with Tethys Oil Montasar Limited. In accordance with the terms of the farm-in agreement EOG participated in the drilling of an exploratory well which was in progress at December 31, 2020.  In 2021, EOG expects to drill two net exploration wells in Block 36.\nCanada.\nEOG maintains approximately 47,000 net acres in the Horn River area in Northeast British Columbia.  In March 2020, EOG began the process of exiting its Canada operations.\n3\nMarketing\nIn 2020, EOG continued its diversified approach to marketing its wellhead crude oil and condensate production.  The majority of EOG's United States wellhead crude oil and condensate production was transported by pipeline to downstream markets with the remainder sold into local markets.  Major U.S. sales areas accessed by EOG were at various locations along the U.S. Gulf Coast, including Houston and Corpus Christi, Texas; Cushing, Oklahoma; the Permian Basin and the Midwest.  In 2020, EOG also sold crude oil at the Houston Ship Channel and the Port of Corpus Christi for export to foreign destinations.  In each case, the price received was based on market prices at that specific sales point or based on the price index applicable for that location.  In 2021, the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same.  At December 31, 2020, EOG was committed to deliver to multiple parties fixed quantities of crude oil of 8 MMBbls in 2021, all of which is expected to be delivered from future production of available reserves.\nIn 2020, EOG processed certain of its United States wellhead natural gas production, either at EOG-owned facilities or at third-party facilities, extracting NGLs.  NGLs were sold at prevailing market prices, into either local markets or downstream locations.  In certain instances, EOG exchanged its NGL production for purity products received downstream, which were sold at prevailing market prices.  In 2021, such pricing mechanisms are expected to remain the same.\nIn 2020, consistent with its diversified marketing strategy, the majority of EOG's United States wellhead natural gas production was transported by pipeline to various locations, including Katy, Texas; East Texas; the Agua Dulce Hub in South Texas; the Cheyenne Hub in Weld County, Colorado; Southern California; and Chicago, Illinois.  Remaining natural gas production was sold into local markets.  In each case, pricing was based on the spot market price at the ultimate sales point.  In 2021, the pricing mechanism for such production is expected to remain the same.  Additionally, EOG sells natural gas to a liquefied natural gas liquefaction facility near Corpus Christi, Texas, and receives pricing based on the Platts Japan Korea Marker.  At December 31, 2020, EOG was committed to deliver to multiple parties fixed quantities of natural gas of 170 Bcf in 2021, 105 Bcf in 2022, 91 Bcf in 2023, 94 Bcf in 2024, 81 Bcf in 2025 and 1,609 Bcf thereafter, all of which is expected to be delivered from future production of available reserves.\nIn 2020, a majority of the wellhead natural gas volumes from Trinidad were sold under contracts with prices which were either wholly or partially dependent on Caribbean ammonia index prices and/or methanol prices.  The remaining volumes were sold under a contract at prices partially dependent on United States Henry Hub market prices or under a fixed price contract.  In 2021, natural gas volumes from Trinidad will be sold under a fixed price contract ending in 2026.\nIn 2020, all wellhead natural gas volumes from China were sold at regulated prices based on the purchaser's pipeline sales volumes to various local market segments.  The pricing mechanism for production in China is expected to remain the same in 2021.\nIn certain instances, EOG purchases and sells third-party crude oil and natural gas in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities.\n4\nDuring 2020, three purchasers each accounted for more than 10% of EOG's total wellhead crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas revenues and gathering, processing and marketing revenues.  The three purchasers are in the crude oil refining industry.  EOG does not believe that the loss of any single purchaser would have a materially adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.\nWellhead Volumes and Prices\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding EOG's wellhead volumes of, and average prices for, crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas.  The table also presents crude oil equivalent volumes which are determined using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 Mcf of natural gas for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.  See ITEM 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations, for wellhead volumes on a per-day basis.\n5\n(1)\nMillion barrels or billion cubic feet, as applicable.\n(2)\nOther International includes EOG's United Kingdom, China and Canada operations.  The United Kingdom operations were sold in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n(3)\nMillion barrels of oil equivalent; includes crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas.\n(4)\nDollars per barrel or per thousand cubic feet, as applicable.  Excludes the impact of financial commodity derivative instruments (see Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of December 31, 2020, EOG employed approximately 2,900 persons, including foreign national employees.\nEOG's approach to human capital management includes oversight by the Board of Directors and Compensation Committee and focuses on various areas, including the following:\nCulture; Recruiting; Retention.\nEOG's unique culture is key to its sustainable success.  By providing employees with a quality environment in which to work, and by maintaining a consistent college recruiting and internship program, EOG is able to attract and retain some of the industry's best and brightest.\nTo help assess the effectiveness of its approach to human capital management, EOG conducts an annual employee engagement survey.\nBased on the results of the survey, EOG has received \"top workplace\" recognition in various office locations.\nCompensation, Benefits, Health & Wellness\n.  EOG places a high level of importance on attracting and retaining top talent, by providing competitive salaries, bonuses and a subsidized, comprehensive benefits package.\nEOG also offers a holistic wellness program, a matching gifts program, a flexible work schedule, paid family care leave, paid leave for illness or injury and an employee assistance program to support the mental well-being of employees and their dependents.  In addition, with new-hire stock grants and an annual stock grant program, every employee is a participant in EOG's success.\nIn 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, EOG focused on keeping its employees and their families safe, including providing technology and support to employees enabling them to work productively from home.  In addition, at its offices and work sites, EOG has instituted social distancing practices and protocols and has provided masks, hand sanitizer and additional cleaning.\nTraining and Development\n.  EOG provides training in leadership, management skills, communication, team effectiveness, technical skills and development and use of EOG systems and applications.  EOG's leadership training is focused on providing continuity of leadership at EOG by developing the skills needed to lead a multi-disciplined, diverse and decentralized workforce.  In addition, EOG holds several internal technical conferences each year designed to share best practices and technical advances across the company, including safety and environmental topics.  EOG also offers its employees a tuition reimbursement program as well as reimbursement for the cost of professional certification.\n6\nDiversity and Inclusion\n.  Gender, racial, ethnic and cultural diversity, and diversity in background and experience, leads to diversity of thought, which is a tremendous asset and is actively embraced by EOG.  As reflected in its Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Directors, Officers and Employees, EOG is committed to providing equal opportunity in all aspects of employment and to hiring, evaluating and promoting employees based on skills and performance.  EOG's collaborative culture fosters inclusiveness at all levels of the company.  Further, EOG focuses on developing its employees, including those with diverse backgrounds, to allow for career opportunities, including promotion into supervisory and management positions.\nSafety\n.  EOG's safety management programs and processes are centered on a performance-based philosophy, pursuant to which EOG sets safety expectations and provides a framework within which management can achieve and assess safety performance in a systematic way.  EOG's safety performance is also considered in evaluating employee performance and compensation.  EOG provides initial, periodic and refresher safety training to employees as well as to contractors and others who may work at or visit EOG's facilities.  These training programs address various topics, including operating procedures, safe work practices and emergency and incident response procedures.\nCompetition\nEOG competes with major integrated oil and gas companies, government-affiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases, properties and reserves and access to the facilities, equipment, materials, services, and employees and other personnel (including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other specialists) required to explore for, develop, produce, market and transport crude oil, NGLs and natural gas.  Certain of EOG's competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those EOG possesses and have established strategic long-term positions or strong governmental relationships in countries or areas in which EOG may seek new or expanded entry.  As a consequence, EOG may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects, such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services, facilities, equipment, materials and personnel.  In addition, EOG's larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels.  EOG also faces competition from competing energy sources, such as renewable energy sources.  See ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.\nRegulation\n2020 Election\n.  In November 2020, Joseph R. Biden Jr. was elected President of the United States.  New or revised rules, regulations and policies may be issued, and new legislation may be proposed, during the current administration that could impact the oil and gas exploration and production industry.  Such rules, regulations, policies and legislation may affect, among other things, (i) permitting for oil and gas drilling on federal lands, (ii) the leasing of federal lands for oil and gas development, (iii) the regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and/or other climate change-related matters associated with oil and gas operations, (iv) the use of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands, (v) the calculation of royalty payments in respect of oil and gas production from federal lands and (vi) U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to oil and gas exploration and production companies.  See the below discussion and ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information.\nUnited States Regulation of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production.\nCrude oil and natural gas production operations are subject to various types of regulation, including regulation by federal and state agencies.\nUnited States legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion.\nIn addition, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue, and have issued, rules and regulations applicable to the oil and gas industry.\nSuch rules and regulations, among other things, require permits for the drilling of wells, regulate the spacing of wells, prevent the waste of natural gas through restrictions on flaring, require surety bonds for various exploration and production operations and regulate the calculation and disbursement of royalty payments (for federal and state leases), production taxes and ad valorem taxes.\nA portion of EOG's oil and gas leases in New Mexico, North Dakota, Utah, Wyoming and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as in other areas, are granted by the federal government and administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and/or the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) or, in the case of offshore leases (which, for EOG, are de minimis), by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), all federal agencies.\nOperations conducted by EOG on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous additional statutory and regulatory restrictions and, in the case of leases relating to tribal lands, certain tribal environmental and permitting requirements and employment rights regulations.\nIn addition, the U.S. Department of the Interior (via various of its agencies, including the BLM, the BIA and the Office of Natural Resources Revenue) has certain authority over our calculation and payment of royalties, bonuses, fines, penalties, assessments and other revenues related to our federal and tribal oil and gas leases.\n7\nBLM, BIA and BOEM leases contain relatively standardized terms requiring compliance with detailed regulations and, in the case of offshore leases, orders pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (which are subject to change by the BOEM or BSEE).\nUnder certain circumstances, the BLM, BIA, BOEM or BSEE (as applicable) may require operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated.\nAny such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect EOG's interests on federal lands.  Further, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14008 entitled \"Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,\" directing the Secretary of the Interior, to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders, to, among other things, pause approval of new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices.  Any limitation or ban on permitting for oil and gas exploration and production activities on federal lands could have a material and adverse effect on EOG's operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938, as amended (NGA), and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.  These statutes are administered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).  Effective January 1993, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989 deregulated natural gas prices for all \"first sales\" of natural gas, which includes all sales by EOG of its own production.  All other sales of natural gas by EOG, such as those of natural gas purchased from third parties, remain jurisdictional sales subject to a blanket sales certificate under the NGA, which has flexible terms and conditions.  Consequently, all of EOG's sales of natural gas currently may be made at market prices, subject to applicable contract provisions.  EOG's jurisdictional sales, however, may be subject in the future to greater federal oversight, including the possibility that the FERC might prospectively impose more restrictive conditions on such sales.  Conversely, sales of crude oil and condensate and NGLs by EOG are made at unregulated market prices.\nEOG owns certain gathering and/or processing facilities in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale in North Texas, the Williston Basin Bakken and Three Forks plays in North Dakota, and the Eagle Ford in South Texas.\nState regulation of gathering and processing facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscrimination requirements with respect to the provision of gathering and processing services, but does not generally entail rate regulation.\nEOG's gathering and processing operations could be materially and adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services.\nEOG's gathering and processing operations also may be, or become, subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of such facilities.\nAdditional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered and/or adopted from time to time.\nAlthough EOG cannot predict what effect, if any, such legislation might have on its operations and financial condition, EOG could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance and operating costs depending on the nature and extent of such future legislative and regulatory changes.\nEOG also owns crude oil rail loading facilities in North Dakota and crude oil truck unloading facilities in certain of its U.S. plays.\nRegulation of such facilities is conducted at the state and federal levels and generally includes various safety, environmental, permitting and packaging/labeling requirements.\nAdditional regulation pertaining to these matters is considered and/or adopted from time to time.\nAlthough EOG cannot predict what effect, if any, any such new regulations might have on its crude-by-rail assets and the transportation of its crude oil production by truck, EOG could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased compliance and operating costs depending on the nature and extent of such future regulatory changes.\nEOG did not transport any crude oil by rail during 2020.\nProposals and proceedings that might affect the oil and gas industry are considered from time to time by Congress, the state legislatures, the FERC and other federal, state and local regulatory commissions, agencies, councils and courts.\nEOG cannot predict when or whether any such proposals or proceedings may become effective.\nIt should also be noted that the oil and gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, there is no assurance that the approach currently being followed by such legislative bodies and regulatory commissions, agencies, councils and courts will remain unchanged.\nEnvironmental Regulation Generally - United States.\nEOG is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.\nThese laws and regulations affect EOG's operations and costs as a result of their effect on crude oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements.\n8\nIn addition, EOG has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under EOG's control.  Under environmental laws and regulations, EOG could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators.  EOG also could incur costs related to the clean-up of third-party sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning, and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such third-party sites.  In addition, EOG could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which EOG previously owned or currently owns an interest, but was or is not the operator.  Moreover, EOG is subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA) rule requiring annual reporting of GHG emissions and, as discussed further below, is also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing and other aspects of our operations.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations increases EOG's overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on EOG's operations, financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, it is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that EOG will be required in the near future to expend amounts (whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise) that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations.  However, given that such laws and regulations are subject to change, EOG is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on EOG's operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate Change - United States.\nLocal, state, federal and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on GHG emissions and climate change issues in recent years.  In addition to the U.S. EPA's rule requiring annual reporting of GHG emissions, the U.S. EPA has adopted regulations for certain large sources regulating GHG emissions as pollutants under the federal Clean Air Act.  Further, the U.S. EPA, in May 2016, issued regulations that require operators to reduce methane emissions and emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from new, modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations, gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations.  In September 2020, the U.S. EPA issued a final rule that removed the transmission and storage segment from the 2016 new source performance standards, rescinded VOC and methane emissions standards for the transmission and storage segment and rescinded methane emissions standards for the production and processing segments.  Various states and industry and environmental groups are separately challenging the U.S. EPA's 2016 standards and its September 2020 final rule. Notwithstanding the current court challenges, the U.S. EPA under the Biden Administration may reconsider the September 2020 final rule, which could result in more stringent methane emission rulemaking.\nAt the international level, the U.S., in December 2015, participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France.  The Paris Agreement (adopted at the conference) calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and GHG emissions.  The Paris Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016.  While the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020, President Biden issued an executive order on January 20, 2021 recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement.  In addition, many state and local officials have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord.  Further, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14008 entitled \"Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,\" directing the Secretary of the Interior, to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders, to, among other things, consider whether to adjust royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from federal lands and offshore waters to account for corresponding climate costs.\nEOG believes that its strategy to reduce GHG emissions throughout its operations is both in the best interest of the environment and a prudent business practice.  EOG has developed a system that is utilized in calculating GHG emissions from its operating facilities.  This emissions management system calculates emissions based on recognized regulatory methodologies, where applicable, and on commonly accepted engineering practices.  EOG reports GHG emissions for facilities covered under the U.S. EPA's Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule published in 2009, as amended.\nEOG is unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations, laws, regulations, treaties or policies regarding climate change and GHG emissions (including any laws and regulations that may be enacted in the U.S. by the new administration), but the direct and indirect costs of such developments (if enacted, issued or applied) could materially and adversely affect EOG's operations, financial condition and results of operations.  Further, the increasing attention to global climate change risks has created the potential for a greater likelihood of governmental investigations and private and public litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\n9\nRegulation of Hydraulic Fracturing and Other Operations - United States.\nSubstantially all of the onshore crude oil and natural gas wells drilled by EOG are completed and stimulated through the use of hydraulic fracturing.  Hydraulic fracturing technology, which has been used by the oil and gas industry for more than 60 years and is constantly being enhanced, enables EOG to produce crude oil and natural gas that otherwise would not be recovered.\nSpecifically, hydraulic fracturing is a process in which pressurized fluid is pumped into underground formations to create tiny fractures or spaces that allow crude oil and natural gas to flow from the reservoir into the well so that it can be brought to the surface.\nHydraulic fracturing generally takes place thousands of feet underground, a considerable distance below any drinking water aquifers, and there are impermeable layers of rock between the area fractured and the water aquifers.\nThe makeup of the fluid used in the hydraulic fracturing process typically includes water and sand, and less than 1% of highly diluted chemical additives; lists of the chemical additives used in fracturing fluids are available to the public via internet websites and in other publications sponsored by industry trade associations and through state agencies in those states that require the reporting of the components of fracturing fluids.\nWhile the majority of the sand remains underground to hold open the fractures, a significant amount of the water and chemical additives flow back and are then either reused or safely disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by the appropriate regulatory authorities.  EOG periodically conducts regulatory assessments of these disposal facilities to monitor compliance with applicable regulations.\nThe regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements.  In April 2012, however, the U.S. EPA issued regulations specifically applicable to the oil and gas industry that require operators to significantly reduce VOC emissions from natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured through the use of \"green completions\" to capture natural gas that would otherwise escape into the air.  The U.S. EPA has also issued regulations that establish standards for VOC emissions from several types of equipment, including storage tanks, compressors, dehydrators, and valves and sweetening units at gas processing plants.  In addition, in May 2016, the U.S. EPA issued regulations that require operators to reduce methane and VOC emissions from new, modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations, gas processing plants and natural gas transmission compressor stations. In September 2020, the U.S. EPA issued amendments to the 2012 and 2016 new source performance standards, which removed the transmission and storage segment from the new source performance standards, rescinded VOC and methane emissions standards for the transmission and storage segment, and rescinded methane emissions standards for the production and processing segments.\nFrom time to time, there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level.  In addition, there were proposals and positions taken by President Biden during his campaign regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and waters.  Further, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14008 entitled \"Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,\" directing the Secretary of the Interior, to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders, to, among other things, pause approval of new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices.\nIn addition to the above-described federal regulations, some state and local governments have imposed, or have considered imposing, various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations, including requirements regarding casing and cementing of wells; testing of nearby water wells; restrictions on access to, and usage of, water; disclosure of the chemical additives used in hydraulic fracturing operations; restrictions on the type of chemical additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations; and restrictions on drilling or injection activities on certain lands lying within wilderness wetlands, ecologically or seismically sensitive areas, and other protected areas.  Such federal, state and local permitting and disclosure requirements, operating restrictions, conditions or prohibition could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and, moreover, could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing.\nCompliance with laws and regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing and other aspects of our operations increases EOG's overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on EOG's operations, financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, it is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that EOG will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations.  However, EOG is unable to predict (i) the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing in the United States or other aspects of our operations and (ii) the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on EOG's operations, financial condition and results of operations relating to such future laws and regulations.  The direct and indirect costs of such laws and regulations (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect EOG's operations, financial condition and results of operations.\n10\nOther International Regulation.\nEOG's exploration and production operations outside the United States are subject to various types of regulations, including environmental regulations, imposed by the respective governments of the countries in which EOG's operations are conducted, and may affect EOG's operations and costs of compliance within those countries.  EOG currently has operations in Trinidad, China and Canada, and an exploration program in Oman. EOG is unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws, regulations or treaties, including those regarding climate change and hydraulic fracturing, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect EOG's operations, financial condition and results of operations.  EOG will continue to review the risks to its business and operations outside the United States associated with all environmental matters, including climate change and hydraulic fracturing regulation.  In addition, EOG will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation, regulations and treaties in the areas outside the United States where it operates to determine the impact on its operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary.\nOther Regulation.\nEOG has sand mining and processing operations in Texas and Wisconsin, which support EOG's exploration and development operations.  EOG's sand mining operations are subject to regulation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (in respect of safety and health matters) and by state agencies (in respect of air permitting and other environmental matters).  The information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.104) is included in Exhibit 95 to this report.\nFor additional discussion regarding the regulatory-related risks to which EOG's operations, financial condition and results of operations are or may be subject, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.\nOther Matters\nEnergy Prices.\nEOG is a crude oil and natural gas producer and is impacted by changes in the prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas.  During the last three years, average United States commodity prices have fluctuated, at times rather dramatically.  Average crude oil and condensate prices received by EOG for production in the United States decreased 33% in 2020 and 11% in 2019 and increased 28% in 2018, each as compared to the immediately preceding year.  EOG's quarterly price realizations ranged from $20.40 per barrel to $46.97 per barrel in 2020.  Average NGL prices received by EOG for production in the United States decreased 16% in 2020 and 40% in 2019 and increased 18% in 2018, each as compared to the immediately preceding year.  These fluctuations resulted in a 27% decrease in the average wellhead natural gas price received by EOG for production in the United States in 2020, a 23% decrease in 2019, and a 31% increase (inclusive of a positive revenue adjustment of $0.44 per Mcf related to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09) in 2018, each as compared to the immediately preceding year.\nDue to the many uncertainties associated with the world political and economic environment (for example, the actions of other crude oil exporting nations, including the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and the duration and impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), the global supply of, and demand for, crude oil, NGLs and natural gas and the availability of other energy supplies, the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers and other factors, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in the prices of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the future.  For additional discussion regarding changes in crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices and the risks that such changes may present to EOG, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.\nIncluding the impact of EOG's crude oil and NGL derivative contracts (exclusive of basis swaps) and based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity in 2021 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in NGL price, is approximately $99 million for net income and $127 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities.  Including the impact of EOG's natural gas derivative contracts and based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2021 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $31 million for net income and $40 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities.  For a summary of EOG's financial commodity derivative contracts through February 18, 2021, see ITEM 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity - Commodity Derivative Transactions.  For a summary of EOG's financial commodity derivative contracts for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, see Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n11\nRisk Management.\nEOG engages in price risk management activities from time to time.  These activities are intended to manage EOG's exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas.  EOG utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments, primarily price swap, option, swaption, collar and basis swap contracts, as a means to manage this price risk.  See Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements.  For a summary of EOG's financial commodity derivative contracts through February 18, 2021, see ITEM 7,  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ‑ Capital Resources and Liquidity - Commodity Derivative Transactions.\nAll of EOG's crude oil, NGL and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for, and development, production and transportation of, crude oil, NGL and natural gas, including rig and well explosions, cratering, fires, loss of well control and leaks and spills, each of which could result in damage to life, property and/or the environment.  EOG's operations are also subject to certain perils, including hurricanes, flooding and other adverse weather events.  Moreover, EOG's activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations.  Losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce EOG's revenues and increase costs to EOG to the extent not covered by insurance.\nInsurance is maintained by EOG against some, but not all, of these risks in accordance with what EOG believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that EOG believes to be prudent and commercially practicable.  Specifically, EOG maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by third-party insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving EOG's operations (subject to policy terms and conditions).  Moreover, in the event an incident involving EOG's operations results in negative environmental effects, EOG maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by third-party insurers for obligations, expenses or claims that EOG may incur from such an incident, including obligations, expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution, cleanup and containment, evacuation expenses and control of the well (subject to policy terms and conditions).  In the event of a well control incident resulting in negative environmental effects, such operators extra expense coverage would be EOG's primary coverage, with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to EOG.  All of EOG's drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other third-party service contractors.  The indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations.\nIn addition to the above-described risks, EOG's operations outside the United States are subject to certain risks, including the risk of increases in taxes and governmental royalties, changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreign-based companies, expropriation of assets, unilateral or forced renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities, currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations.  Please refer to ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, for further discussion of the risks to which EOG is subject with respect to its operations outside the United States.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe current executive officers of EOG and their names and ages (as of February 25, 2021) are as follows:\n12\nWilliam R.

    "text": "Our business and operations are subject to many risks.\nThe risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial.\nIf any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nThe following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes.\nUnless the context requires otherwise, “we,” “us,” “our” and “EOG” refer to EOG Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition, Results of Operations and Cash Flows\nCrude oil, natural gas and NGL prices are volatile, and a substantial and extended decline in commodity prices can have a material and adverse effect on us.\nPrices for crude oil and natural gas (including prices for natural gas liquids (NGLs) and condensate) fluctuate widely. Among the interrelated factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are:\n•\ndomestic and worldwide supplies of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n•\ndomestic and international drilling activity;\n13\n•\nthe actions of other crude oil producing and exporting nations, including the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n•\nconsumer and industrial/commercial demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n•\nworldwide economic conditions, geopolitical factors and political conditions, including, but not limited to, the imposition of tariffs or trade or other economic sanctions, political instability or armed conflict in oil and gas producing regions;\n•\nthe duration and economic and financial impact of epidemics, pandemics or other public health issues, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n•\nthe availability, proximity and capacity of appropriate transportation, gathering, processing, compression, storage and refining facilities;\n•\nthe price and availability of, and demand for, competing energy sources, including alternative energy sources;\n•\nthe effect of worldwide energy conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements and climate change-related initiatives;\n•\nthe nature and extent of governmental regulation, including any changes or other actions which may result from the recent elections in the United States of America (United States or U.S.) and change in administration, and including environmental and other climate change-related regulation, regulation of derivatives transactions and hedging activities, tax laws and regulations and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas and related commodities;\n•\nthe level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets, including trading by commodity price speculators and others; and\n•\nweather conditions and changes in weather patterns.\nIn the first half of 2020, the prices for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas declined substantially as a result of the economic downturn and overall reduction of demand prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the oversupply of crude oil from certain foreign oil-exporting countries.  In the second half of 2020, (i) the prices for NGLs and natural gas recovered to pre-pandemic levels and (ii) the prices for crude oil increased but remain significantly below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe above-described factors and the volatility of commodity prices make it difficult to predict crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices in 2021 and thereafter.  As a result, there can be no assurance that the prices for crude oil, NGLs and/or natural gas will continue to increase from, or sustain, their current levels, nor can there be any assurance that the prices for crude oil, NGLs and/or natural gas will not again decline.\nOur cash flows and results of operations depend to a great extent on prevailing commodity prices.\nAccordingly, substantial and extended declines in commodity prices can materially and adversely affect the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and operating expenses, the terms on which we can access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations.\nLower commodity prices can also reduce the amount of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas that we can produce economically.\nSubstantial and extended declines in the prices of these commodities can render uneconomic a portion of our exploration, development and exploitation projects, resulting in our having to make downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and also possibly shut in or plug and abandon certain wells.\nIn addition, significant prolonged decreases in commodity prices may cause the expected future cash flows from our properties to fall below their respective net book values, which would require us to write down the value of our properties.\nSuch reserve write-downs and asset impairments can materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock.\nIn fact, the substantial declines in crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices that occurred in the first half of 2020 materially and adversely affected the amount of cash flows we had available for our 2020 capital expenditures and operating expenses, our results of operations during the first half of 2020 and the trading price of our common stock.\nSuch commodity price declines also resulted in aggregate impairment charges of approximately $1.8 billion in the first half of 2020 with respect to our proved oil and gas properties and related assets.  Such declines in commodity prices also resulted in our making a downward adjustment of 278 million barrels of oil equivalent to our estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2020.\n14\nIf commodity prices decline from current levels for an extended period of time, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations will be adversely affected and we may be limited in our ability to maintain our current level of dividends on our common stock.\nIn addition, we may be required to incur additional impairment charges and/or make additional downward adjustments to our proved reserve estimates.\nAs a result, our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have substantial capital requirements, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nWe make, and will continue to make, substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration, development, production and transportation of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves.\nWe intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows from operations and sales of non-core assets and, to a lesser extent and if and as necessary, commercial paper borrowings, bank borrowings, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings.\nLower crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices, however, reduce our cash flows and could also delay or impair our ability to consummate certain planned non-core asset sales and divestitures. Further, if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines, we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable, if at all.  In addition, weakness and/or volatility in domestic and global financial markets or economic conditions or a depressed commodity price environment may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay or adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings.\nSimilarly, a reduction in our cash flows (for example, as a result of lower crude oil, natural gas and/or NGLs prices or unanticipated well shut-ins) and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may also increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay.  A substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment.\nAny of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, our ability to obtain financings, our borrowing costs and the terms of any financings are, in part, dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies.\nThe interrelated factors that may impact our credit ratings include our debt levels; planned capital expenditures and sales of assets; near-term and long-term production growth opportunities; liquidity; asset quality; cost structure; product mix; and commodity pricing levels (including, but not limited to, the estimates and assumptions of credit rating agencies with respect to future commodity prices).\nWe cannot provide any assurance that our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that our credit ratings will be raised in the future, nor can we provide any assurance that any of our credit ratings will not be lowered.\nReserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions.\nAny significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated.\nEstimating quantities of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex, inexact process.\nIt requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors, made by our management.\nAny significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated.\nAlso, the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history, continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions and improvements and other changes in geological, geophysical and engineering evaluation methods.\n15\nTo prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves, we analyze many variable factors, such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas.\nWe also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary.\nThe process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, production costs, gathering, processing, compression, storage and transportation costs, severance, ad valorem and other applicable taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs.\nMany of these factors are or may be beyond our control.\nOur actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates.\nAny significant variance, including any significant downward revisions to our existing reserve estimates, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock.\nFor related discussion, see ITEM 2, Properties - Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Properties and Reserves and Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time, our reserves and production will decline from their current levels.\nThe rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced.\nExcept to the extent that we conduct successful exploration, exploitation and development activities resulting in additional reserves, acquire additional properties containing reserves or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our reserves will decline as they are produced.\nMaintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at, or increasing our production from, current levels, is, therefore, highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves, which may be adversely impacted by bans or restrictions on drilling.\nTo the extent we are unsuccessful in acquiring or finding additional reserves, our future cash flows and results of operations and, in turn, the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur hedging activities may prevent us from fully benefiting from increases in crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks, including counterparty risk.\nWe use derivative instruments (primarily financial basis swap, price swap, option, swaption and collar contracts) to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows.\nTo the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines, we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts.\nA portion of our forecasted production for 2021 and 2022 is subject to fluctuating market prices. If we are ultimately unable to hedge additional production volumes for 2021, 2022 and beyond, we may be materially and adversely impacted by any declines in commodity prices, which may result in lower net cash provided by operating activities.\nIn addition, our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts.\nThe inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us.\nWe have various customers for the crude oil, natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties, including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions.\nDomestic and global economic conditions, including the financial condition of financial institutions generally, may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us, as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes.\nMoreover, our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors, such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions.\nFurthermore, if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil, natural gas or related commodities from us, we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable, if at all, due to the geographic location of such production; the availability, proximity and capacity of appropriate gathering, processing, compression, storage, transportation and refining facilities; or market or other factors and conditions.\n16\nThe inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nDrilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a high-risk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control.\nDrilling crude oil and natural gas wells, including development wells, involves numerous risks, including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil, NGLs and/or natural gas reserves.\nAs a result, we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells.\nSpecifically, we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and operating wells, and our drilling operations and those of our third-party operators may be curtailed, delayed or canceled, the cost of such operations may increase and/or our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted, as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n•\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n•\ntitle problems;\n•\npressure or irregularities in formations;\n•\nequipment failures or accidents;\n•\nadverse weather conditions, such as winter storms, flooding, tropical storms and hurricanes, and changes in weather patterns;\n•\ncompliance with, or changes in (including the adoption of new), environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to air emissions, hydraulic fracturing, access to and use of water, disposal or other discharge (e.g., into injection wells) of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, laws and regulations imposing conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil and natural gas, and other laws and regulations, such as tax laws and regulations;\n•\nthe availability and timely issuance of required federal, state, tribal and other permits and licenses, which may be adversely affected by (among other things) bans or restrictions on drilling, government shutdowns or other suspensions of, or delays in, government services;\n•\nthe availability of, costs associated with and terms of contractual arrangements for properties, including mineral licenses and leases, pipelines, crude oil hauling trucks and qualified drivers and facilities and equipment to gather, process, compress, store, transport, market and export crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; and\n•\nthe costs of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, hydraulic fracturing services, pressure pumping equipment and supplies, tubular materials, water, sand, disposal facilities, qualified personnel and other necessary facilities, equipment, materials, supplies and services.\nOur failure to recover our investment in wells, increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators, and/or curtailments, delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our third-party operators, in each case, due to any of the above factors or other factors, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally, see the immediately following risk factor.\nOur crude oil, NGLs and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities, and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities.\nOur crude oil, NGLs and natural gas operations and supporting activities and operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for, and producing, gathering, processing, compressing, storing and transporting, crude oil and natural gas, including the risks of:\n•\nwell blowouts and cratering;\n•\nloss of well control;\n•\ncrude oil spills, natural gas leaks, formation water (i.e., produced water) spills and pipeline ruptures;\n17\n•\npipe failures and casing collapses;\n•\nuncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas, formation water or drilling fluids;\n•\nreleases of chemicals, wastes or pollutants;\n•\nadverse weather events, such as winter storms, flooding, tropical storms and hurricanes, and other natural disasters;\n•\nfires and explosions;\n•\nterrorism, vandalism and physical, electronic and cybersecurity breaches;\n•\nformations with abnormal or unexpected pressures;\n•\nleaks or spills in connection with, or associated with, the gathering, processing, compression, storage and transportation of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas; and\n•\nmalfunctions of, or damage to, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities and equipment and other facilities and equipment utilized in support of our crude oil and natural gas operations.\nIf any of these events occur, we could incur losses, liabilities and other additional costs as a result of:\n•\ninjury or loss of life;\n•\ndamage to, or destruction of, property, facilities, equipment and crude oil and natural gas reservoirs;\n•\npollution or other environmental damage;\n•\nregulatory investigations and penalties as well as cleanup and remediation responsibilities and costs;\n•\nsuspension or interruption of our operations, including due to injunction;\n•\nrepairs necessary to resume operations; and\n•\ncompliance with laws and regulations enacted as a result of such events.\nWe maintain insurance against many, but not all, such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable.\nHowever, the occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events, if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage, would reduce the funds available to us for our operations and could, in turn, have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to sell and deliver our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering, processing, compression, storage, transportation and export facilities and equipment are unavailable.\nThe sale of our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression, storage, transportation and export facilities and equipment owned by third parties.\nThese facilities and equipment may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions, regulatory reasons, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable, if at all.\nIn particular, in certain newer plays, the capacity of gathering, processing, compression, storage, transportation and export facilities and equipment may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells.\nIn addition, lack of financing, construction and permitting delays, permitting costs and regulatory or other constraints could limit or delay the construction, manufacture or other acquisition of new gathering, processing, compression, storage, transportation and export facilities and equipment by third parties or us, and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines, gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery.\nAny significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering, processing, compression, storage, transportation and export facilities and equipment or the availability of these facilities and equipment, including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities and equipment on terms acceptable to us or at all, could materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\n18\nA portion of our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us.\nA portion of our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas production may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for various reasons, including, but not limited to, as a result of accidents, weather conditions, the unavailability of gathering, processing, compression, storage, transportation, refining or export facilities or equipment or field labor issues, or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil, NGLs or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic.\nIf a substantial amount of our production is interrupted or shut in, our cash flows and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties that we do not operate.\nSome of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners.\nAs a result, we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties.\nMoreover, we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects.\nIn addition, a third-party operator could also decide to shut-in or curtail production from wells, or plug and abandon marginal wells, on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil, NGLs or natural gas prices.\nThese limitations and our dependence on the operator and third-party working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs, lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we acquire crude oil, NGLs and natural gas properties, our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems, to accurately estimate reserves, production rates or costs, or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties - for example, our October 2016 mergers and related asset purchase transactions with Yates Petroleum Corporation and certain of its affiliated entities.\nAlthough we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices, reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems (such as title or environmental issues), nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to fully assess their deficiencies and potential.\nEven when problems with a property are identified, we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements.\nIn addition, there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves (as discussed further above), actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties.  Actual reserves, production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates.  In addition, an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations, particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations.\nCompetition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense, and some of our competitors have greater resources than we have.\nWe compete with major integrated oil and gas companies, government-affiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases, properties and reserves and access to the facilities, equipment, materials, services and employees and other personnel (including geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other specialists) necessary to explore for, develop, produce, market and transport crude oil, NGLs and natural gas.  Certain of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic long-term positions or strong governmental relationships in countries or areas in which we may seek new or expanded entry.  As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects, such as in bidding for drilling rights or in accessing necessary services, facilities, equipment, materials and personnel.  In addition, our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels.  We also face competition from competing energy sources, such as renewable energy sources.\n19\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nWe operate in other countries and, as a result, are subject to certain political, economic and other risks.\nOur operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations.\nThese risks include, among other risks:\n•\nincreases in taxes and governmental royalties;\n•\nchanges in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies;\n•\nloss of revenue, loss of or damage to equipment, property and other assets and interruption of operations as a result of expropriation, nationalization, acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest and other political risks;\n•\nunilateral or forced renegotiation, modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities;\n•\ndifficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations; and\n•\ncurrency restrictions or exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur international operations may also be adversely affected by U.S. laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation, including tariffs or trade or other economic sanctions; modifications to, or withdrawal from, international trade treaties; and U.S. laws with respect to participation in boycotts that are not supported by the U.S. government.  The realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar.\nHowever, certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the U.S. and have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nThe assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.\nTo prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates.\nConsequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if the amount has not changed in the original currency.\nThese translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, less than 1% of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Legal Matters\nThe regulatory, legislative and policy changes pursued by the new U.S. presidential administration may materially and adversely affect the oil and gas exploration and production industry.\nIn November 2020, Joseph R. Biden Jr. was elected President of the United States.  New or revised rules, regulations and policies may be issued, and new legislation may be proposed, during the current administration that could impact the oil and gas exploration and production industry.  Such rules, regulations, policies and legislation may affect, among other things, (i) permitting for oil and gas drilling on federal lands, (ii) the leasing of federal lands for oil and gas development, (iii) the regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and/or other climate change-related matters associated with oil and gas operations, (iv) the use of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands, (v) the calculation of royalty payments in respect of oil and gas production from federal lands and (vi) U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to oil and gas exploration and production companies.  On January 27, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14008 entitled “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,” directing the Secretary of the Interior, to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders, to (i) pause approval of new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices and (ii) consider whether to adjust royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from federal lands and offshore waters to account for corresponding climate costs.\n20\nFurther, such regulatory, legislative and policy changes may, among other things, result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements, additional operating restrictions and/or the imposition of various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations or other aspects of our business, any of which could lead to operational delays, increased operating and compliance costs and/or other impacts on our business and operations and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor related discussion, see the below risk factors regarding legislative and regulatory matters impacting the oil and gas exploration and production industry.\nWe incur certain costs to comply with government regulations, particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety, and could incur even greater costs in the future.\nOur crude oil, NGLs and natural gas operations and supporting activities are regulated extensively by federal, state, tribal and local governments and regulatory agencies, both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business, and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental, health, safety or other considerations.\nMoreover, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental, health, safety and other regulations.\nFurther, the regulatory environment could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and/or adversely affect our business and operations and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including any changes that may result from the recent U.S. elections and change in administration (see the risk factor above with respect to the new U.S. administration).\nSpecifically, as a current or past owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties, we are subject to various federal, state, tribal, local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment.\nThese regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from current or past operations, subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas.\nChanges in, or additions to, these regulations, including any changes that may result from the recent U.S. elections and change in administration, could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe regulation of hydraulic fracturing is primarily conducted at the state and local level through permitting and other compliance requirements and, further, some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has issued regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing and there have been various other proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level.\nIn addition, there were proposals and positions taken by President Biden during his campaign regarding the use of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and waters.  Further, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14008 entitled \"Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,\" directing the Secretary of the Interior, to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders, to, among other things, pause approval of new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices.\nAny such requirements, restrictions, conditions or prohibition could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and, further, could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing.\nAccordingly, our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected.\nFor additional discussion regarding hydraulic fracturing regulation, see Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing and Other Operations - United States under ITEM 1, Business - Regulation.\nWe will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies, legislation, regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. We are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws, regulations or treaties, but the direct and indirect costs of such laws, regulations and treaties (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSee also the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities (such as EOG) that participate in such transactions.\n21\nRegulations, government policies and government and corporate initiatives relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could have a significant impact on our operations and we could incur significant cost in the future to comply.\nLocal, state, federal and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on GHG emissions and climate change issues in recent years.\nFor example, we are subject to the U.S. EPA’s rule requiring annual reporting of GHG emissions.\nIn addition, our oil and gas production and processing operations are subject to the U.S. EPA's new source performance standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds from new, modified and reconstructed crude oil and natural gas wells and equipment located at natural gas production gathering and booster stations and gas processing plants.\nAt the international level, in December 2015, the U.S. participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France.\nThe Paris Agreement (adopted at the conference) calls for nations to undertake efforts with respect to global temperatures and GHG emissions.\nThe Paris Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016.\nWhile the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020, President Biden issued an executive order on January 20, 2021 recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement.\nIn addition, many state and local officials have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord.\nFurther, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14008 entitled 'Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,' directing the Secretary of the Interior, to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders, to, among other things, consider whether to adjust royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from federal lands and offshore waters to account for corresponding climate costs.\nIt is possible that the Paris Agreement and subsequent domestic and international regulations and government policies will have adverse effects on the market for crude oil, natural gas and other fossil fuel products as well as adverse effects on the business and operations of companies engaged in the exploration for, and production of, crude oil, natural gas and other fossil fuel products.\nWe are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any currently proposed or future investigations, laws, regulations, treaties or policies regarding climate change and GHG emissions (including any laws and regulations that may be enacted in the U.S. by the new administration), but the direct and indirect costs of such developments (if enacted, issued or applied) could materially and adversely affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, the increasing attention to global climate change risks has created the potential for a greater likelihood of governmental investigations and private and public litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.  For additional discussion regarding climate change regulation, see (i) Climate Change - United States under ITEM 1, Business – Regulation and (ii) the risk factor above with respect to the new U.S. administration.\nIn addition, the achievement of our current or future internal initiatives relating to the reduction of GHG emissions may increase our costs, including requiring us to purchase emissions credits or offsets, or may impact or otherwise limit our ability to execute on our business plans.\nFurther, increasing attention to global climate change risks has created the potential for a greater likelihood of governmental investigations and private and public litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nTax laws and regulations applicable to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies may change over time, and such changes could materially and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, legislation has been proposed that, if enacted into law, would make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, such as with respect to the intangible drilling and development costs deduction and bonus tax depreciation.  While these specific changes were not included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017, no accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes or similar or other tax law changes will be proposed in the future (for example, by the new U.S. administration) and, if enacted, what the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation would be.  The elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax deductions, as well as any other changes to, or the imposition of new, federal, state, local or non-U.S. taxes (including the imposition of, or increases in, production, severance or similar taxes), could materially and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, legislation may be proposed with respect to the enactment of a tax levied on the carbon content of fuels based on the GHG emissions associated with such fuels.\nA carbon tax would generally increase the prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs.\nSuch price increases may, in turn, reduce demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs and materially and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\n22\nWe are unable to predict the timing, scope and effect of any proposed or enacted tax law changes, but any such changes (if enacted) could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or enacted tax law changes to determine the impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition and take appropriate actions, where necessary.\nFederal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities.\nAs discussed in the risk factor above regarding our hedging activities, we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows.  In 2010, Congress adopted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which, among other matters, provides for federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and certain federal agencies that regulate the banking and insurance sectors (the Prudential Regulators)\nadopt rules or regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and providing definitions of terms used in the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivatives activities.\nAlthough some of the rules necessary to implement the Dodd-Frank Act are yet to be adopted, the CFTC, the SEC and the Prudential Regulators have issued numerous rules, including a rule establishing an “end-user” exception to mandatory clearing (End-User Exception), a rule regarding margin for uncleared swaps (Margin Rule) and a proposed rule imposing position limits (Position Limits Rule).\nWe qualify as a \"non-financial entity\" for purposes of the End-User Exception and, as such, we are eligible for such exception.\nAs a result, our hedging activities are not subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing.\nWe also qualify as a \"non-financial end user\" for purposes of the Margin Rule; therefore, our uncleared swaps are not subject to regulatory margin requirements.\nFinally, we believe our hedging activities would constitute bona fide hedging under the Position Limits Rule and would not be subject to limitation under such rule if it is enacted.\nHowever, many of our hedge counterparties and many other market participants are not eligible for the End-User Exception, are subject to mandatory clearing and the Margin Rule for swaps with some or all of their other swap counterparties, and may be subject to the Position Limits Rule.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations related to derivatives (collectively, Foreign Regulations) which apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such Foreign Regulations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, the rules adopted thereunder and the Foreign Regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts, alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, lessen the number of available counterparties and, in turn, increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties.\nIf our use of derivatives is reduced as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, related regulations or the Foreign Regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile, and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for, and fund, our capital expenditure requirements.  Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to COVID-19, Cybersecurity and Other External Factors\nOutbreaks of communicable diseases can adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGlobal or national health concerns, including a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, can, among other impacts, negatively impact the global economy, reduce demand and pricing for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, lead to operational disruptions and limit our ability to execute on our business plan, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, uncertainty regarding the impact of any outbreak of contagious disease could lead to increased volatility in crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices.\n23\nFor example, the current pandemic involving a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus (COVID-19) and the measures being taken to address and limit the spread of the virus have adversely affected the economies and financial markets of the world, resulting in an economic downturn that has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, global demand and prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs.\nIn fact, the substantial declines in crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices that occurred in the first half of 2020 as a result of the economic downturn and overall reduction of demand prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic (and the oversupply of crude oil from certain foreign oil-exporting countries) materially and adversely affected the amount of cash flows we had available for our 2020 capital expenditures and other operating expenses, our results of operations during the first half of 2020 and the trading price of our common stock.\nWhile in the second half of 2020 the prices for natural gas and NGLs recovered to pre-pandemic levels and the prices for crude oil increased from their first half 2020 levels, if such price declines were to reoccur and continue for an extended period of time, our cash flows and results of operations would be further adversely affected, as could the trading price of our common stock.\nFor further discussion regarding the potential impacts on us of lower commodity prices and extended declines in commodity prices, see the related discussion in the first risk factor in this section.\nFurther, if the COVID-19 outbreak should continue or worsen, we may also experience disruptions to commodities markets, equipment supply chains and the availability of our workforce, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and operations.\nIn addition, if the resulting economic downturn should continue or worsen, our customers and other contractual parties may be unable to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us, and may be unable to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes. Such inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, including the duration and severity of the outbreak and the extent of travel restrictions and business closures imposed in affected countries, to fully assess the potential impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and gas producer, we face various security threats, including (i) cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to, or control of, our sensitive information or to render our data or systems corrupted or unusable; (ii) threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or to the security of third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as gathering, transportation, processing, fractionation, refining and export facilities; and (iii) threats from terrorist acts.\nThe potential for such security threats has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems, including internally developed software, data hosting platforms, real-time data acquisition systems, third-party software, cloud services and other internally or externally hosted hardware and software platforms, to (i) estimate our oil and gas reserves, (ii) process and record financial and operating data, (iii) process and analyze all stages of our business operations, including exploration, drilling, completions, production, transportation, pipelines and other related activities and (iv) communicate with our employees and vendors, suppliers and other third parties.\nAlthough we have implemented and invested in, and will continue to implement and invest in, controls, procedures and protections (including internal and external personnel) that are designed to protect our systems, identify and remediate on a regular basis vulnerabilities in our systems and related infrastructure and monitor and mitigate the risk of data loss and other cybersecurity threats, such measures cannot entirely eliminate cybersecurity threats and the controls, procedures and protections we have implemented and invested in may prove to be ineffective.\nOur systems and networks, and those of our business associates, may become the target of cybersecurity attacks, including, without limitation, denial-of-service attacks; malicious software; data privacy breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access; cyber or phishing-attacks; ransomware; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other electronic security breaches.\nIf any of these security breaches were to occur, we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations, including our drilling, completion, production and corporate functions, which could materially and adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, the following:\n24\n•\nunauthorized access to, and release of, our business data, reserves information, strategic information or other sensitive or proprietary information, which could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to compete for oil and gas resources, or reduce our competitive advantage over other companies;\n•\ndata corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions during our drilling activities, which could result in our failure to reach the intended target or a drilling incident;\n•\ndata corruption or operational disruptions of our production-related infrastructure, which could result in loss of production or accidental discharges;\n•\nunauthorized access to, and release of, personal information of our royalty owners, employees and vendors, which could expose us to allegations that we did not sufficiently protect such information;\n•\na cybersecurity attack on a vendor or service provider, which could result in supply chain disruptions and could delay or halt our operations;\n•\na cybersecurity attack on third-party gathering, transportation, processing, fractionation, refining or export facilities, which could result in reduced demand for our production or delay or prevent us from transporting and marketing our production, in either case resulting in a loss of revenues;\n•\na cybersecurity attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n•\na deliberate corruption of our financial or operating data could result in events of non-compliance which could then lead to regulatory fines or penalties;\n•\na cybersecurity attack on a communications network or power grid, which could cause operational disruptions resulting in a loss of revenues; and\n•\na cybersecurity attack on our automated and surveillance systems, which could cause a loss of production and potential environmental hazards.\nFurther, strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at a greater risk of terrorist attacks or cybersecurity attacks than other targets in the United States.\nMoreover, external digital technologies control nearly all of the crude oil and natural gas distribution and refining systems in the U.S. and abroad, which are necessary to transport and market our production.\nA cybersecurity attack directed at, for example, crude oil and natural gas distribution systems could (i) damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment; (ii) disrupt energy supplies and markets, by delaying or preventing delivery of production to markets; and (iii) make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.\nAny such terrorist attack or cybersecurity attack that affects us, our customers, suppliers, or others with whom we do business and/or energy-related assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, including disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation, a loss of counterparty trust, reimbursement or other costs, increased compliance costs, significant litigation exposure and legal liability or regulatory fines, penalties or intervention.\nAlthough we have business continuity plans in place, our operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our systems and the infrastructure that supports our business.\nWhile we continue to evolve and modify our business continuity plans as well as our cyber threat detection and mitigation systems, there can be no assurance that they will be effective in avoiding disruption and business impacts.\nFurther, our insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses, and the cost to obtain adequate coverage may increase for us in the future and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.\nWhile we have experienced limited cybersecurity attacks in the past, we have not suffered any losses as a result of such attacks; however, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future.\nFurther, as technologies evolve and cybersecurity threats become more sophisticated, we are continually expending additional resources to modify or enhance our security measures to protect against such threats and to identify and remediate on a regular basis any vulnerabilities in our information systems and related infrastructure that may be detected, and these expenditures in the future may be significant.\nAdditionally, the continuing and evolving threat of cybersecurity attacks has resulted in evolving legal and compliance matters, including increased regulatory focus on prevention, which could require us to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements.\n25\nTerrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us.\nTerrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks (including cyber-related attacks), whether domestic or foreign, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets.\nThe U.S. government has from time to time issued public warnings that indicate that energy-related assets, such as transportation and refining facilities, might be specific targets of terrorist organizations.\nAny such actions and the threat of such actions, including any resulting political instability or societal disruption, could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways, including, but not limited to, the disruption of energy supplies and markets, the reduction of overall demand for crude oil and natural gas, increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the facilities and other infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism, and, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWeather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us.\nDemand for crude oil and natural gas is, to a degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts, among other things, the price we receive for the commodities that we produce and, in turn, our cash flows and results of operations.\nFor example, relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas (as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses) and, as a result, lower prices for natural gas production during that season.\nIn addition, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with more frequent or more extreme weather events, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, changes to ground and surface water availability, and other related phenomena, which could affect some, or all, of our operations.\nOur exploration, exploitation and development activities and equipment could be adversely affected by extreme weather events, such as winter storms, flooding and tropical storms and hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or damaged facilities and equipment.\nSuch extreme weather events could also impact other areas of our operations, including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations, maintenance and repairs, the installation and operation of gathering, processing, compression, storage, transportation and/or export facilities and the availability of, and our access to, necessary third-party services, such as gathering, processing, compression, storage and transportation services and export services.\nSuch extreme weather events and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations."

Reserve engineering is a complex, subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner.  The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment.  As a result, estimates by different engineers normally vary.  In addition, results of drilling, testing and production or fluctuations in commodity prices subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate (upward or downward).  Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered.  Further, the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based.  For related discussion, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, and \"Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\n26\nIn general, the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced.  Except to the extent EOG acquires additional properties containing proved reserves, conducts successful exploration, exploitation and development activities or, through engineering studies, identifies additional behind-pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, the proved reserves of EOG will decline as reserves are produced.  Future production is, therefore, highly dependent upon the level of success of these activities.  For related discussion, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.  EOG's estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies are consistent with the information set forth in \"Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\nAcreage.\nThe following table summarizes EOG's gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2020.  Excluded is acreage in which EOG's interest is limited to owned royalty, overriding royalty and other similar interests.\nMost of our undeveloped oil and gas leases, particularly in the United States, are subject to lease expiration if initial wells are not drilled within a specified period, generally between three to five years.\nApproximately 0.2 million net acres will expire in 2021, 0.2 million net acres will expire in 2022 and 0.1 million net acres will expire in 2023 if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases or obtain concessions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were no proved undeveloped reserves (PUDs) associated with such undeveloped acreage.\nIn the ordinary course of business, based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics, we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future.\nMany of our oil and gas leases are large enough to accommodate more than one producing unit.  Included in our undeveloped acreage is non-producing acreage within such larger producing leases.\nThe agreement governing the acreage associated with our exploration program in Oman is set to expire in 2024, with certain provisions allowing for extension of such term if commercial discoveries are found.\nProductive Well Summary\n.  The following table represents EOG's gross and net productive wells, including 2,482 wells in which we hold a royalty interest.\n(1)    EOG operated 9,491 gross and 8,394 net producing crude oil and natural gas wells at December 31, 2020.  Gross crude oil and natural gas wells include 142 wells with multiple completions.\n27\nDrilling and Acquisition Activities\n.  During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, EOG expended $3.7 billion, $6.6 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively, for exploratory and development drilling, facilities and acquisition of leases and producing properties, including asset retirement obligations of $117 million, $186 million and $70 million, respectively.  The following tables set forth the results of the gross crude oil and natural gas wells completed for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nThe following tables set forth the results of the net crude oil and natural gas wells completed for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n28\nEOG participated in the drilling of wells that were in the process of being drilled or completed at the end of the period as set out in the table below for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nIncluded in the previous table of wells in progress at the end of the period were wells which had been drilled, but were not completed (DUCs).  In order to effectively manage its capital expenditures and to provide flexibility in managing its drilling rig and well completion schedules, EOG, from time to time, will have an inventory of DUCs.  At December 31, 2020, there were approximately 84 MMBoe of net PUDs associated with EOG's inventory of DUCs.  Under EOG's current drilling plan, all such DUCs are expected to be completed within five years from the original booking date of such reserves.  The following table sets forth EOG's DUCs, for which PUDs had been booked, as of the end of each period.\nEOG acquired wells as set forth in the following tables as of the end of each period (excluding the acquisition of additional interests in 8, 11 and 114 net wells in which EOG previously owned an interest for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively):\nOther Property, Plant and Equipment.\nEOG's other property, plant and equipment primarily includes gathering, transportation and processing infrastructure assets, buildings and sand processing assets which support EOG's exploration and production activities.  EOG does not own drilling rigs, hydraulic fracturing equipment or rail cars.  All of EOG's drilling and completion activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other third-party service contractors.\n29"

In connection with the adoption of ASU 2014-09, EOG presents natural gas processing fees relating to certain processing and marketing agreements within its United States segment as Gathering and Processing Costs instead of as a deduction to Natural Gas Revenues.  There was no impact to operating income, net income or cash flows resulting from changes to the presentation of natural gas processing fees.  EOG elected to adopt ASU 2014-09 using the modified retrospective approach with no reclassification of amounts for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (see Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements).\n(2)    Effective January 1, 2020, EOG adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-13, \"Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\" (ASU 2016-13).  ASU 2016-13 changes the impairment model for financial assets and certain other instruments by requiring entities to adopt a forward-looking expected loss model that will result in earlier recognition of credit losses.  EOG elected to adopt ASU 2016-13 using the modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date.  Financial results reported in periods prior to January 1, 2020, are unchanged.  There was no impact to retained earnings upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 and EOG expects current and future credit losses to be immaterial.  EOG continues to monitor the credit risk from third-party companies to determine if expected credit losses may become material.\n(3)    Effective January 1, 2019, EOG adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842)\" (ASU 2016-02), which require that lessees recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and related lease liability, representing the obligation to make lease payments of certain lease transactions, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  EOG elected to adopt ASU 2016-02 and other related ASUs using the modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the effective date.  Financial results reported in periods prior to January 1, 2019, are unchanged.  There was no impact to retained earnings upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 and other related ASUs.  See Notes 1 and 18 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(4)    Effective January 1, 2017, EOG adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-17, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\" (ASU 2015-17), which simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes in a classified balance sheet by eliminating the requirement to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts.  Instead, ASU 2015-17 requires that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be shown as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.  In connection with the adoption of ASU 2015-17, EOG restated $160 million from deferred tax liabilities to deferred tax assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016.\n32"

    "text": "Overview\nEOG Resources, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, EOG), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the United States with proved reserves in the United States, Trinidad and China.  EOG operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries.  Pursuant to this strategy, each prospective drilling location is evaluated by its estimated rate of return.  This strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing EOG to deliver long-term growth in shareholder value and maintain a strong balance sheet.  EOG implements its strategy primarily by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves.  Maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure, coupled with efficient and safe operations and robust environmental stewardship practices and performance, is integral in the implementation of EOG's strategy.\nEOG realized a net loss of $605 million during 2020 as compared to net income of $2,735 million for 2019.  At December 31, 2020, EOG's total estimated net proved reserves were 3,220 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), a decrease of 109 MMBoe from December 31, 2019.  During 2020, net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs) reserves decreased by 108 million barrels (MMBbl), and net proved natural gas reserves decreased by 9 billion cubic feet or 1 MMBoe, in each case from December 31, 2019.\nRecent Developments\nCommodity Prices.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures being taken to address and limit the spread of the virus have adversely affected the economies and financial markets of the world, resulting in an economic downturn that has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, global demand and prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas.  See ITEM 1A, Risk Factors for further discussion.\nIn early March 2020, due to the failure of the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia (OPEC+) to reach an agreement on individual crude oil production limits, Saudi Arabia unilaterally reduced the sales price of its crude oil and announced that it would increase its crude oil production.  The combination of these actions, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on crude oil demand, resulted in significantly lower commodity prices in March and April 2020.  In April 2020, the members of OPEC+ reached an agreement to cut crude oil production beginning in May 2020 and extending through April 2022 with the quantity of the production cuts decreasing over time.  Subsequent indications of conformity with these agreed-upon production cuts by OPEC+, combined with the evolving impacts of COVID-19 on crude oil demand, have resulted in gradually-improving market conditions.  In the second half of 2020, crude oil prices increased, but remain significantly below average prices in 2019, as a result of the continuing rebalancing of crude oil supply resulting from the actions of OPEC+ and the continuing effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on global demand.  In addition, NGL and natural gas prices have recovered to pre-pandemic levels.\nIn response to the commodity price environment in 2020, EOG reduced activity across its operating areas and decreased its total capital expenditures.  EOG also elected to reduce crude oil production, by delaying initial production from new wells and shutting-in or otherwise curtailing existing production.\nIn early 2021, the members of OPEC+ met and agreed to taper off certain of their production curtailments (agreed to in April 2020) through March 2021.  Subsequent to the meeting, Saudi Arabia announced that it would unilaterally cut its production by an additional one million barrels per day in February 2021 and March 2021.  These announcements have had a positive impact on crude oil prices.\nAs a result of the many uncertainties associated with (i) the world economic environment, (ii) the COVID-19 pandemic and its continuing effect on the economies and financial markets of the world and (iii) any future actions by the members of OPEC+, and the effect of these uncertainties on worldwide supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices in the future.  However, prices for crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas have historically been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue.  For related discussion, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.\nEOG will continue to monitor future market conditions and adjust its capital allocation strategy and production outlook accordingly in order to maximize shareholder value while maintaining its strong financial position.\n33\n2020 Election.\nIn November 2020, Joseph R. Biden Jr. was elected President of the United States.  On January 27, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14008 entitled \"Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,\" directing the Secretary of the Interior, to the extent consistent with applicable law and in consultation with other agencies and stakeholders, to (i) pause approval of new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices and (ii) consider whether to adjust royalties associated with oil and gas resources extracted from federal lands and offshore waters to account for corresponding climate costs.\nIn addition, new or revised rules, regulations and policies may be issued, and new legislation may be proposed, during the current administration that could impact the oil and gas exploration and production industry.  Such rules, regulations, policies and legislation may affect, among other things, (i) permitting for oil and gas drilling on federal lands, (ii) the leasing of federal lands for oil and gas development, (iii) the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and/or other climate change-related matters associated with oil and gas operations, (iv) the use of hydraulic fracturing on federal lands, (v) the calculation of royalty payments in respect of oil and gas production from federal lands and (vi) U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to oil and gas exploration and production companies.  See \"Regulation\" in ITEM 1, Business and ITEM 1A, Risk Factors for further discussion.\nEOG will continue to monitor and assess any actions that could impact the oil and gas industry, to determine the impact on its business and operations, and take appropriate actions where necessary.\nOperations\nSeveral important developments have occurred since January 1, 2020.\nUnited States.\nEOG's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful.  EOG continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to, and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to, EOG's crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas production.  EOG has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs.\nDuring 2020, EOG continued to focus on increasing drilling, completion and operating efficiencies gained in prior years.  Such efficiencies, combined with new innovation and decreased service costs, resulted in lower operating, drilling and completion costs in 2020.  In addition, EOG continued to evaluate certain potential crude oil and condensate, NGLs and  natural gas exploration and development prospects and to look for opportunities to add drilling inventory through leasehold acquisitions, farm-ins, exchanges or tactical acquisitions.  On a volumetric basis, as calculated using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and NGLs production accounted for approximately 76% and 77% of United States production during 2020 and 2019, respectively.  During 2020, drilling and completion activities occurred primarily in the Delaware Basin play, Eagle Ford play and Rocky Mountain area.  EOG's major producing areas in the United States are in New Mexico and Texas.  In the second quarter of 2020, EOG delayed initial production from most newly-completed wells and shut in some existing production.  During the third quarter of 2020, EOG resumed the process of initiating production from completed wells, and the legacy wells that were shut-in were largely brought back on-line.  See ITEM 1, Business - Exploration and Production for further discussion.\nTrinidad.\nIn Trinidad, EOG continues to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. Several fields in the South East Coast Consortium Block, Modified U(a) Block, Block 4(a), Modified U(b) Block, the Banyan Field and the Sercan Area have been developed and are producing natural gas, which is sold to the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited and its subsidiary, and crude oil and condensate which is sold to Heritage Petroleum Company Limited.\nIn 2020, EOG drilled three net wells and completed two net wells in Trinidad.  The remaining net well made a discovery that is being evaluated.\nOther International.\nIn the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China, EOG continues to work with its partner, PetroChina, under the Production Sharing Contract and other related agreements, to ensure uninterrupted production. All natural gas produced from the Baijaochang Field is sold under a long-term contract to PetroChina.\nIn 2020, EOG entered into two agreements related to exploration and production rights in the Sultanate of Oman (Oman).  One agreement resulted in EOG acquiring exploration and production rights to Block 36 within Oman.  The second agreement was a farm-in agreement allowing EOG to share in exploration and production rights within Block 49.  Pursuant to that agreement, EOG participated in the drilling of one gross exploratory well which was in progress as of December 31, 2020.\nIn March 2020, EOG began the process of exiting its Canada operations.\n34\nEOG continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the United States, primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified.\nCapital Structure\nOne of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in EOG's peer group.  EOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 22% at December 31, 2020 and 19% at December 31, 2019.  As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.\nOn April 1, 2020, EOG repaid upon maturity the $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.45% Senior Notes due 2020.\nOn April 14, 2020, EOG closed on its offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.375% Senior Notes due 2030 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.950% Senior Notes due 2050 (together, the Notes).  EOG received net proceeds of $1.48 billion from the issuance of the Notes, which were used to repay the 4.40% Senior Notes due 2020 when they matured on June 1, 2020 (see below), and for general corporate purposes, including the funding of capital expenditures.\nOn June 1, 2020, EOG repaid upon maturity the $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.40% Senior Notes due 2020.\nOn February 1, 2021, EOG repaid upon maturity the $750 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.100% Senior Notes due 2021.\nDuring 2020, EOG funded $4.0 billion ($386 million of which was non-cash) in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations), repaid $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of long-term debt and paid $821 million in dividends to common stockholders, primarily by utilizing net cash provided from its operating activities, net proceeds of $1.48 billion from the issuance of the Notes and net proceeds of $192 million from the sale of assets.\nTotal anticipated 2021 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, excluding acquisitions and non-cash transactions.  The majority of 2021 expenditures will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activities.  EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program, bank borrowings, borrowings under its senior unsecured revolving credit facility, joint development agreements and similar agreements and equity and debt offerings.\nManagement continues to believe EOG has one of the strongest prospect inventories in EOG's history.  When it fits EOG's strategy, EOG will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer incremental exploration and/or production opportunities.\n35\nResults of Operations\nThe following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of EOG and notes thereto beginning on page F-1.\nOperating Revenues and Other\nDuring 2020, operating revenues decreased $6,348 million, or 37%, to $11,032 million from $17,380 million in 2019.  Total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of EOG's production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, decreased $4,291, or 37%, to $7,290 million in 2020 from $11,581 million in 2019.  Revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and NGLs in 2020 were approximately 89% of total wellhead revenues compared to 90% in 2019.  During 2020, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $1,145 million compared to net gains of $180 million in 2019.  Gathering, processing and marketing revenues decreased $2,777 million during 2020, to $2,583 million from $5,360 million in 2019.  Net losses on asset dispositions of $47 million in 2020 were primarily due to the sales of proved properties and non-cash property exchanges of unproved leasehold in Texas and New Mexico and the disposition of the Marcellus Shale assets compared to net gains on asset dispositions of $124 million in 2019.\n36\nWellhead volume and price statistics for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\n(1)    Thousand barrels per day or million cubic feet per day, as applicable.\n(2)\nOther International includes EOG's United Kingdom, China and Canada operations.  The United Kingdom operations were sold in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n(3)\nDollars per barrel or per thousand cubic feet, as applicable.  Excludes the impact of financial commodity derivative instruments (see Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements).\n(4)\nThousand barrels of oil equivalent per day or million barrels of oil equivalent, as applicable; includes crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas.  Crude oil equivalent volumes are determined using a ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or NGLs to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas.  MMBoe is calculated by multiplying the MBoed amount by the number of days in the period and then dividing that amount by one thousand.\n37\n2020 compared to 2019.\nWellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2020 decreased $3,827 million, or 40%, to $5,786 million from $9,613 million in 2019, due primarily to a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($2,860 million) and a decrease in production ($967 million).  EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2020 decreased 33% to $38.63 per barrel compared to $57.72 per barrel in 2019.  Wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2020 decreased 10% to 409 MBbld as compared to 456 MBbld in 2019.  The decreased production was primarily in the Eagle Ford and the Rocky Mountain area, partially offset by increased production in the Permian Basin.\nNGLs revenues in 2020 decreased $116 million, or 15%, to $668 million from $784 million in 2019 primarily due to a lower composite average wellhead NGLs price ($130 million), partially offset by an increase in production ($13 million).  EOG's composite average wellhead NGLs price decreased 16% to $13.41 per barrel in 2020 compared to $16.03 per barrel in 2019.  NGL production in 2020 increased 1% to 136 MBbld as compared to 134 MBbld in 2019.  The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin, partially offset by decreased production in the Eagle Ford.\nWellhead natural gas revenues in 2020 decreased $347 million, or 29%, to $837 million from $1,184 million in 2019, primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price ($251 million) and a decrease in natural gas deliveries ($96 million).  EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 23% to $1.83 per Mcf in 2020 compared to $2.38 per Mcf in 2019.  Natural gas deliveries in 2020 decreased 8% to\n1,252\nMMcfd as compared to\n1,366\nMMcfd in 2019.  The decrease in production was primarily due to lower natural gas volumes in Trinidad, the Marcellus Shale and the Rocky Mountain area, partially offset by increased production of associated natural gas from the Permian Basin.\nDuring 2020, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $1,145 million, which included net cash received for settlements of crude oil, NGL and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $1,071 million.  During 2019, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $180 million, which included net cash received for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $231 million.\nGathering, processing and marketing revenues are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, as well as fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas and revenues from sales of EOG-owned sand.  Purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas may be utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities.  EOG sells sand in order to balance the timing of firm purchase agreements with completion operations and to utilize excess capacity at EOG-owned facilities.  Marketing costs represent the costs to purchase third-party crude oil, natural gas and sand and the associated transportation costs, as well as costs associated with EOG-owned sand sold to third parties.\nGathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2020 decreased $124 million compared to 2019, primarily due to lower margins on crude oil and condensate marketing activities.  The margin on crude oil marketing activities in 2020 was negatively impacted by the price decline for crude oil in inventory awaiting delivery to customers and EOG's decision early in the second quarter of 2020 to reduce commodity price volatility by selling May and June 2020 deliveries under fixed price arrangements.\n2019 compared to 2018.\nWellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2019 increased $96 million, or 1%, to $9,613 million from $9,517 million in 2018, due primarily to an increase in production ($1,351 million); partially offset by a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($1,255 million).  EOG's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2019 decreased 11% to $57.72 per barrel compared to $65.21 per barrel in 2018.  Wellhead crude oil and condensate production in 2019 increased 14% to 456 MBbld as compared to 400 MBbld in 2018.  The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford.\nNGLs revenues in 2019 decreased $343 million, or 30%, to $784 million from $1,127 million in 2018 primarily due to a lower composite average wellhead NGLs price ($518 million), partially offset by an increase in production ($175 million).  EOG's composite average wellhead NGLs price decreased 40% to $16.03 per barrel in 2019 compared to $26.60 per barrel in 2018.  NGL production in 2019 increased 16% to 134 MBbld as compared to 116 MBbld in 2018.  The increased production was primarily in the Permian Basin.\nWellhead natural gas revenues in 2019 decreased $118 million, or 9%, to $1,184 million from $1,302 million in 2018, primarily due to a lower composite wellhead natural gas price ($280 million), partially offset by an increase in natural gas deliveries ($162 million).  EOG's composite average wellhead natural gas price decreased 18% to $2.38 per Mcf in 2019 compared to $2.92 per Mcf in 2018.  Natural gas deliveries in 2019 increased 12% to 1,366 MMcfd as compared to 1,219 MMcfd in 2018.  The increase in production was primarily due to higher deliveries in the United States resulting from increased production of associated natural gas from the Permian Basin and higher natural gas volumes in South Texas.\n38\nDuring 2019, EOG recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $180 million, which included net cash received for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $231 million.  During 2018, EOG recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $166 million, which included net cash paid for settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $259 million.\nGathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2019 decreased $18 million compared to 2018, primarily due to lower margins on crude oil and condensate marketing activities, partially offset by higher margins on natural gas marketing activities.\nOperating and Other Expenses\n2020 compared to 2019\n.  During 2020, operating expenses of $11,576 million were $2,105 million lower than the $13,681 million incurred during 2019.\nThe following table presents the costs per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n(1)\nTotal excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.\nThe primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2020 compared to 2019 are set forth below.  See \"Operating Revenues and Other\" above for a discussion of production volumes.\nLease and well expenses include expenses for EOG-operated properties, as well as expenses billed to EOG from other operators where EOG is not the operator of a property.  Lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories: costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells, the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses.  Operating and maintenance costs include, among other things, pumping services, salt water disposal, equipment repair and maintenance, compression expense, lease upkeep and fuel and power.  Workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells.\nEach of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as EOG attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations.  EOG continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas.  Operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to EOG by vendors, fluctuate over time.\nLease and well expenses of $1,063 million in 2020 decreased $304 million from $1,367 million in 2019 primarily due to lower operating and maintenance costs in the United States ($157 million) and in Canada ($25 million), lower workovers expenditures in the United States ($103 million) and lower lease and well administrative expenses in the United States ($12 million).  Lease and well expenses decreased in the United States primarily due to decreased operating activities resulting from decreased production, efficiency improvements and service cost reductions.\nTransportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease or an aggregation point on EOG's gathering system to a downstream point of sale.  Transportation costs include transportation fees, the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), the cost of dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees and fuel costs.\n39\nTransportation costs of $735 million in 2020 decreased $23 million from $758 million in 2019 primarily due to decreased transportation costs in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale ($27 million), the Rocky Mountain area ($24 million) and the Eagle Ford ($20 million), partially offset by increased transportation costs in the Permian Basin ($56 million).\nDD&A of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method.  EOG's DD&A rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual DD&A group calculations.  There are several factors that can impact EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and impairments.  Changes to these factors may cause EOG's composite DD&A rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period.  DD&A of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets.\nDD&A expenses in 2020 decreased $350 million to $3,400 million from $3,750 million in 2019.  DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2020 were $390 million lower than in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in production in the United States ($222 million) and Trinidad ($22 million) and lower unit rates in the United States ($150 million).  Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.  DD&A expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment in 2020 were $40 million higher than in 2019 primarily due to an increase in expense related to gathering and storage assets and equipment.\nG&A expenses of $484 million in 2020 decreased $5 million from $489 million in 2019 primarily due to decreased employee-related expenses ($43 million) and professional and other services ($7 million), partially offset by idle equipment and termination fees ($46 million).\nNet interest expense of $205 million in 2020 was $20 million higher than 2019 primarily due to the issuance of the Notes in April 2020 ($51 million) and lower capitalized interest ($7 million), partially offset by repayment in June 2019 of the $900 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2019 ($21 million), repayment in June 2020 of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.40% Senior Notes due 2020 ($13 million) and repayment in April 2020 of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.45% Senior Notes due 2020 ($10 million).\nGathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating EOG's gathering and processing assets as well as natural gas processing fees and certain NGLs fractionation fees paid to third parties.  EOG pays third parties to process the majority of its natural gas production to extract NGLs.\nGathering and processing costs decreased $20 million to $459 million in 2020 compared to $479 million in 2019 primarily due to decreased operating costs in the Eagle Ford ($16 million) and decreased gathering and processing fees in the Eagle Ford ($9 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale ($5 million); partially offset by increased gathering and processing fees in the Permian Basin ($15 million).\nExploration costs of $146 million in 2020 increased $6 million from $140 million in 2019 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the United States ($15 million), partially offset by decreased general and administrative expenses in the United States ($8 million).\nImpairments include: amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets.  Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term.  Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment.  When circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a DD&A group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset.  If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimates of (and assumptions regarding) future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value.  Fair value is generally calculated by using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).  In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value.\n40\nThe following table represents impairments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\nImpairments of proved properties were primarily due to the write-down to fair value of legacy and non-core natural gas and crude oil and combo plays in 2020 and legacy natural gas assets in 2019.\nTaxes other than income include severance/production taxes, ad valorem/property taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes.  Severance/production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues, and ad valorem/property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets.\nTaxes other than income in 2020 decreased $322 million to $478 million (6.6% of wellhead revenues) from $800 million (6.9% of wellhead revenues) in 2019.  The decrease in taxes other than income was primarily due to decreased severance/production taxes in the United States ($232 million), decreased ad valorem/property taxes in the United States ($51 million) and a state severance tax refund ($27 million).\nOther income, net, was $10 million in 2020 compared to other income, net, of $31 million in 2019.  The decrease of $21 million in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in interest income.\nIn response to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the President of the United States signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) into law on March 27, 2020.  The CARES Act provides economic support to individuals and businesses through enhanced loan programs, expanded unemployment benefits, and certain payroll and income tax relief, among other provisions.  The primary tax benefit of the CARES Act for EOG was the acceleration of approximately $150 million of additional refundable alternative minimum tax (AMT) credits into tax year 2019.  These credits originated from AMT paid by EOG in years prior to 2018 and were reflected as a deferred tax asset and a non-current receivable as of December 31, 2019 since they had been expected to either offset future current tax liabilities or be refunded on a declining balance schedule through 2021.  The $150 million of additional refundable AMT credits was received in July 2020.\nFurther pandemic relief was contained in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (the CA Act) which was signed into law by the President of the United States on December 27, 2020.  In addition, the CA Act provided government funding and limited corporate income tax relief primarily related to making permanent or extending certain tax provisions, none of which were a material benefit for EOG.\nEOG recognized an income tax benefit of $135 million in 2020 compared to an income tax provision of $810 million in 2019, primarily due to decreased pretax income.  The net effective tax rate for 2020 decreased to 18% from 23% in 2019.  The lower effective tax rate is mostly due to taxes attributable to EOG's foreign operations and increased stock-based compensation tax deficiencies.\n41\n2019 compared to 2018\n.  During 2019, operating expenses of $13,681 million were $875 million higher than the $12,806 million incurred during 2018.\nThe following table presents the costs per Boe for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n(1)\nTotal excludes gathering and processing costs, exploration costs, dry hole costs, impairments, marketing costs and taxes other than income.\nThe primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, DD&A, G&A and net interest expense for 2019 compared to 2018 are set forth below.  See \"Operating Revenues and Other\" above for a discussion of production volumes.\nLease and well expenses of $1,367 million in 2019 increased $84 million from $1,283 million in 2018 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs ($76 million) and higher lease and well administrative expenses ($29 million) in the United States, partially offset by lower operating and maintenance costs in the United Kingdom ($15 million) due to the sale of operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in Canada ($11 million).  Lease and well expenses increased in the United States primarily due to increased operating activities resulting in increased production.\nTransportation costs of $758 million in 2019 increased $11 million from $747 million in 2018 primarily due to increased transportation costs in the Permian Basin ($91 million) and South Texas ($11 million), partially offset by decreased transportation costs in the Eagle Ford ($77 million) and the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale ($13 million).\nDD&A expenses in 2019 increased $315 million to $3,750 million from $3,435 million in 2018.  DD&A expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2019 were $337 million higher than in 2018 primarily due to an increase in production in the United States ($489 million), partially offset by lower unit rates in the United States ($119 million) and the sale of the United Kingdom operations in the fourth quarter of 2018 ($33 million).  Unit rates in the United States decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.\nG&A expenses of $489 million in 2019 increased $62 million from $427 million in 2018 primarily due to increased employee-related expenses ($48 million) and increased information systems costs ($8 million) resulting from expanded operations.\nNet interest expense of $185 million in 2019 was $60 million lower than 2018 primarily due to repayment of the $900 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2019 in June 2019 ($30 million) and the $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6.875% Senior Notes due 2018 in October 2018 ($18 million) and an increase in capitalized interest ($14 million).\nGathering and processing costs increased $42 million to $479 million in 2019 compared to $437 million in 2018 primarily due to increased operating costs and fees in the Permian Basin ($52 million), the Rocky Mountain area ($13 million) and South Texas ($5 million); partially offset by decreased operating costs in the United Kingdom ($33 million) due to the sale of operations in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nExploration costs of $140 million in 2019 decreased $9 million from $149 million in 2018 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the Trinidad ($17 million), partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses in the United States ($7 million).\n42\nThe following table represents impairments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):\nImpairments of proved properties were primarily due to the write-down to fair value of legacy natural gas assets in 2019 and 2018.\nTaxes other than income in 2019 increased $28 million to $800 million (6.9% of wellhead revenues) from $772 million (6.5% of wellhead revenues) in 2018.  The increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to an increase in ad valorem/property taxes ($53 million), partially offset by an increase in credits available to EOG in 2019 for state incentive severance tax rate reductions ($12 million) and a decrease in severance/production taxes ($12 million) primarily as a result of decreased wellhead revenues, all in the United States.\nOther income, net, was $31 million in 2019 compared to other income, net, of $17 million in 2018.  The increase of $14 million in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in interest income ($14 million) and an increase in foreign currency transaction gains ($9 million), partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation expense ($4 million).\nEOG recognized an income tax provision of $810 million in 2019 compared to an income tax provision of $822 million in 2018, primarily due to decreased pretax income, partially offset by the absence of tax benefits from certain tax reform measurement-period adjustments.  The net effective tax rate for 2019 increased to 23% from 19% in the prior year, primarily due to the absence of tax benefits from certain tax reform measurement-period adjustments.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nCash Flow\nThe primary sources of cash for EOG during the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, were funds generated from operations, net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts and proceeds from asset sales.  The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; repayments of debt; dividend payments to stockholders and other property, plant and equipment expenditures.\n2020 compared to 2019.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $5,008 million in 2020 decreased $3,155 million from $8,163 million in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in wellhead revenues ($4,291 million); unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($166 million); a decrease in gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs ($124 million) and an increase in net cash paid for income taxes ($86 million); partially offset by an increase in cash received for settlements of commodity derivative contracts ($840 million) and a decrease in cash operating expenses ($641 million).\nNet cash used in investing activities of $3,348 million in 2020 decreased by $2,829 million from $6,177 million in 2019 primarily due to a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($2,908 million); an increase in proceeds from the sale of assets ($52 million); a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($49 million); and a decrease in other investing activities ($10 million); partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital associated with investing activities ($190 million).\nNet cash used in financing activities of $359 million in 2020 included repayments of long-term debt ($1,000 million), cash dividend payments ($821 million), repayment of finance lease liabilities ($19 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($16 million).  Cash provided by financing activities in 2020 included long-term debt borrowings ($1,484 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($16 million).\n43\n2019 compared to 2018.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $8,163 million in 2019 increased $394 million from $7,769 million in 2018 primarily reflecting an increase in cash received for settlements of commodity derivative contracts ($490 million), a decrease in net cash paid for income taxes ($367 million) and favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($122 million); partially offset by a decrease in wellhead revenues ($365 million) and an increase in cash operating expenses ($202 million).\nNet cash used in investing activities of $6,177 million in 2019 increased by $7 million from $6,170 million in 2018 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($313 million), a decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets ($87 million) and an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($33 million); partially offset by favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($416 million) and a decrease in other investing activities ($10 million).\nNet cash used in financing activities of $1,513 million in 2019 included repayments of long-term debt ($900 million), cash dividend payments ($588 million) and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($25 million).  Cash provided by financing activities in 2019 included proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($18 million).\nTotal Expenditures\nThe table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):\n(1)\nLeasehold acquisitions included $197 million, $98 million and $291 million related to non-cash property exchanges in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(2)\nProperty acquisitions included $15 million, $52 million and $71 million related to non-cash property exchanges in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(3)\nOther property, plant and equipment included non-cash additions of $174 million, primarily related to finance lease transactions for storage facilities, and $49 million, primarily related to a finance lease transaction in the Permian Basin, in 2020 and 2018, respectively.\n44\nExploration and development expenditures of $3,601 million for 2020 were $2,841 million lower than the prior year.   The decrease was primarily due to decreased exploration and development drilling expenditures in the United States ($2,309 million), decreased facilities expenditures ($282 million) and decreased property acquisitions ($245 million), partially offset by increased exploration and development drilling expenditures in Trinidad ($27 million).  The 2020 exploration and development expenditures of $3,601 million included $2,905 million in development drilling and facilities, $530 million in exploration, $135 million in property acquisitions and $31 million in capitalized interest.  The 2019 exploration and development expenditures of $6,442 million included $5,513 million in development drilling and facilities, $511 million in exploration, $380 million in property acquisitions and $38 million in capitalized interest.  The 2018 exploration and development expenditures of $6,350 million included $5,546 million in development drilling and facilities, $656 million in exploration, $124 million in property acquisitions and $24 million in capitalized interest.\nThe level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other economic factors.  EOG believes it has significant flexibility and availability with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant.  While EOG has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of EOG.\nCommodity Derivative Transactions\nCrude Oil Derivative Contracts.\nPrices received by EOG for its crude oil production generally vary from U.S. New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices due to adjustments for delivery location (basis) and other factors. EOG has entered into crude oil basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) Brent pricing and pricing in Cushing, Oklahoma (ICE Brent Differential). Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's ICE Brent Differential basis swap contracts through February 18, 2021. The weighted average price differential expressed in $/Bbl represents the amount of addition to Cushing, Oklahoma, prices for the notional volumes expressed in Bbld covered by the basis swap contracts.\nEOG has also entered into crude oil basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between pricing in Houston, Texas, and Cushing, Oklahoma (Houston Differential). Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's Houston Differential basis swap contracts through February 18, 2021. The weighted average price differential expressed in $/Bbl represents the amount of addition to Cushing, Oklahoma, prices for the notional volumes expressed in Bbld covered by the basis swap contracts.\n45\nEOG has also entered into crude oil swaps in order to fix the differential in pricing between the NYMEX calendar month average and the physical crude oil delivery month (Roll Differential). Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's Roll Differential basis swap contracts through February 18, 2021. The weighted average price differential expressed in $/Bbl represents the amount of net addition (reduction) to delivery month prices for the notional volumes expressed in Bbld covered by the swap contracts.\nIn May 2020, EOG entered into crude oil Roll Differential basis swap contracts for the period from July 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020, with notional volumes of 22,000 Bbld at a weighted average price differential of $(0.43) per Bbl, and for the period from October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, with notional volumes of 44,000 Bbld at a weighted average price differential of $(0.73) per Bbl. These contracts partially offset certain outstanding Roll Differential basis swap contracts for the same time periods and volumes at a weighted average price differential of $(1.16) per Bbl. EOG paid net cash of $3.2 million for the settlement of these contracts. The offsetting contracts were excluded from the above table.\nPresented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's crude oil NYMEX WTI price swap contracts through February 18, 2021, with notional volumes expressed in Bbld and prices expressed in $/Bbl.\n46\nIn April and May 2020, EOG entered into crude oil NYMEX WTI price swap contracts for the period from June 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020, with notional volumes of 265,000 Bbld at a weighted average price of $33.80 per Bbl, for the period from July 1, 2020 through July 31, 2020, with notional volumes of 254,000 Bbld at a weighted average price of $33.75 per Bbl, for the period from August 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020, with notional volumes of 154,000 Bbld at a weighted average price of $34.18 per Bbl and for the period from October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, with notional volumes of 47,000 Bbld at a weighted average price of $30.04 per Bbl. These contracts offset the remaining crude oil NYMEX WTI price swap contracts for the same time periods and volumes at a weighted average price of $51.36 per Bbl for the period from June 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020, $42.36 per Bbl for the period from July 1, 2020 through July 31, 2020, $50.42 per Bbl for the period from August 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020 and $31.00 per Bbl for the period from October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020.  EOG received net cash of $364.0 million for the settlement of these contracts. The offsetting contracts were excluded from the above table.\nPresented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's crude oil ICE Brent price swap contracts through February 18, 2021, with notional volumes expressed in Bbld and prices expressed in $/Bbl.\nNGLs Derivative Contracts.\nPresented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's Mont Belvieu propane (non-TET) price swap contracts through February 18, 2021, with notional volumes expressed in Bbld and prices expressed in $/Bbl.\nIn April and May 2020, EOG entered into Mont Belvieu propane price swap contracts for the period from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, with notional volumes of 25,000 Bbld at a weighted average price of $16.41 per Bbl. These contracts offset the remaining Mont Belvieu propane price swap contracts for the same time period with notional volumes of 25,000 Bbld at a weighted average price of $17.92 per Bbl. EOG received net cash of $9.2 million for the settlement of these contracts.

Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's Waha Differential basis swap contracts through February 18, 2021.  The weighted average price differential expressed in $/MMBtu represents the amount of reduction to NYMEX Henry Hub prices for the notional volumes expressed in MMBtud covered by the basis swap contracts.\nIn April 2020, EOG entered into Waha Differential basis swap contracts for the period from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, with notional volumes of 50,000 MMBtud at a weighted average price differential of $0.43 per MMBtu. These contracts offset the remaining Waha Differential basis swap contracts for the same time period with notional volumes of 50,000 MMBtud at a weighted average price differential of $1.40 per MMBtu. EOG paid net cash of $11.9 million for the settlement of these contracts. The offsetting contracts were excluded from the above table.\nFinancing\nEOG's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 22% at December 31, 2020, compared to 19% at December 31, 2019.  As used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, EOG had outstanding $5,640 million and $5,140 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which had estimated fair values of $6,505 million and $5,452 million, respectively.  The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to EOG at year-end.  EOG's debt is at fixed interest rates.  While changes in interest rates affect the fair value of EOG's senior notes, such changes do not expose EOG to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow.\nDuring 2020, EOG funded its capital program and operations primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities, issuance of the Notes and proceeds from asset sales.  While EOG maintains a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility to back its commercial paper program, there were no borrowings outstanding at any time during 2020 and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero.  EOG considers the availability of its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, as described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements, to be sufficient to meet its ongoing operating needs.\n50\n51\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes EOG's contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 (in millions):\n(1)\nThis table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, EOG's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see Notes 6, 7 and 15, respectively, to Consolidated Financial Statements).  These amounts are excluded because they are subject to estimates and the timing of settlement is unknown.\n(2)\nFor more information on contracts that meet the definition of a lease under ASU 2016-02, see Note 18 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(3)\nAmounts exclude transportation and storage service commitments that meet the definition of a lease.  Amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert Canadian dollars into United States dollars at December 31, 2020.  Management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of EOG.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nEOG does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships.  Such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (VIE) or special purpose entities (SPE), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. EOG was not involved in any unconsolidated VIE or SPE financial transactions or any other \"off-balance sheet arrangement\" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nDuring 2020, EOG was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including Trinidad, China and Canada.  EOG continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk.\n52\nOutlook\nPricing.\nCrude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue.  As a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, worldwide supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, EOG is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future.  The market price of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in 2021 will impact the amount of cash generated from EOG's operating activities, which will in turn impact EOG's financial position.  As of February 18, 2021, the average 2021 NYMEX crude oil and natural gas prices were $57.51 per barrel and $2.98 per MMBtu, respectively, representing an increase of 46% for crude oil and an increase of  43% for natural gas from the average NYMEX prices in 2020.  See ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.\nIncluding the impact of EOG's crude oil and NGL derivative contracts (exclusive of basis swaps) and based on EOG's tax position, EOG's price sensitivity in 2021 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in NGL price, is approximately $99 million for net income and $127 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities.  Including the impact of EOG's natural gas derivative contracts and based on EOG's tax position and the portion of EOG's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2021 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, EOG's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per Mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $31 million for net income and $40 million for pretax cash flows from operating activities.  For information regarding EOG's crude oil, NGLs and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts through February 18, 2021, see \"Commodity Derivative Transactions\" above.\nCapital.\nEOG plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the United States.  In particular, EOG will be focused on United States crude oil drilling activity in its Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford and Rocky Mountain area where it generates its highest rates-of-return.  To further enhance the economics of these plays, EOG expects to continue to improve well performance and lower drilling and completion costs through efficiency gains and lower service costs.  In addition, EOG expects to spend a portion of its anticipated 2021 capital expenditures on leasing acreage and evaluating new prospects.\nThe total anticipated 2021 capital expenditures of approximately $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, excluding acquisitions and non-cash transactions, is structured to maintain EOG's strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration, development\nand exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand.  EOG has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings.\nOperations.\nIn 2021, total crude oil production is expected to remain at fourth quarter 2020 levels.  In 2021, EOG expects to continue to focus on reducing operating costs through efficiency improvements.\n53\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies\nEOG prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.  EOG identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on EOG's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their application.  Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown.  Management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies.  Following is a discussion of EOG's most critical accounting policies:\nProved Oil and Gas Reserves\nEOG's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties and related assets.  Proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made.  The process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.  The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.  Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time.  For related discussion, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, and \"Supplemental Information to Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\nOil and Gas Exploration and Development Costs\nEOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting.  Oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are expensed as incurred.  The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered commercial quantities of proved reserves.  If commercial quantities of proved reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed.  In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether commercial quantities of proved reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed.  Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the estimated reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made.  Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization for Oil and Gas Properties\nThe quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of EOG's calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. Holding all other factors constant, if reserves are revised upward or downward, earnings will increase or decrease, respectively.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method.  The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves.  With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves.  Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account.\nOil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC.  The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and impairments.\n54\nDepreciation and amortization of other property, plant and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.\nImpairments\nOil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred.  Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term.  Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment.  If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties.  Lease rentals are expensed as incurred.\nWhen circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset.  If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimates of (and assumptions regarding) future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value.  Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the ASC.  In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value.  Estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment, and the assumptions used in preparing such estimates are inherently uncertain.  In addition, such assumptions and estimates are reasonably likely to change in the future.\nCrude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and EOG expects that volatility to continue in the future.  During the five years ended December 31, 2020, WTI crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $(36.98) per barrel to $77.41 per barrel, and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $1.33 per MMBtu to $6.24 per MMBtu.  Market prices for NGLs are influenced by the components extracted, including ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline, among others, and the respective market pricing for each component.\nEOG uses the five-year NYMEX futures strip for WTI crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas and the five-year Oil Price Information Services futures strip for NGLs components (in each case as of the applicable balance sheet date) as a basis to estimate future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices.  EOG's proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available.  Proved reserves are estimated using a trailing 12-month average price, in accordance with SEC rules.  In the future, if any combination of crude oil prices, NGLs prices, natural gas prices, actual production or operating costs diverge negatively from EOG's current estimates, impairment charges and downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves may be necessary.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach.  Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.  EOG assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate.  Significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices and levels of capital reinvestment.  Changes in such assumptions or changes in tax laws and regulations could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn accounting for stock-based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies.  Assumptions regarding expected volatility of EOG's common stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on EOG's common stock, the expected term of the awards, expected volatility in the price of shares and composition of EOG's peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change.  Any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.\n55\nInformation Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, goals, returns and rates of return, budgets, reserves, levels of production, capital expenditures, costs and asset sales, statements regarding future commodity prices and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward‐looking statements.  EOG typically uses words such as \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"strategy,\" \"intend,“ \"plan,\" \"target,\" \"aims,\" \"goal,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"focused on,\" \"should\" and \"believe\" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward‐looking statements.  In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production, generate returns and rates of return, replace or increase drilling locations, reduce or otherwise control operating costs and capital expenditures, generate cash flows, pay down or refinance indebtedness, or pay and/or increase dividends are forward‐looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance.  Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct.  Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known, unknown or currently unforeseen risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control.  Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others:\n•\nthe timing, extent and duration of changes in prices for, supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas and related commodities;\n•\nthe extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to acquire or discover additional reserves;\n•\nthe extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to (i) economically develop its acreage in, (ii) produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels and rates of return from, (iii) decrease or otherwise control its drilling, completion, operating and capital costs related to, and (iv) maximize reserve recovery from, its existing and future crude oil and natural gas exploration and development projects and associated potential and existing drilling locations;\n•\nthe extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to market its production of crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, and natural gas;\n•\nsecurity threats, including cybersecurity threats and disruptions to our business and operations from breaches of our information technology systems, physical breaches of our facilities and other infrastructure or breaches of the information technology systems, facilities and infrastructure of third parties with which we transact business;\n•\nthe availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, appropriate gathering, processing, compression, storage, transportation, refining, and export facilities;\n•\nthe availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights-of-way, and EOG's ability to retain mineral licenses and leases;\n•\nthe impact of, and changes in, government policies, laws and regulations, including any changes or other actions which may result from the recent U.S. elections and change in U.S. administration and including tax laws and regulations; climate change and other environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to air emissions, disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, hydraulic fracturing and access to and use of water; laws and regulations affecting the leasing of acreage and permitting for oil and gas drilling and the calculation of royalty payments in respect of oil and gas production; laws and regulations imposing additional permitting and disclosure requirements, additional operating restrictions and conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil and natural gas; laws and regulations with respect to derivatives and hedging activities; and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil, natural gas and related commodities;\n•\nEOG's ability to effectively integrate acquired crude oil and natural gas properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and drilling, completing and operating costs with respect to such properties;\n•\nthe extent to which EOG's third-party-operated crude oil and natural gas properties are operated successfully and economically;\n•\ncompetition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for the acquisition of licenses, leases and properties, employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials and services;\n•\nthe availability and cost of employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials (such as water and tubulars) and services;\n•\nthe accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise;\n56\n•\nweather, including its impact on crude oil and natural gas demand, and weather-related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation (by EOG or third parties) of production, gathering, processing, refining, compression, storage, transportation, and export facilities;\n•\nthe ability of EOG's customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG;\n•\nEOG's ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all, and to otherwise satisfy its capital expenditure requirements;\n•\nthe extent to which EOG is successful in its completion of planned asset dispositions;\n•\nthe extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG;\n•\nthe timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions;\n•\nthe duration and economic and financial impact of epidemics, pandemics or other public health issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic;\n•\ngeopolitical factors and political conditions and developments around the world (such as the imposition of tariffs or trade or other economic sanctions, political instability and armed conflict), including in the areas in which EOG operates;\n•\nthe use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources;\n•\nthe extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities or losses and liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage;\n•\nacts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; and\n•\nthe other factors described under ITEM 1A, Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any updates to those factors set forth in EOG's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.\nIn light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the duration or extent of their impact on our actual results.  Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOG's forward-looking statements. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise."

EOG's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information that is required to be disclosed in the reports EOG files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to EOG's management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.  Based on that evaluation, EOG's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that EOG's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020.\n57\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nEOG's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act).  Even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, circumvention of controls or overriding of controls and, therefore, can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to reliable financial reporting.  Furthermore, the effectiveness of a system of internal control over financial reporting in future periods can change as conditions change.\nEOG's management assessed the effectiveness of EOG's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.  In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013).\nBased on this assessment and such criteria, EOG's management believes that EOG's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.  See also \"Management's Responsibility for Financial Reporting\" appearing on page F-2 of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nThe report of EOG's independent registered public accounting firm relating to the consolidated financial statements and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is set forth on page F-3 of this report.\nThere were no changes in EOG's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, EOG's internal control over financial reporting."

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) was approved to increase the shares available for grant by 2.0 million shares.  The ESPP was originally approved by EOG's stockholders in 2001, and would have expired on July 1, 2011.  The amendment also extended the term of the ESPP to December 31, 2019, unless terminated earlier by its terms or by EOG.  At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in April 2018, stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of the ESPP to (among other changes) increase the number of shares available for grant by 2.5 million shares and further extend the term of the ESPP to December 31, 2027, unless terminated earlier by its terms or by EOG.\nStock Plans Not Approved by EOG Stockholders.\nIn December 2008, the Board approved the amendment and continuation of the 1996 Deferral Plan as the \"EOG Resources, Inc. 409A Deferred Compensation Plan\" (Deferral Plan).  Under the Deferral Plan (as subsequently amended), payment of up to 50% of base salary and 100% of annual cash bonus, director's fees, vestings of restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors (and dividends credited thereon) under the 2008 Plan and 401(k) refunds (as defined in the Deferral Plan) may be deferred into a phantom stock account. In the phantom stock account, deferrals are treated as if shares of EOG common stock were purchased at the closing stock price on the date of deferral.  Dividends are credited quarterly and treated as if reinvested in EOG common stock.  Payment of the phantom stock account is made in actual shares of EOG common stock in accordance with the Deferral Plan and the individual's deferral election.  A total of 540,000 shares of EOG common stock have been authorized by the Board and registered for issuance under the Deferral Plan.  As of December 31, 2020, 368,745 phantom shares had been issued.  The Deferral Plan is currently EOG's only stock plan that has not been approved by EOG's stockholders.\n59\nThe following table sets forth data for EOG's equity compensation plans aggregated by the various plans approved by EOG's stockholders and those plans not approved by EOG's stockholders, in each case as of December 31, 2020.\n(1)\nThe weighted-average exercise price is calculated based solely on the exercise prices of the outstanding stock option and SAR grants and does not reflect shares that will be issued upon the vesting of outstanding restricted stock unit and performance unit grants, or Deferral Plan phantom shares, all of which have no exercise price.\n(2)\nAmount includes 954,949 outstanding restricted stock units, for which shares of EOG common stock will be issued, on a one-for-one basis, upon the vesting of such grants.  Amount also includes 612,951 outstanding performance units and assumes, for purposes of this table, (i) the application of a 100% performance multiple upon the completion of each of the remaining performance periods in respect of such performance unit grants and (ii) accordingly, the issuance, on a one-for-one basis, of an aggregate 612,951 shares of EOG common stock upon the vesting of such grants.  As more fully discussed in Note 7 to Consolidated Financial Statements, upon the application of the relevant performance multiple at the completion of each of the remaining performance periods in respect of such grants, (A) a minimum of 76,785 and a maximum of 1,149,117 performance units could be outstanding and (B) accordingly, a minimum of 76,785 and a maximum of 1,149,117 shares of EOG common stock could be issued upon the vesting of such grants.\n(3)\nConsists of (i) 1,996,101 shares remaining available for issuance under the Amended and Restated 2008 Plan and (ii) 1,895,443 shares remaining available for purchase under the ESPP.  Pursuant to the fungible share design of the Amended and Restated 2008 Plan, each share issued as a SAR or stock option under the Amended and Restated 2008 Plan counts as 1.0 share against the aggregate plan share limit, and each share issued as a \"full value award\" (i.e., as restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance units) counts as 2.45 shares against the aggregate plan share limit.  Thus, from the 1,996,101 shares remaining available for issuance under the Amended and Restated 2008 Plan, (i) the maximum number of shares we could issue as SAR and stock option awards is 1,996,101 (i.e., if all shares remaining available for issuance under the Amended and Restated 2008 Plan are issued as SAR and stock option awards) and (ii) the maximum number of shares we could issue as full value awards is 814,735 (i.e., if all shares remaining available for issuance under the Amended and Restated 2008 Plan are issued as full value awards).\n(4)\nConsists of shares of EOG common stock to be issued in accordance with the Deferral Plan and participant deferral elections (i.e., in respect of the 248,363 phantom shares issued and outstanding under the Deferral Plan as of December 31, 2020).\n(5)\nRepresents phantom shares that remain available for issuance under the Deferral Plan."

Their report appears on page F-3.\nF-2\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of\nEOG Resources, Inc.\nHouston, Texas\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of EOG Resources, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nF-3\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nProved Oil and Gas Properties and Depletion and Impairment – Crude Oil and Condensate, NGLs, and Natural Gas Reserves —Refer to Notes 1, 13 and 14 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s proved oil and natural gas properties are depleted using the units of production method and are evaluated for impairment by comparison to the future net cash flows of the underlying proved crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas reserves. The development of the Company’s crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserve volumes and the related future net cash flows requires management to make significant estimates and scheduling assumptions related to the five-year development plan for proved undeveloped reserves, future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices, and future well costs. The Company’s reserve engineers estimate crude oil, NGLs and natural gas quantities using these estimates and assumptions and engineering data. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the amount of depletion and any proved oil and gas impairment. Proved oil and gas properties were $23 billion as of December 31, 2020, and depletion and proved property impairment were $3.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, for the year then ended.\nGiven the significant judgments made by management, performing audit procedures to evaluate the Company’s proved crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserve quantities and the related future net cash flows including management’s estimates and assumptions related to the five-year development plan, future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices and future well costs, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s estimates and assumptions related to crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserve quantities and estimates of future net cash flows included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the Company’s estimation of proved crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserve quantities and related future net cash flows, including controls relating to the five-year development plan, future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices and future well costs\n.\n•\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management’s five-year development plan by comparing the forecasts to:\n◦\nHistorical conversions of proved undeveloped reserves.\n◦\nInternal communications to management and the Board of Directors.\n◦\nApproval for expenditures.\n◦\nAnalyst and industry reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies.\n•\nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated management’s estimated future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices by:\n◦\nUnderstanding the methodology used by management for development of the future prices and comparing the estimated prices to an independently determined range of prices.\n◦\nComparing management’s estimates to published forward pricing indices and third-party industry sources.\n◦\nEvaluating the historical realized price differentials incorporated in the future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices.\nF-4\n•\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of capital expenditures (well costs) by comparing the estimate to:\n◦\nHistorical development of similar wells drilled.\n◦\nAnalyst and industry reports.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s oil and natural gas reserve volumes by:\n◦\nComparing the Company’s reserve volumes to historical production volumes.\n◦\nComparing the Company’s reserve volumes to those independently developed by the independent petroleum consultants.\n◦\nEvaluating the reasonableness of the production volume decline curves.\n◦\nUnderstanding the experience, qualifications, and objectivity of the Company’s reserve engineers and the independent petroleum consultants.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 25, 2021\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.\nF-5\nEOG RESOURCES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (LOSS) AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\n(In Thousands, Except Per Share Data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nF-6\nEOG RESOURCES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In Thousands, Except Share Data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nF-7\nEOG RESOURCES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n(In Thousands, Except Per Share Data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nF-8\nEOG RESOURCES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In Thousands)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nF-9\nEOG RESOURCES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation.\nThe consolidated financial statements of EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) include the accounts of all domestic and foreign subsidiaries.  Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, in which EOG is able to exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method.  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nFinancial Instruments.\nEOG's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, commodity derivative contracts, accounts receivable, accounts payable and current and long-term debt.  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, commodity derivative contracts, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value (see Notes 2 and 12).\nEffective January 1, 2020, EOG adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, \"Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\" (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 changes the impairment model for financial assets and certain other instruments by requiring entities to adopt a forward-looking expected loss model that will result in earlier recognition of credit losses. EOG elected to adopt ASU 2016-13 using the modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. Financial results reported in periods prior to January 1, 2020, are unchanged. EOG assessed its applicable financial assets, which are primarily its accounts receivable from hydrocarbon sales and joint interest billings to third-party companies, including foreign state-owned entities in the oil and gas industry. Based on its assessment and various potential remedies ensuring collection, EOG did not record an impact to retained earnings upon adoption and expects current and future credit losses to be immaterial. EOG continues to monitor the credit risk from third-party companies to determine if expected credit losses may become material.\nCash and Cash Equivalents.\nEOG records as cash equivalents all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nOil and Gas Operations.\nEOG accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting.\nOil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred. Unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term.  Unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are reviewed individually for impairment.  If the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties.  Lease rentals are expensed as incurred.\nOil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are expensed as incurred.  The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether EOG has discovered commercial quantities of proved reserves.  If commercial quantities of proved reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed.  In some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether commercial quantities of proved reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed.  Such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the estimated reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made (see Note 16).  Costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized.\nF-10\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method.  The reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves.  With respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves.  Estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account.\nOil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).  The basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.\nAmortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect: 1) the addition of capital costs, 2) reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, 3) property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and 4) impairments.\nWhen circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset.  If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimate of (and assumptions regarding) future crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value.  Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the ASC.  In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value.\nInventories, consisting primarily of tubular goods, materials for completion operations and well equipment held for use in the exploration for, and development and production of, crude oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves, are carried at the lower of cost and net realizable value with adjustments made, as appropriate, to recognize any reductions in value.\nRevenue Recognition.\nEffective January 1, 2018, EOG adopted the provisions of ASU 2014-09, \"Revenue From Contracts With Customers\" (ASU 2014-09).  ASU 2014-09 and other related ASUs require entities to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  EOG elected to adopt ASU 2014-09 using the modified retrospective approach, which required EOG to recognize in retained earnings the cumulative effect at the date of adoption for all existing contracts with customers which were not substantially complete as of January 1, 2018.  There was no impact to retained earnings upon adoption of ASU 2014-09.\nEOG presents disaggregated revenues by type of commodity within its Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and by geographic areas defined as operating segments. See Note 11.\nIn connection with the adoption of ASU 2014-09, EOG presents natural gas processing fees relating to certain processing and marketing agreements within its United States segment as Gathering and Processing Costs, instead of as a deduction to Revenues within its Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  There was no impact to operating income, net income or cash flows resulting from changes to the presentation of natural gas processing fees.\nThe impacts of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 for the year ended December 31, 2018, were as follows (in thousands):\nF-11\nRevenues are recognized for the sale of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas at the point control of the product is transferred to the customer, typically when production is delivered and title or risk of loss transfers to the customer.  Arrangements for such sales are evidenced by signed contracts with prices typically based on stated market indices, with certain adjustments for product quality and geographic location.  As EOG typically invoices customers shortly after performance obligations have been fulfilled, contract assets and contract liabilities are not recognized.  The balances of accounts receivable from contracts with customers as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and upon adoption of ASU 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018, were $\n1,337\nmillion, $\n1,619\nmillion and $\n1,460\nmillion, respectively, and were included in Accounts Receivable, Net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Losses incurred on receivables from contracts with customers are infrequent and have been immaterial.\nCrude Oil and Condensate.  EOG sells its crude oil and condensate production at the wellhead or further downstream at a contractually-specified delivery point.  Revenue is recognized when control transfers to the customer based on contract terms which reflect prevailing market prices.  Any costs incurred prior to the transfer of control, such as gathering and transportation, are recognized as Operating Expenses.\nNatural Gas Liquids.  EOG delivers certain of its natural gas production to either EOG-owned processing facilities or third-party processing facilities, where extraction of NGLs occurs.  For EOG-owned facilities, revenue is recognized after processing upon transfer of NGLs to a customer.  For third-party facilities, extracted NGLs are sold to the owner of the processing facility at the tailgate, or EOG takes possession and sells the extracted NGLs at the tailgate or exercises its option to sell further downstream to various customers.  Under typical arrangements for third-party facilities, revenue is recognized after processing upon the transfer of control of the NGLs, either at the tailgate of the processing plant or further downstream.  EOG recognizes revenues based on contract terms which reflect prevailing market prices, with processing fees recognized as Gathering and Processing Costs.\nNatural Gas.  EOG sells its natural gas production either at the wellhead or further downstream at a contractually-specified delivery point.  In connection with the extraction of NGLs, EOG sells residue gas under separate agreements.  Typically, EOG takes possession of the natural gas at the tailgate of the processing facility and sells it at the tailgate or further downstream.  In each case, EOG recognizes revenues when control transfers to the customer, based on contract terms which reflect prevailing market prices.\nF-12\nGathering, Processing and Marketing.  Gathering, processing and marketing revenues represent sales of third-party crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, as well as fees associated with gathering and processing third-party natural gas and revenues from sales of EOG-owned sand.  EOG evaluates whether it is the principal or agent under these transactions.  As control of the underlying commodity is transferred to EOG prior to the gathering, processing and marketing activities, EOG considers itself the principal of these arrangements.  Accordingly, EOG recognizes these transactions on a gross basis.  Purchases of third-party commodities are recorded as Marketing Costs, with sales of third-party commodities and fees received for gathering and processing recorded as Gathering, Processing and Marketing revenues.\nOther Property, Plant and Equipment\n.  Other property, plant and equipment consists of gathering and processing assets, compressors, buildings and leasehold improvements, sand processing assets, computer hardware and software, vehicles, and furniture and fixtures.  Other property, plant and equipment is generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the property, plant and equipment, which range from 3 years to 45 years.\nCapitalized Interest Costs.\nInterest costs have been capitalized as a part of the historical cost of unproved oil and gas properties.  The amount capitalized is an allocation of the interest cost incurred during the reporting period.  Capitalized interest is computed only during the exploration and development phases and ceases once production begins.  The interest rate used for capitalization purposes is based on the interest rates on EOG's outstanding borrowings.  The capitalization of interest is excluded on significant acquisitions of unproved oil and gas properties financed through non-interest-bearing instruments, such as the issuance of shares of Common Stock, or through non-cash property exchanges.\nAccounting for Risk Management Activities.\nDerivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value, and changes in the derivative's fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.  During the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, EOG elected not to designate any of its financial commodity derivative instruments as accounting hedges and, accordingly, changes in the fair value of these outstanding derivative instruments are recognized as gains or losses in the period of change.  The gains or losses are recorded as Gains (Losses) on Mark-to-Market Commodity Derivative Contracts on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  The related cash flow impact of settled contracts is reflected as cash flows from operating activities.  EOG employs net presentation of derivative assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes when such assets and liabilities are with the same counterparty and subject to a master netting arrangement.  See Note 12.\nIncome Taxes.\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach.  Under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.  EOG assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate.  See Note 6.\nForeign Currency Translation.\nThe United States dollar is the functional currency for all of EOG's consolidated subsidiaries except for its Canadian subsidiaries, for which the functional currency is the Canadian dollar, and its United Kingdom subsidiary (which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2018), for which the functional currency was the British pound.  For subsidiaries whose functional currency is deemed to be other than the United States dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated at year-end exchange rates and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year.  Translation adjustments are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Any gains or losses on transactions or monetary assets or liabilities in currencies other than the functional currency are included in net income in the current period.  See Notes 4 and 17.\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share.\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed based upon the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the assumed issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive securities.  See Note 9.\nStock-Based Compensation\n.  EOG measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award.  See Note 7.\nLeases.\nEffective January 1, 2019, EOG adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842)\" (ASU 2016-02).  ASU 2016-02 and other related ASUs require that lessees recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and related lease liability, representing the obligation to make lease payments for certain lease transactions, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and disclose additional leasing information.\nF-13\nEOG elected to adopt ASU 2016-02 and other related ASUs using the modified retrospective approach with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the effective date.  Financial results reported in periods prior to January 1, 2019, are unchanged.  Additionally, EOG elected the package of practical expedients within ASU 2016-02 that allows an entity to not reassess prior to the effective date (i) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (ii) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, or (iii) initial direct costs for any existing leases, but did not elect the practical expedient of hindsight when determining the lease term of existing contracts at the effective date.  EOG also elected the practical expedient under ASU 2018-01, \"Leases (Topic 842) - Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842,\" and did not evaluate existing or expired land easements not previously accounted for as leases prior to the January 1, 2019 effective date.  There was no impact to retained earnings upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 and other related ASUs.\nIn the ordinary course of business, EOG enters into contracts for drilling, fracturing, compression, real estate and other services which contain equipment and other assets and that meet the definition of a lease under ASU 2016-02.  The lease term for these contracts, which includes any renewals at EOG's option that are reasonably certain to be exercised, ranges from one month to 30 years.\nROU assets and related liabilities are recognized on the commencement date on the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on future lease payments, discounted based on the rate implicit in the contract, if readily determinable, or EOG's incremental borrowing rate commensurate with the lease term of the contract.  EOG estimates its incremental borrowing rate based on the approximate rate required to borrow on a collateralized basis.  Contracts with lease terms of less than 12 months are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, but instead are disclosed as short-term lease cost.  EOG has elected not to separate non-lease components from all leases, excluding those for fracturing services, real estate and salt water disposal, as lease payments under these contracts contain significant non-lease components, such as labor and operating costs. See Note 18.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, \"Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848)\" (ASU 2020-04), which provides optional expedients and exceptions for accounting treatment of contracts which are affected by the anticipated discontinuation of the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other rates resulting from rate reform. Contract terms that are modified due to the replacement of a reference rate are not required to be remeasured or reassessed under relevant accounting standards. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2020-04 covers certain contracts which reference these rates and that are entered into on or before December 31, 2022. EOG is evaluating the provisions of ASU 2020-04 and has not determined the full impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures related to its $\n2.0\nbillion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740) ‑ Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\" (ASU 2019-12), which amends certain aspects of accounting for income taxes.  ASU 2019-12 removes specific exceptions within existing U.S. GAAP related to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation and to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in interim periods, among other changes.  ASU 2019-12 also requires an entity to reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date, among other requirements.  ASU 2019-12 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, and early adoption is permitted.  EOG will adopt ASU 2019-12 effective January 1, 2021, with all of the anticipated and applicable effects to be required on a prospective basis.  EOG does not expect the adoption of ASU 2019-12 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nF-14\n2.\nLong-Term Debt\nLong-Term Debt at December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAt December 31, 2020, the aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt (excluding finance lease obligations) were $\n750\nmillion in 2021,\nzero\nin 2022, $\n1.25\nbillion in 2023,\nzero\nin 2024 and $\n500\nmillion in 2025.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, EOG had\nno\noutstanding commercial paper borrowings and did not utilize any commercial paper borrowings during 2020 and 2019.\nOn February 1, 2021, EOG repaid upon maturity the $\n750\nmillion aggregate principal amount of its\n4.100\n% Senior Notes due 2021.\nOn June 1, 2020, EOG repaid upon maturity the $\n500\nmillion aggregate principal amount of its\n4.40\n% Senior Notes due 2020.\nOn April 14, 2020, EOG closed on its offering of $\n750\nmillion aggregate principal amount of its\n4.375\n% Senior Notes due 2030 and $\n750\nmillion aggregate principal amount of its\n4.950\n% Senior Notes due 2050 (together, the Notes).  Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2020.  EOG received net proceeds of $\n1.48\nbillion from the issuance of the Notes, which were used to repay the 4.40% Senior Notes due 2020 when they matured on June 1, 2020 (see below), and for general corporate purposes, including the funding of capital expenditures.\nOn April 1, 2020, EOG repaid upon maturity the $\n500\nmillion aggregate principal amount of its\n2.45\n% Senior Notes due 2020.\nOn June 27, 2019, EOG entered into a new $\n2.0\nbillion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement (the Agreement) with domestic and foreign lenders (Banks).  The Agreement replaced EOG's $\n2.0\nbillion senior unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of July 21, 2015, with domestic and foreign lenders, which had a scheduled maturity date of\nJuly 21, 2020\nand which was terminated by EOG (without penalty), effective as of June 27, 2019, in connection with the execution of the Agreement.\nF-15\nThe Agreement has a scheduled maturity date of\nJune 27, 2024\n, and includes an option for EOG to extend, on up to two occasions, the term for successive one-year periods subject to certain terms and conditions.  The Agreement (i) commits the Banks to provide advances up to an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion at any one time outstanding, with an option for EOG to request increases in the aggregate commitments to an amount not to exceed $\n3.0\nbillion, subject to certain terms and conditions and (ii) includes a swingline subfacility and a letter of credit subfacility.  Advances under the Agreement will accrue interest based, at EOG's option, on either the LIBOR plus an applicable margin (Eurodollar rate) or the base rate (as defined in the Agreement) plus an applicable margin.  The Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants and events of default that EOG believes are customary for investment-grade, senior unsecured commercial bank credit agreements, including a financial covenant for the maintenance of a ratio of total debt-to-capitalization (as such terms are defined in the Agreement) of no greater than\n65\n%.  At December 31, 2020, EOG was in compliance with this financial covenant.  At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were\nno\nborrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the Agreement.  The Eurodollar rate and base rate (inclusive of the applicable margin), had there been any amounts borrowed under the Agreement at December 31, 2020, would have been\n1.04\n% and\n3.25\n%, respectively.\nOn June 3, 2019, EOG repaid upon maturity the $\n900\nmillion aggregate principal amount of its\n5.625\n% Senior Notes due 2019.\n3.\nStockholders' Equity\nCommon Stock.\nIn September 2001, EOG's Board of Directors (Board) authorized the purchase of an aggregate maximum of\n10\nmillion shares of Common Stock that superseded all previous authorizations.  At December 31, 2020,\n6,386,200\nshares remained available for purchase under this authorization.  EOG last purchased shares of its Common Stock under this authorization in March 2003.  In addition, shares of Common Stock are from time to time withheld by, or returned to, EOG in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations arising upon the exercise of employee stock options or stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs), the vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock unit or performance unit grants or in payment of the exercise price of employee stock options.  Such shares withheld or returned do not count against the Board authorization discussed above.  Shares purchased, withheld and returned are held in treasury for, among other purposes, fulfilling any obligations arising under EOG's stock-based compensation plans and any other approved transactions or activities for which such shares of Common Stock may be required.\nOn February 25, 2021, the Board increased the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock from the previous $\n0.375\nper share to $\n0.4125\nper share, effective beginning with the dividend to be paid on April 30, 2021, to stockholders of record as of April 16, 2021.\nOn February 27, 2020, the Board increased the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock from the previous $\n0.2875\nper share to $\n0.375\nper share, effective beginning with the dividend to be paid on April 30, 2020, to stockholders of record as of April 16, 2020.\nOn May 2, 2019, the Board increased the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock from the previous $\n0.22\nper share to $\n0.2875\nper share, effective beginning with the dividend paid on July 31, 2019, to stockholders of record as of July 17, 2019.\nOn August 2, 2018, the Board increased the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock from the previous $\n0.1850\nper share to $\n0.22\nper share, effective beginning with the dividend paid on October 31, 2018, to stockholders of record as of October 17, 2018.  On February 27, 2018, the Board increased the quarterly cash dividend on the common stock from the previous $\n0.1675\nper share to $\n0.1850\nper share, effective beginning with the dividend paid on April 30, 2018, to stockholders of record as of April 16, 2018.\nF-16\nThe following summarizes Common Stock activity for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 (in thousands):\n(1)\nRepresents shares that were withheld by or returned to EOG (i) in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations that arose upon the exercise of employee stock options or SARs or the vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock unit or performance unit grants or (ii) in payment of the exercise price of employee stock options.\nPreferred Stock\n.  EOG currently has one authorized series of preferred stock.  As of December 31, 2020, there were\nno\nshares of preferred stock outstanding.\nF-17\n4.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss includes certain transactions that have generally been reported in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity.\nThe components of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss at December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nNo\nsignificant amount was reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n5.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net for 2020 included interest income ($\n12\nmillion), partially offset by equity losses from investments in ammonia plants in Trinidad ($\n2\nmillion).   Other income, net for 2019 included interest income ($\n26\nmillion) and net foreign currency transaction gains ($\n2\nmillion).  Other income, net for 2018 included interest income ($\n12\nmillion), a downward adjustment to deferred compensation expense ($\n6\nmillion) and equity income from investments in ammonia plants in Trinidad ($\n2\nmillion), partially offset by net foreign currency transaction losses ($\n7\nmillion).\nF-18\n6.\nIncome Taxes\nThe principal components of EOG's total net deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in thousands):\nThe components of Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes for the years indicated below were as follows (in thousands):\nF-19\nThe principal components of EOG's Income Tax Provision (Benefit) for the years indicated below were as follows (in thousands):\n(1)\nIncludes changes in certain amounts that are expected to be paid or received beyond the next twelve months.  The primary component is refundable alternative minimum tax (AMT) credits.\nThe differences between taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate and EOG's effective rate for the years indicated below were as follows:\n(1)\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was enacted in 2017 and required certain measurement-period adjustments in 2018.\n(2)\nIncludes impact of utilizing certain tax net operating losses (NOLs) ((\n1.2\n)%), the reversal of the federal sequestration charge ((\n1.0\n)%) and other TCJA impacts ((\n0.4\n)%).\nThe net effective tax rate of 18% in 2020 was lower than the prior year rate of 23% primarily due to taxes attributable to EOG's foreign operations and increased stock-based compensation tax deficiencies.\nDeferred tax assets are recorded for certain tax benefits, including tax NOLs and tax credit carryforwards, provided that management assesses the utilization of such assets to be \"more likely than not.\"  Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets.  On the basis of this evaluation, EOG has recorded valuation allowances for the portion of certain foreign and state deferred tax assets that management does not believe are more likely than not to be realized.\nF-20\nThe principal components of EOG's rollforward of valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets for the years indicated below were as follows (in thousands):\n(1)\nIncrease in valuation allowance related to the generation of tax NOLs and other deferred tax assets.\n(2)\nDecrease in valuation allowance associated with adjustments to certain deferred tax assets and their related allowances.\n(3)\nRepresents dispositions, revisions and/or foreign exchange rate variances and the effect of statutory income tax rate changes.  The United Kingdom operations were sold in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2020, EOG had state income tax NOLs of approximately $\n1.9\nbillion, which, if unused, expire between 2021 and 2039.   EOG also has Canadian NOLs of $\n275\nmillion, some of which can be carried forward up to 20 years. As described above, these NOLs and other less significant tax benefits have been evaluated for the likelihood of utilization, and valuation allowances have been established for the portion of these deferred income tax assets that do not meet the “more likely than not” threshold.\nThe total balance of unrecognized tax benefits for all jurisdictions at December 31, 2020, was $\n10\nmillion, resulting from the tax treatment of certain compensation deductions, of which the full amount may potentially have an earnings impact.  During the fourth quarter of 2020, EOG settled uncertain tax positions resulting from its tax treatment of research and experiential expenditures related to certain innovations in its horizontal drilling and completion operations for taxable years 2016 and 2017.  Consequently, the balance of uncertain tax positions and earnings for the period decreased $\n29\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion, respectively.  EOG records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits to its income tax provision.\nNo\ninterest expense has been recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss) related to the remaining unrecognized tax benefits as these positions will be claimed on amended returns or as self-proposed audit adjustments, which, if sustained, will result in refunds.  EOG does not anticipate that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits will change materially during the next twelve months.  EOG and its subsidiaries file income tax returns and are subject to tax audits in the U.S. and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions.  EOG's earliest open tax years in its principal jurisdictions are as follows: U.S. federal (2016), Canada (2016), Trinidad (2013) and China (2010).\nEOG's foreign subsidiaries' undistributed earnings are not considered to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S.  Accordingly, EOG may be required to accrue certain U.S. federal, state, and foreign deferred income taxes on these undistributed earnings as well as on any other outside basis differences related to its investments in these subsidiaries.  As of December 31, 2020, EOG has cumulatively recorded $\n10\nmillion of deferred foreign income taxes for withholdings on its undistributed foreign earnings.  Additionally, EOG's foreign earnings may be subject to the U.S. federal \"global intangible low-taxed income\" (GILTI) inclusion.  EOG records any GILTI tax as a period expense.\n7.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nStock-Based Compensation\nDuring 2020, EOG maintained various stock-based compensation plans as discussed below.  EOG recognizes compensation expense on grants of stock options, SARs, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance units and grants made under the EOG Resources, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).  Stock-based compensation expense is calculated based upon the grant date estimated fair value of the awards, net of forfeitures, based upon EOG's historical employee turnover rate.  Compensation expense is amortized over the shorter of the vesting period or the period from date of grant until the date the employee becomes eligible to retire without company approval.\nF-21\nStock-based compensation expense is included on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss) based upon the job functions of the employees receiving the grants.  Compensation expense related to EOG's stock-based compensation plans for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was as follows (in millions):\nThe Amended and Restated EOG Resources, Inc. 2008 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (2008 Plan) provides for grants of stock options, SARs, restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance units, and other stock-based awards.\nThe vesting schedules for grants of stock options, SARs, restricted stock and restricted stock units, and performance units are generally as follows:\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately\n2.0\nmillion common shares remained available for grant under the 2008 Plan.  EOG's policy is to issue shares related to the 2008 Plan from previously authorized unissued shares or treasury shares to the extent treasury shares are available.\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, EOG issued shares in connection with stock option/SAR exercises, restricted stock grants, restricted stock unit and performance unit releases and ESPP purchases.  Net tax deficiencies and excess tax benefits recognized within the income tax provision were $(\n22\n) million, $(\n1\n) million and $\n20\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nStock Options and Stock-Settled Stock Appreciation Rights and Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nParticipants in EOG's stock-based compensation plans (including the 2008 Plan) have been or may be granted options to purchase shares of Common Stock.  In addition, participants in EOG's stock plans (including the 2008 Plan) have been or may be granted SARs, representing the right to receive shares of Common Stock based on the appreciation in the stock price from the date of grant on the number of SARs granted.  Stock options and SARs are granted at a price not less than the market price of the Common Stock on the date of grant.  Terms for stock options and SARs granted have generally not exceeded a maximum term of\nseven years\n.  EOG's ESPP allows eligible employees to semi-annually purchase, through payroll deductions, shares of Common Stock at\n85\npercent of the fair market value at specified dates.  Contributions to the ESPP are limited to\n10\npercent of the employee's pay (subject to certain ESPP limits) during each of the two six-month offering periods each year.\nF-22\nThe fair value of stock option grants and SAR grants is estimated using the Hull-White II binomial option pricing model.  The fair value of ESPP grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton model.  Stock-based compensation expense related to stock option, SAR and ESPP grants totaled $\n62\nmillion, $\n63\nmillion and $\n60\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWeighted average fair values and valuation assumptions used to value stock option, SAR and ESPP grants for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nExpected volatility is based on an equal weighting of historical volatility and implied volatility from traded options in EOG's Common Stock.  The risk-free interest rate is based upon United States Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant.  The expected life is based upon historical experience and contractual terms of stock option, SAR and ESPP grants.\nThe following table sets forth the stock option and SAR transactions for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (stock options and SARs in thousands):\n(1)\nThe total intrinsic value of stock options/SARs exercised during the years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n0.4\nmillion, $\n14\nmillion and $\n118\nmillion, respectively.  The intrinsic value is based upon the difference between the market price of the Common Stock on the date of exercise and the grant price of the stock options/SARs.\nAt December 31, 2020, there were\n9.9\nmillion stock options/SARs vested or expected to vest with a weighted average grant price of $\n84.76\nper share, an intrinsic value of $\n22.5\nmillion and a weighted average remaining contractual life of\n4.2\nyears.\nF-23\nThe following table summarizes certain information for the stock options and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2020 (stock options and SARs in thousands):\n(1)\nBased upon the difference between the closing market price of the Common Stock on the last trading day of the year and the grant price of in-the-money stock options and SARs, in thousands.\nAt December 31, 2020, unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock option and SAR grants totaled $\n53\nmillion.  This unrecognized expense will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of\n2.1\nyears.\nAt the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, EOG stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of the ESPP to (among other changes) increase the number of shares available for grant.  At December 31, 2020, approximately\n1.9\nmillion shares of Common Stock remained available for grant under the ESPP.\nThe following table summarizes ESPP activity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except number of participants):\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.\nEmployees may be granted restricted (non-vested) stock and/or restricted stock units without cost to them.  Upon vesting of restricted stock, shares of Common Stock are released to the employee.  Upon vesting, restricted stock units are converted into shares of Common Stock and released to the employee.  Stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and restricted stock units totaled $\n75\nmillion, $\n97\nmillion and $\n81\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nF-24\nThe following table sets forth the restricted stock and restricted stock unit transactions for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (shares and units in thousands):\n(1)\nThe total intrinsic value of restricted stock and restricted stock units released during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n48\nmillion, $\n70\nmillion and $\n84\nmillion, respectively.  The intrinsic value is based upon the closing price of EOG's common stock on the date restricted stock and restricted stock units are released.\n(2)\nThe total intrinsic value of restricted stock and restricted stock units outstanding at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n236\nmillion, $\n381\nmillion and $\n331\nmillion, respectively.  The intrinsic value is based on the closing market price of the Common Stock on the last trading day of the year.\nAt December 31, 2020, unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock and restricted stock units totaled $\n178\nmillion.  Such unrecognized expense will be recognized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of\n1.6\nyears.\nPerformance Units.\nEOG has granted performance units (Performance Awards) to its executive officers annually since 2012.  As more fully discussed in the grant agreements, the performance metric applicable to these performance-based grants is EOG's total shareholder return over a\nthree\n-year performance period relative to the total shareholder return of a designated group of peer companies (Performance Period).  Upon the application of the performance multiple at the completion of the Performance Period, a minimum of\n0\n% and a maximum of\n200\n% of the Performance Awards granted could be outstanding.  The fair value of the Performance Awards is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation.  Stock-based compensation expense related to the Performance Award grants totaled $\n9\nmillion, $\n15\nmillion and $\n14\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWeighted average fair values and valuation assumptions used to value Performance Awards during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nExpected volatility is based on the term-matched historical volatility over the simulated term, which is calculated as the time between the grant date and the end of the Performance Period.  The risk-free interest rate is derived from the Treasury Constant Maturities yield curve on the grant date.\nF-25\nThe following table sets forth the Performance Award transactions for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (units in thousands):\n(1)\nUpon completion of the Performance Period for the Performance Awards granted in 2016, 2015 and 2014, a performance multiple of\n150\n%,\n200\n% and\n200\n%, respectively, was applied to each of the grants resulting in additional grants of Performance Awards in February 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n(2)\nThe total intrinsic value of Performance Awards released during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n13\nmillion, $\n15\nmillion and $\n18\nmillion, respectively.  The intrinsic value is based upon the closing price of EOG's common stock on the date Performance Awards are released.\n(3)\nThe total intrinsic value of Performance Awards outstanding at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n31\nmillion, $\n50\nmillion and $\n47\nmillion, respectively.  The intrinsic value is based on the closing market price of the Common Stock on the last trading day of the year.\n(4)\nUpon the application of the relevant performance multiple at the completion of each of the remaining Performance Periods, a minimum of\n77\nand a maximum of\n1,149\nPerformance Awards could be outstanding.\nAt December 31, 2020, unrecognized compensation expense related to Performance Awards totaled $\n5\nmillion.  Such unrecognized expense will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of\n1.9\nyears.\nUpon completion of the Performance Period for the Performance Awards granted in September 2017, a performance multiple of\n125\n% was applied to the grants resulting in an additional grant of\n19,629\nPerformance Awards in February 2021.\nPension Plans.\nEOG has a defined contribution pension plan in place for most of its employees in the United States.  EOG's contributions to the pension plan are based on various percentages of compensation and, in some instances, are based upon the amount of the employees' contributions.  EOG's total costs recognized for the plan were $\n46\nmillion, $\n51\nmillion and $\n43\nmillion for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIn addition, EOG's Trinidadian subsidiary maintains a contributory defined benefit pension plan and a matched savings plan.  These pension plans are available to most employees of the Trinidadian subsidiary.  EOG's combined contributions to these plans were $\n1\nmillion, for each of 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFor the Trinidadian defined benefit pension plan, the benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets and accrued benefit cost totaled $\n13\nmillion, $\n12\nmillion and $\n0.1\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2020, and $\n12\nmillion, $\n10\nmillion and $\n0.1\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2019.\nPostretirement Health Care.\nEOG has postretirement medical and dental benefits in place for eligible United States and Trinidad employees and their eligible dependents, the costs of which are not material.\nF-26\n8.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nLetters of Credit and Guarantees.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, EOG had standby letters of credit and guarantees outstanding totaling $\n854\nmillion and $\n902\nmillion, primarily representing guarantees of payment or performance obligations on behalf of subsidiaries.

The Segment Reporting Topic of the ASC establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements.  Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.  EOG's chief operating decision-making process is informal and involves the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and other key officers.  This group routinely reviews and makes operating decisions related to significant issues associated with each of EOG's major producing areas in the United States, Trinidad and China and its exploration program in the Sultanate of Oman (Oman).  For segment reporting purposes, the chief operating decision makers consider the major United States producing areas to be one operating segment.\nF-28\nFinancial information by reportable segment is presented below as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nF-29\n(1)\nOther International primarily consists of EOG's United Kingdom, China and Canada operations.  EOG began an exploration program in Oman in the third quarter of 2020.  The United Kingdom operations were sold in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n(2)\nEOG had sales activity with three significant purchasers in 2020, each totaling $\n1.1\nbillion of consolidated Operating Revenues and Other in the United States segment.\n(3)\nEOG recorded pretax impairment charges of $\n1,570\nmillion in 2020 for proved oil and gas properties, leasehold costs and other assets due to the decline in commodity prices and revisions of asset retirement obligations for certain properties in the United States segment.  In addition, EOG recorded pretax impairment charges of $\n228\nmillion in 2020 for owned and leased sand and crude-by-rail assets, also in the United States segment.  EOG recorded pretax impairment charges of $81 million in 2020 for proved oil and gas properties and firm commitment contracts related to its decision to exit the Horn River Basin in British Columbia, Canada, in the Other International segment.  See Notes 13 and 14.\n(4)\nEOG had sales activity with two significant purchasers in 2019, one totaling $\n2.4\nbillion and the other totaling $\n2.2\nbillion of consolidated Operating Revenues and Other in the United States segment.\n(5)\nEOG had sales activity with two significant purchasers in 2018, one totaling $\n2.6\nbillion and the other totaling $\n2.3\nbillion of consolidated Operating Revenues and Other in the United States segment.\nF-30\n12.\nRisk Management Activities\nCommodity\nPrice Risks.\nEOG engages in price risk management activities from time to time.  These activities are intended to manage EOG's exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas.  EOG utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments, primarily price swap, option, swaption, collar and basis swap contracts, as a means to manage this price risk.\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, EOG elected not to designate any of its financial commodity derivative contracts as accounting hedges and, accordingly, accounted for these financial commodity derivative contracts using the mark-to-market accounting method.  Under this accounting method, changes in the fair value of outstanding financial instruments are recognized as gains or losses in the period of change and are recorded as Gains (Losses) on Mark-to-Market Commodity Derivative Contracts on the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  The related cash flow impact is reflected in Cash Flows from Operating Activities.  During 2020, 2019 and 2018, EOG recognized net gains (losses) on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts  of $\n1,145\nmillion, $\n180\nmillion and $(\n166\n) million, respectively, which included cash received from (payments for) settlements of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas derivative contracts of $\n1,071\nmillion, $\n231\nmillion and $(\n259\n) million, respectively.\nCrude Oil Derivative Contracts.\nPrices received by EOG for its crude oil production generally vary from U.S. New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices due to adjustments for delivery location (basis) and other factors.\nEOG has entered into crude oil basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) Brent pricing and pricing in Cushing, Oklahoma (ICE Brent Differential). Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's ICE Brent Differential basis swap contracts as of December 31, 2020. The weighted average price differential expressed in dollars per barrel ($/Bbl) represents the amount of addition to Cushing, Oklahoma, prices for the notional volumes expressed in barrels per day (Bbld) covered by the basis swap contracts.\nEOG has also entered into crude oil basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between pricing in Houston, Texas, and Cushing, Oklahoma (Houston Differential).

These contracts offset the remaining Mont Belvieu propane price swap contracts for the same time period with notional volumes of\n25,000\nBbld at a weighted average price of $\n17.92\nper Bbl. EOG received net cash of $\n8.0\nmillion through December 31, 2020, for the settlement of certain of these contracts, and expects to receive net cash of $\n1.2\nmillion during January 2021 for the settlement of the remaining contracts. The offsetting contracts were excluded from the above table.\nNatural Gas Derivative Contracts.\nPresented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's natural gas NYMEX Henry Hub price swap contracts as of December 31, 2020, with notional volumes sold (purchased) expressed in million British thermal units (MMBtu) per day (MMBtud) and prices expressed in dollars per MMBtu ($/MMBtu).\nIn December 2020, EOG entered into natural gas NYMEX Henry Hub price swap contracts for the period from January 1, 2021 through March 31, 2021, with notional volumes of\n500,000\nMMBtud at a weighted average price of $\n2.43\nper MMBtu.  These contracts offset the remaining natural gas NYMEX Henry Hub price swap contracts for the same time period with notional volumes of\n500,000\nMMBtud at a weighted average price of $\n2.99\nper MMBtu.  EOG expects to receive net cash of $\n25.2\nmillion during 2021 for the settlement of these contracts.  The offsetting contracts were excluded from the above table.\nF-33\nEOG has entered into natural gas collar contracts, which establish ceiling and floor prices for the sale of notional volumes of natural gas as specified in the collar contracts. The collars require that EOG pay the difference between the ceiling price and the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price for the contract month (Henry Hub Index Price) in the event the Henry Hub Index Price is above the ceiling price. The collars grant EOG the right to receive the difference between the floor price and the Henry Hub Index Price in the event the Henry Hub Index Price is below the floor price. In March 2020, EOG executed the early termination provision granting EOG the right to terminate certain 2020 natural gas collar contracts with notional volumes of 250,000 MMBtud at a weighted average ceiling price of $2.50 per MMBtu and a weighted average floor price of $2.00 per MMBtu for the period from April 1, 2020 through July 31, 2020.

In March 2020, EOG executed the early termination provision granting EOG the right to terminate certain 2020 HSC Differential basis swaps with notional volumes of\n60,000\nMMBtud at a weighted average price differential of $\n0.05\nper MMBtu for the period from April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020.  EOG paid net cash of $\n0.4\nmillion for the settlement of these contracts.  Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's HSC Differential basis swap contracts as of December 31, 2020.  The weighted average price differential expressed in $/MMBtu represents the amount of reduction to NYMEX Henry Hub prices for the notional volumes expressed in MMBtud covered by the basis swap contracts.\nF-34\nEOG has also entered into natural gas basis swap contracts in order to fix the differential between pricing at the Waha Hub in West Texas and NYMEX Henry Hub prices (Waha Differential).  Presented below is a comprehensive summary of EOG's Waha Differential basis swap contracts as of December 31, 2020.  The weighted average price differential expressed in $/MMBtu represents the amount of reduction to NYMEX Henry Hub prices for the notional volumes expressed in MMBtud covered by the basis swap contracts.\nIn April 2020, EOG entered into Waha Differential basis swap contracts for the period from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, with notional volumes of\n50,000\nMMBtud at a weighted average price differential of $\n0.43\nper MMBtu. These contracts offset the remaining Waha Differential basis swap contracts for the same time period with notional volumes of\n50,000\nMMBtud at a weighted average price differential of $\n1.40\nper MMBtu. EOG paid net cash of $\n11.9\nmillion for the settlement of these contracts. The offsetting contracts were excluded from the above table.\nCommodity Derivatives Location on Balance Sheet.\nThe following table sets forth the amounts and classification of EOG's outstanding derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Certain amounts may be presented on a net basis on the consolidated financial statements when such amounts are with the same counterparty and subject to a master netting arrangement (in thousands):\n(1)\nThe current portion of Assets from Price Risk Management Activities consists of gross assets of $\n3\nmillion, partially offset by gross liabilities of $\n2\nmillion, at December 31, 2019.\n(2)\nThe current portion of Liabilities from Price Risk Management Activities consists of gross liabilities of $\n23\nmillion, partially offset by gross assets of $\n3\nmillion at December 31, 2019.\nF-35\nCredit Risk.\nNotional contract amounts are used to express the magnitude of a financial derivative.  The amounts potentially subject to credit risk, in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties, are equal to the fair value of such contracts (see Note 13).  EOG evaluates its exposure to significant counterparties on an ongoing basis, including those arising from physical and financial transactions.  In some instances, EOG renegotiates payment terms and/or requires collateral, parent guarantees or letters of credit to minimize credit risk.\nAt December 31, 2020, EOG's net accounts receivable balance related to United States hydrocarbon sales included two receivable balances, each of which accounted for more than\n10\n% of the total balance.  The receivables were due from two petroleum refinery companies.  The related amounts were collected during early 2021.  At December 31, 2019, EOG's net accounts receivable balance related to United States hydrocarbon sales included three receivable balances, each of which accounted for more than\n10\n% of the total balance.  The receivables were due from three petroleum refinery companies.  The related amounts were collected during early 2020.\nIn 2020 and 2019, all natural gas from EOG's Trinidad operations was sold to the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited and its subsidiary.  In 2020 and 2019, all crude oil and condensate from EOG's Trinidad operations was sold to Heritage Petroleum Company Limited.  In 2020 and 2019, all natural gas from EOG's China operations was sold to Petrochina Company Limited.\nAll of EOG's derivative instruments are covered by International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreements (ISDAs) with counterparties.  The ISDAs may contain provisions that require EOG, if it is the party in a net liability position, to post collateral when the amount of the net liability exceeds the threshold level specified for EOG's then-current credit ratings.  In addition, the ISDAs may also provide that as a result of certain circumstances, including certain events that cause EOG's credit ratings to become materially weaker than its then-current ratings, the counterparty may require all outstanding derivatives under the ISDA to be settled immediately.  See Note 13 for the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments that were in a net asset position at December 31, 2020 and a net liability position at December 31, 2019.  EOG had\nno\ncollateral posted and held\nno\ncollateral at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nSubstantially all of EOG's accounts receivable at December 31, 2020 and 2019 resulted from hydrocarbon sales and/or joint interest billings to third-party companies, including foreign state-owned entities in the oil and gas industry.  This concentration of customers and joint interest owners may impact EOG's overall credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.  In determining whether or not to require collateral or other credit enhancements from a customer, EOG typically analyzes the entity's net worth, cash flows, earnings and credit ratings.  Receivables are generally not collateralized.  During the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, credit losses incurred on receivables by EOG have been immaterial.\n13.\nFair Value Measurements\nCertain of EOG's financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are reported at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  An established fair value hierarchy prioritizes the relative reliability of inputs used in fair value measurements.  The hierarchy gives highest priority to Level 1 inputs that represent unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.  Level 2 inputs are directly or indirectly observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs and have the lowest priority in the hierarchy.  EOG gives consideration to the credit risk of its counterparties, as well as its own credit risk, when measuring financial assets and liabilities at fair value.\nF-36\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements.\nThe following table provides fair value measurement information within the fair value hierarchy for certain of EOG's financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2020 and 2019.  Amounts shown in thousands.\n(1)    $\n65\nmillion and $\n1\nmillion are included in \"Current Assets - Assets from Price Risk Management Activities\" at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  $\n1\nmillion is included in \"Other Assets\" at December 31, 2020, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2)    $\n1\nmillion is included in \"Other Liabilities\" at December 31, 2020, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  $\n20\nmillion is included in \"Current Liabilities - Liabilities from Price Risk Management Activities\" at December 31, 2019 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe estimated fair value of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas derivative contracts (including options/collars) was based upon forward commodity price curves based on quoted market prices.  Commodity derivative contracts were valued by utilizing an independent third-party derivative valuation provider who uses various types of valuation models, as applicable.\nNon-Recurring Fair Value Measurements.\nThe initial measurement of asset retirement obligations at fair value is calculated using discounted cash flow techniques and based on internal estimates of future retirement costs associated with property, plant and equipment.  Significant Level 3 inputs used in the calculation of asset retirement obligations include plugging costs and reserve lives.  A reconciliation of EOG's asset retirement obligations is presented in Note 15.\nWhen circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, EOG compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset.  If the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on EOG's estimate of (and assumptions regarding) significant Level 3 inputs, including future crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices, operating costs, development expenditures, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value.  Fair value is generally calculated using the Income Approach described in the Fair Value Measurement Topic of the ASC.  In certain instances, EOG utilizes accepted offers from third-party purchasers as the basis for determining fair value.\nDuring 2020, due to the decline in commodity prices and revisions of asset retirement obligations for certain properties, proved oil and gas properties with a carrying amount of $\n1,587\nmillion were written down to their fair value of $\n319\nmillion, resulting in pretax impairment charges of $\n1,268\nmillion.  In addition, EOG recorded pretax impairment charges in 2020 of $\n72\nmillion for a commodity price-related write-down of other assets.\nDuring 2019, proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets with a carrying amount of $\n998\nmillion were written down to their fair value of $\n701\nmillion, resulting in pretax impairment charges of $\n297\nmillion.  Included in the $\n297\nmillion pretax impairment charges are $\n152\nmillion of impairments of proved oil and gas properties for which EOG utilized an accepted offer from a third-party purchaser as the basis for determining fair value.  In addition, EOG recorded pretax impairment charges in 2019 of $\n90\nmillion for a commodity price-related write-down of other assets.\nF-37\nEOG utilized average prices per acre from comparable market transactions and estimated discounted cash flows as the basis for determining the fair value of unproved and proved properties, respectively, received in non-cash property exchanges.  See Note 10.\nFair Value of Debt.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, EOG had outstanding $\n5,640\nmillion and $\n5,140\nmillion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, which had estimated fair values of approximately $\n6,505\nmillion and $\n5,452\nmillion, respectively.  The estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and, where such prices were not available, other observable (Level 2) inputs regarding interest rates available to EOG at year-end.\n14.\nImpairment Expense\nImpairment expense was as follows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\n(1)\nImpairments to proved oil and gas properties in 2020 included legacy and non-core natural gas and crude oil and combo plays.  Impairments to proved oil and gas properties in 2019 and 2018 included domestic legacy natural gas assets.  See Notes 1 and 13.\n(2)\nUnproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term.

Additionally, EOG received proceeds in 2018 of approximately $\n227\nmillion, primarily due to the sale of its United Kingdom operations in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n18.\nLeases\nLease costs are classified by the function of the ROU asset.  The lease costs related to exploration and development activities are initially included in the Oil and Gas Properties line on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently accounted for in accordance with the Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas Topic of the ASC.  Variable lease cost represents costs incurred above the contractual minimum payments and other charges associated with leased equipment, primarily for drilling and fracturing contracts classified as operating leases.\nThe components of lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nOperating lease cost includes impairment expenses of $35 million in 2020.\nF-40\nThe following table sets forth the amounts and classification of EOG's outstanding ROU assets and related lease liabilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019 and supplemental information for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions, except lease terms and discount rates):\n(1)\nFinance lease assets are recorded net of accumulated amortization of $\n81\nmillion and $\n60\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCash paid for leases for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows (in millions):\nNon-cash leasing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, included the additions of $\n893\nmillion of operating leases and $\n174\nmillion of finance leases.  Non-cash leasing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, included the addition of $\n784\nmillion of operating leases.  Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019, EOG recognized operating lease ROU of $\n566\nmillion.\nF-41\nAt December 31, 2020, the future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable leases were as follows (in millions):\nAt December 31, 2020, EOG had additional leases of $\n100\nmillion, which are expected to commence in 2021 with lease terms of\ntwo\nto\nnine years\n.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2016-02 and other related ASUs, the future minimum commitments under non-cancellable leases, including non-lease components and excluding contracts with lease terms of less than 12 months as December 31, 2018, were as follows (in millions):\nF-42\nEOG RESOURCES, INC.\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In Thousands, Except Per Share Data, Unless Otherwise Indicated)\n(Unaudited)\nOil and Gas Producing Activities\nThe following disclosures are made in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update No. 2010-03 \"Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures\" and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) final rule on \"Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting.\"\nOil and Gas Reserves.\nUsers of this information should be aware that the process of estimating quantities of \"proved,\" \"proved developed\" and \"proved undeveloped\" crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.  The data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, additional development activity; evolving production history; crude oil and condensate, NGL and natural gas prices; and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.  Consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time.  Although reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible, the significance of the subjective decisions required and variances in available data for various reservoirs make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates presented in connection with financial statement disclosures.  For related discussion, see ITEM 1A, Risk Factors.\nProved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated, with reasonable certainty, to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs under then-existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.\nProved developed reserves are proved reserves expected to be recovered under operating methods being utilized at the time the estimates were made, through wells and equipment in place or if the cost of any required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well.\nProved undeveloped reserves (PUDs) are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for completion or recompletion.  Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. PUDs can be recorded in respect of a particular undrilled location only if the location is scheduled, under the then-current drilling and development plan, to be drilled within five years from the date that the PUDs were recorded, unless specific factors (such as those described in interpretative guidance issued by the Staff of the SEC) justify a longer timeframe.  Likewise, absent any such specific factors, PUDs associated with a particular undeveloped drilling location shall be removed from the estimates of proved reserves if the location is scheduled, under the then-current drilling and development plan, to be drilled on a date that is beyond five years from the date that the PUDs were recorded.  EOG has formulated development plans for all drilling locations associated with its PUDs at December 31, 2020.  Under these plans, each PUD location will be drilled within five years from the date it was recorded.  Estimates for PUDs are not attributed to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.\nIn making estimates of PUDs, EOG's technical staff, including engineers and geoscientists, perform detailed technical analysis of each potential drilling location within its inventory of prospects.  In making a determination as to which of these locations would penetrate undrilled portions of the formation that can be judged, with reasonable certainty, to be continuous and contain economically producible crude oil, NGLs and natural gas, studies are conducted using numerous data elements and analysis techniques.  EOG's technical staff estimates the hydrocarbons in place, by mapping the entirety of the play in question using seismic techniques, typically employing two-dimensional and three-dimensional data.  This analysis is integrated with other static data, including, but not limited to, core analysis, mechanical properties of the formation, thermal maturity indicators, and well logs of existing penetrations.  Highly specialized equipment is utilized to prepare rock samples in assessing microstructures which contribute to porosity and permeability.\nAnalysis of dynamic data is then incorporated to arrive at the estimated fractional recovery of hydrocarbons in place.  Data analysis techniques employed include, but are not limited to, well testing analysis, static bottom hole pressure analysis, flowing bottom hole pressure analysis, analysis of historical production trends, pressure transient analysis and rate transient analysis.  Application of proprietary rate transient analysis techniques in low permeability rocks allow for quantification of estimates of contribution to production from both fractures and rock matrix.\nF-43\nEOG RESOURCES, INC.\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe impact of optimal completion techniques is a key factor in determining if the PUDs reflected in prospective locations are reasonably certain of being economically producible.  EOG's technical staff estimates the recovery improvement that might be achieved when completing horizontal wells with multi-stage fracture stimulation.  In the early stages of development of a play, EOG determines the optimal length of the horizontal lateral and multi-stage fracture stimulation using the aforementioned analysis techniques along with pilot drilling programs and gathering of microseismic data.\nThe process of analyzing static and dynamic data, well completion optimization data and the results of early development activities provides the appropriate level of certainty as well as support for the economic producibility of the plays in which PUDs are reflected.  EOG has found this approach to be effective based on successful application in analogous reservoirs in low permeability resource plays.\nCertain of EOG's Trinidad reserves are held under production sharing contracts where EOG's interest varies with prices and production volumes.  Trinidad reserves, as presented on a net basis, assume prices in existence at the time the estimates were made and EOG's estimate of future production volumes.  Future fluctuations in prices, production rates or changes in political or regulatory environments could cause EOG's share of future production from Trinidadian reserves to be materially different from that presented.\nEstimates of proved reserves at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were based on studies performed by the engineering staff of EOG.  The Engineering and Acquisitions Department is directly responsible for EOG's reserve evaluation process and consists of 17 professionals, all of whom hold, at a minimum, bachelor's degrees in engineering, and four of whom are Registered Professional Engineers.  The Vice President, Engineering and Acquisitions is the manager of this department and is the primary technical person responsible for this process.  The Vice President, Engineering and Acquisitions holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering, has 34 years of experience in reserve evaluations and is a Registered Professional Engineer.\nEOG's reserves estimation process is a collaborative effort coordinated by the Engineering and Acquisitions Department in compliance with EOG's internal controls for such process.  Reserve information as well as models used to estimate such reserves are stored on secured databases.  Non-technical inputs used in reserve estimation models, including crude oil, NGL and natural gas prices, production costs, transportation costs, future capital expenditures and EOG's net ownership percentages, are obtained from other departments within EOG.  EOG's Internal Audit Department conducts testing with respect to such non-technical inputs.  Additionally, EOG engages DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M), independent petroleum consultants, to perform independent reserves evaluation of select EOG properties comprising not less than 75% of EOG's estimates of proved reserves.  EOG's Board of Directors requires that D&M's and EOG's reserve quantities for the properties evaluated by D&M vary by no more than 5% in the aggregate.  Once completed, EOG's year-end reserves are presented to senior management, including the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; the Chief Operating Officer; the President; the Executive Vice President, Exploration and Production; and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for approval.\nOpinions by D&M for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 covered producing areas containing 83%, 82% and 79%, respectively, of proved reserves of EOG on a net-equivalent-barrel-of-oil basis.  D&M's opinions indicate that the estimates of proved reserves prepared by EOG's Engineering and Acquisitions Department for the properties reviewed by D&M, when compared in total on a net-equivalent-barrel-of-oil basis, do not differ materially from the estimates prepared by D&M.  Specifically, such estimates by D&M in the aggregate varied by not more than 5% from those prepared by the Engineering and Acquisitions Department of EOG.  All reports by D&M were developed utilizing geological and engineering data provided by EOG.  The report of D&M dated January 26, 2021, which contains further discussion of the reserve estimates and evaluations prepared by D&M, as well as the qualifications of D&M's technical person primarily responsible for overseeing such estimates and evaluations, is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated herein by reference.\nNo major discovery or other favorable or adverse event subsequent to December 31, 2020, is believed to have caused a material change in the estimates of net proved reserves as of that date.\nThe following tables set forth EOG's net proved reserves at December 31 for each of the four years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the changes in the net proved reserves for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, as estimated by the Engineering and Acquisitions Department of EOG:\nF-44\nEOG RESOURCES,

Revisions of previous estimates of negative 367 MMBoe for 2020 included a downward revision of 278 MMBoe primarily due to decreases in the average crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices used in the December 31, 2020, reserves estimation as compared to the prices used in the prior year estimate.  The primary areas affected were the Eagle Ford and the Rocky Mountain area.  Purchases in place of 10 MMBoe were primarily related to the Permian Basin and the purchase or exchange of other producing assets.\nDuring 2019, EOG added 750 MMBoe of proved reserves from drilling activities and technical evaluation of major proved areas, primarily in the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford and the Rocky Mountain area.  Approximately 72% of the 2019 reserve additions were crude oil and condensate and NGLs, and substantially all were in the United States.  Sales in place of 5 MMBoe were primarily related to the sale of certain South Texas area operations and the sale or exchange of other producing assets.  Revisions of previous estimates of negative 60 MMBoe for 2019 included a decrease in the average crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices used in the December 31, 2019, reserves estimation as compared to the prices used in the prior year estimate.  The primary area affected was the Rocky Mountain area.  Purchases in place of 17 MMBoe were primarily related to the South Texas area.\nDuring 2018, EOG added 670 MMBoe of proved reserves from drilling activities and technical evaluation of major proved areas, primarily in the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford, the Rocky Mountain area and the Mid-Continent area.  Approximately 76% of the 2018 reserve additions were crude oil and condensate and NGLs, and substantially all were in the United States.  Sales in place of 11 MMBoe were primarily related to the sale of the United Kingdom operations and the sale or exchange of other producing assets.  Revisions of previous estimates of negative 5 MMBoe for 2018 included an upward revision of 35 MMBoe primarily due to increases in the average crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices used in the December 31, 2018, reserves estimation as compared to the prices used in the prior year estimate.  The primary areas affected were in the Rocky Mountain area, the Eagle Ford and the Permian Basin.  Downward revisions other than price of 40 MMBoe resulted primarily from changes in production forecasts and higher production costs.  Purchases in place of 12 MMBoe were primarily related to the South Texas area.\nF-47\nEOG RESOURCES, INC.\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(1)\nOther International includes EOG's United Kingdom, China and Canada operations.

Revisions of previous estimates of negative 277 MMBoe of PUDs for 2020 included a downward price revision of 77 MMBoe due to decreases in the average crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices used in the December 31, 2020, reserves estimation as compared to the prices used in the prior year estimate.  Revisions other than price of negative 200 MMBoe were primarily related to the removal of PUD locations due to lower projected capital spending over the next five years as compared to the prior year projections.  The primary areas affected were the Eagle Ford and the Rocky Mountain area.  All PUDs, including drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs), are scheduled for completion within five years of the original reserve booking.\nFor the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019, total PUDs increased by 228 MMBoe to 1,608 MMBoe.  EOG added approximately 38 MMBoe of PUDs through drilling activities where the wells were drilled but significant expenditures remained for completion.  Based on the technology employed by EOG to identify and record PUDs, EOG added 540 MMBoe.  The PUD additions were primarily in the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford and, to a lesser extent, the Rocky Mountain area, and 73% of the additions were crude oil and condensate and NGLs.  During 2019, EOG drilled and transferred 302 MMBoe of PUDs to proved developed reserves at a total capital cost of $3,032 million.\nFor the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018, total PUDs increased by 217 MMBoe to 1,380 MMBoe.  EOG added approximately 31 MMBoe of PUDs through drilling activities where the wells were drilled but significant expenditures remained for completion.  Based on the technology employed by EOG to identify and record PUDs, EOG added 460 MMBoe.  The PUD additions were primarily in the Permian Basin, Anadarko Basin, the Eagle Ford and, to a lesser extent, the Rocky Mountain area, and 80% of the additions were crude oil and condensate and NGLs.  During 2018, EOG drilled and transferred 266 MMBoe of PUDs to proved developed reserves at a total capital cost of $2,745 million.\nF-49\nEOG RESOURCES, INC.\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nCapitalized Costs Relating to Oil and Gas Producing Activities.\nThe following table sets forth the capitalized costs relating to EOG's crude oil, NGLs and natural gas producing activities at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nCosts Incurred in Oil and Gas Property Acquisition, Exploration and Development Activities.\nThe acquisition, exploration and development costs disclosed in the following tables are in accordance with definitions in the Extractive Industries - Oil and Gas Topic of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).\nAcquisition costs include costs incurred to purchase, lease or otherwise acquire property.\nExploration costs include additions to exploratory wells, including those in progress, and exploration expenses.\nDevelopment costs include additions to production facilities and equipment and additions to development wells, including those in progress.\nF-50\nEOG RESOURCES, INC.\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe following table sets forth costs incurred related to EOG's oil and gas activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n(1)\nOther International primarily consists of EOG's United Kingdom, China and Canada operations.
