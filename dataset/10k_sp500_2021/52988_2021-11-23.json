Our BeyondExcellence Awards celebrate those who raise the bar and deliver the extraordinary with excellence.\nWe live inclusion\nAt Jacobs, we understand that inclusion means going beyond statements, commitments and initiatives to take tangible action that drives meaningful, measurable change both in our company and in the communities that we serve. It means\nPage 7\ncreating a workplace where our differences are not just accepted but are celebrated and harnessed to bring the innovative, extraordinary solutions to life that our clients demand from us. It means creating a culture of belonging where everyone can thrive — a culture that we call TogetherBeyond℠.\nOur eight Jacobs Employee Networks (JENs) promote inclusion and equality, not only within Jacobs but with our clients, potential recruits and within the communities that we serve. The JENs are employee-led and organized, partnering with leadership to shape an inclusive organization and ensure everyone feels that they belong.\nOur global Action Plan for Advancing Justice and Equality sets out actionable initiatives and measurable objectives to address racial inequalities both within Jacobs and in communities across the world. The plan is about achieving true equality for all our employees current and future, with a focus on empowering our Black employees to advance and achieve at Jacobs. It's about doing our part as a global leader to educate and change the culture in our communities — reaching future talent early to highlight and celebrate their potential.\nWe maintain agile and disciplined capital deployment\nM&A and Divestitures\nConsistent with our profitable growth strategy, Jacobs pursues acquisitions, divestitures, strategic investments and other transactions to maximize long-term value by continuing to reshape its portfolio to higher value solutions and accelerating its profitable growth strategy. The company has made the following recent acquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures:\nPage 8\n•\nOn November 19, 2021, Jacobs consummated its previously announced acquisition of BlackLynx (\"BlackLynx\"). Pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), Jacobs acquired all of BlackLynx's outstanding shares of common stock, in a transaction valued at up to $257.5 million, on a cash-free, debt-free basis, including base consideration of $250 million, and a potential earn-out payment of up to $7.5 million. The amount of any earnout payment will depend on BlackLynx achieving certain revenue and gross margin thresholds in calendar year 2022. The purchase price was paid in cash and is subject to customary post-closing adjustments.\n•\nOn March 2, 2021, Jacobs completed the strategic investment of a 65% interest in PA Consulting, a UK-based leading innovation and transformation consulting firm. The total consideration paid by the Company was $1.7 billion, funded through cash on hand, a new term loan and draws on the Company's existing revolver. The remaining 35% interest is held by PA Consulting employees.\n•\nOn November 24, 2020, Jacobs completed the acquisition of Buffalo Group, a leader in advanced cyber and intelligence solutions.\n•\nOn March 6, 2020, Jacobs acquired the nuclear consulting, remediation and program management business of John Wood Group (\"John Wood Group\" or \"Wood Group\"), a U.K.-based energy services company.\n•\nOn June 12, 2019, Jacobs acquired The KeyW Holding Corporation (“KeyW”), a U.S.-based national security technology solutions provider to the intelligence, cyber, and counterterrorism communities.\n•\nOn April 26, 2019, Jacobs completed the sale of its Energy, Chemicals and Resources (\"ECR\") business to Worley Limited, a company incorporated in Australia (\"Worley\"), for a purchase price of $3.4 billion consisting of (i) $2.8 billion in cash plus (ii) 58.2 million ordinary shares of Worley, subject to adjustments for changes in working capital and certain other items (the “ECR sale”). ECR provided engineering and construction services mainly for energy, chemicals and resources sectors. With the sale of ECR, the Company has exited direct hire construction and fixed price lump sum energy-related construction.\n•\nOn December 15, 2017, Jacobs acquired CH2M, a provider of consulting and other services in the water, environmental, transportation and nuclear remediation sectors.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Company repurcha\nsed $274.9 million in shares.\nShareholder Dividends\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Company paid dividen\nds of $.19 per share in the first quarter and $.21 per share in the second, third and fourth quarters.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business\nIn fiscal 2021, demand for certain of our services, including those supporting health care relief efforts relating to COVID-19, increased as a result of COVID-19. Notwithstanding our continuing critical operations, COVID-19 negatively impacted parts of our business, and may have further adverse impacts on our continued operations, including those listed and discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Looking ahead, we have developed contingency plans to reduce costs further if the situation further deteriorates or lasts longer than current expectations. We continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be necessary or appropriate for the health and safety of employees, contractors, customers, suppliers or others or as required by international, federal, state or local authorities.\nBased on current estimates, we expect the impact of COVID-19 to continue through fiscal 2022, although to a lesser degree than what was seen in fiscal 2021 and 2020. Although this business disruption is expected to be temporary, significant uncertainty exists concerning the magnitude, duration and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including with regard to the effects on our customers, customer demand for our services and supply chain. Accordingly, actual results for future fiscal periods could differ materially versus current expectations and current results and financial condition discussed herein may not be indicative of future operating results and trends.\nLooking forward to the future of work, we are embracing and rethinking how we will work differently - honing our capabilities to better help our clients adjust, innovate and implement. Our reimagined solutions drive resilient outcomes now through the pandemic to what comes next as the world changes and we face other unprecedented challenges.\nPage 9\nFor a discussion of risks and uncertainties related to COVID-19, including the potential impacts on our business, financial condition and results of operations, see Item 1A -\nRisk Factors\n.\nPage 10\nLines of Business\nThe services we provide fall into the following two lines of business (LOB): Critical Mission Solutions (CMS), People & Places Solutions (P&PS) and a majority investment in PA Consulting (PA), which are also the Company’s reportable segments. For additional information regarding our segments, including information about our financial results by segment and financial results by geography, see Note 20 -\nSegment Information\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Mission Solutions (CMS)\nOur Critical Mission Solutions line of business provides a full spectrum of cyber, data analytics, systems and software application integration services and consulting, enterprise level operations and maintenance and mission IT, engineering and design, enterprise operations and maintenance, program management, and other highly technical consulting solutions to government agencies as well as commercial customers and international markets. Our representative clients include the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the Combatant Commands, the U.S. Intelligence Community, NASA, the U.S. Department of Energy (DoE), U.K. Ministry of Defence, the U.K. Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), and the Australian Department of Defence, as well as private sector customers mainly in the aerospace, automotive, energy and telecom sectors.\nServing mission-critical end markets\nCritical Mission Solutions serves broad sectors, including U.S. government services, cyber, nuclear, commercial and international sectors.\nFiscal Year 2021\nThe U.S. Government is the world’s largest buyer of technical services, and in fiscal 2021, approximately 74% of CMS’s revenue was earned from serving the DoD, Intelligence Community and Federal Civilian governmental entities.\nTrends affecting our government clients include information warfare, cyber, IT modernization, space exploration and intelligence, defense systems and intelligent asset management, which are driving demand for our highly technical solutions.\nPage 11\nAnother trend we are witnessing is an increase in the capabilities of unmanned aircraft and hypersonic weapons, which is impacting both offensive and defensive spending priorities among our clients and is a driver for next generation solutions such as C5ISR (command, control, communications, computer, combat systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) and advanced aeronautical testing, respectively. We are also seeing an increase in space exploration initiatives both from the U.S. government, such as NASA’s Artemis program to return to the moon in 2024, as well as the commercial sector.\nWithin the nuclear sector, our customers have decades-long initiatives to manage, upgrade, decommission and remediate existing energy infrastructure and nuclear defense facilities.\nOur international customers, which accounted for 18% of fiscal 2021 revenue, have also increased demand for our IT and cybersecurity solutions and nuclear projects, and the U.K. Ministry of Defence continues to focus on accelerating its strategic innovative and technology focused initiatives.\nLeveraging our base market of offering valued technical services to U.S. government customers, CMS also serves commercial markets. In fiscal 2021, approximately 8% of CMS’s revenue was from various U.S. commercial sectors, including the telecommunications sector, which anticipates a large cellular infrastructure build-out from 4G to 5G technology. And like our government facility-based clients, our commercial manufacturing clients are seeking ways to reduce maintenance costs and optimize their facilities with network connected facilities and equipment to optimize operational systems, which we refer to as Intelligent Asset Management.\nPage 12\nPeople & Places Solutions (P&PS)\nJacobs' People & Places Solutions line of business provides end-to-end solutions for our clients’ most complex challenges – whether climate change, energy transition, connected mobility, integrated water management, smart cities or vaccine manufacturing. In doing so, we incorporate the full spectrum of data science and technology-enabled toolsets within a people-centric solution development and delivery framework. We embrace inclusive engagement of partners and stakeholders and generate enduring social equity/value through consulting, planning, architecture, design and engineering project outcomes, as well as long-term operation of facilities and infrastructure. Solutions may be delivered as standalone engagements or through comprehensive program management that integrates disparate workstreams to yield additional benefits not attainable through project-by-project implementation. We also provide progressive design-build and construction management at-risk delivery solutions in targeted markets.\nOur clients include national, state and local government in the U.S., Europe, U.K., Middle East, Australia, New Zealand and Asia, as well as multinational private sector clients throughout the world.\nFiscal Year 2021\nServing broad industry sectors that support people and places\nAging infrastructure; climate action; urbanization; water, food and energy security; global supply chains; pandemic preparedness and response; environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG); and digital transformation are driving new challenges and opportunities for our clients. These drivers are highlighting the need for holistic, integrated technology solutions that draw on the domain knowledge in the multidisciplinary consulting and delivery expertise of our global workforce. For example, an airport is no longer simply aviation infrastructure but is now a smart city with extensive operational, cybersecurity and autonomous mobility requirements, as well as the contactless travel requirements necessary to best manage COVID-19. Master planning for a city now requires advanced analytics to plan for climate adaption and next-generation mobility as well as revenue generating fiber infrastructure. The future of nearly all water infrastructure will be highly technology-enabled, leveraging solutions with digital twins, predictive analytics and smart metering technology to ensure we're giving communities, industries and regions the secure water resource they need to flourish and expand.\nPage 13\nThis increase in technology requirements is a key factor in our organic growth strategy as well as our recent acquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures. Our business model is evolving to provide a broader spectrum of digital- and technology-enabled solutions to address our infrastructure clients' challenges with less exposure to craft construction services. Our focus on the five core sectors of Transportation, Water, Built Environment, Environmental and Advanced Facilities provides us with the ability to leverage our expansive domain expertise across all global markets, enabling truly end-to-end connected solutions for our clients' most complex major projects and programs, including Expo 2020 Dubai, the Thames Estuary Asset Management (TEAM 2100) and the LaGuardia Airport Redevelopment.\nA strong foundation of data-rich innovative solutions is woven into every project that we deliver. This may include Jacobs-developed proprietary software that employs an array of technical expertise to enable the most efficient, effective and predictable solutions for our clients.\nPA Consulting (PA)\nJacobs invested in a 65% stake in PA, the consultancy that is Bringing Ingenuity to Life. Its diverse teams of experts combine innovative thinking and breakthrough use of technologies to progress further, faster. PA’s clients adapt and transform and achieve enduring results. An innovation and transformation consultancy, PA's roughly 3,300 employees work across seven sectors: consumer and manufacturing, defense and security, energy and utilities, financial services, government, health and life sciences, and transport. PA people are strategists, innovators, designers, consultants, digital experts, scientists, engineers and technologists. The team operates globally from offices across the U.K., U.S., Nordics and the Netherlands.\nPA offers end-to-end innovation, accelerating new growth ideas from concept, through design, development, and to commercial success, and revitalizing organizations, building the leadership, culture, systems and processes to make innovation a reality. The company has a diverse mix of private and public sector clients, from global household names to start-ups, to national and local public services.\nJacobs and PA recognize that unprecedented changes in society and technology are creating new opportunities to make a positive impact, and together, the companies are supporting clients to address five key trends: product and service innovation; the future of work; sustainability and climate change; the quest to lead healthier lives; and the challenges of keeping people (and the organizations they work for) safe. PA’s distinct brand, market positioning and competitive differentiation positions the company well to help clients respond and seize new opportunities.\nPA led the efforts to design, manufacture and distribute thousands of lifesaving ventilators as part of the U.K. Ventilator Challenge, and has continued to support the U.K. Government’s COVID-19 response throughout 2021. Other work during 2021 includes re-designing the U.K. Army’s Operating Model, working as the Home Office’s Software Engineering partner for border safety, and working with the U.K. MOD’s Defence Science & Technology Laboratory and the Danish National Genome Center.\nPage 14\nRecently, PA has been appointed by the U.K. Government to design an iconic electric vehicle charge point to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles. And PA and Jacobs together announced a joint framework win, with the U.K.’s Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, for business transformation and delivery.\nPA has seen growth projects across key industries within the private sector, including Consumer & Manufacturing, Health & Life Sciences, Transportation and Financial Services.\nEnergy, Chemicals and Resources (ECR)\nECR Disposition\nOn April 26, 2019, Jacobs completed the sale of its Energy, Chemicals and Resources (ECR) business to Worley Limited, a company incorporated in Australia (Worley), for a purchase price of $3.4 billion consisting of (i) $2.8 billion in cash plus (ii) 58.2 million ordinary shares of Worley, subject to adjustments for changes in working capital and certain other items (the ECR sale).\nAs a result of the ECR sale, substantially all ECR-related assets and liabilities were sold (the \"Disposal Group\"). We determined that the disposal group should be reported as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 210-05,\nDiscontinued Operations\nbecause their disposal represents a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. As such, the financial results of the ECR business are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additionally, assets and liabilities of the ECR business were reflected as held-for-sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets through September 27, 2019. As of the year ended October 2, 2020, all of the ECR business to be sold under the terms of the sale has been conveyed to Worley and as such, no amounts remained held for sale. For further discussion, see Note 16-\nSale of Energy, Chemicals and Resources (\"ECR\") Business\nto the consolidated financial statements.\nSignificant Customers\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the U.S. federal government for each of the last three fiscal years:\nGiven the percentage of total revenue derived directly from the U.S. federal government, the loss of U.S. federal government agencies as customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be disallowed. Approximately 83% of revenue derived directly from the U.S. federal government is in the CMS segment. For more information on risks relating to our government contracts, see Item 1A -\nRisk Factors.\nContracts\nWhile there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake, our contracts generally fall into two broad categories: cost-reimbursable and fixed-price. The following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last three fiscal years:\nIn accordance with industry practice, most of our contracts (including those with the U.S. federal government) are subject to termination at the discretion of the client, which is discussed in greater detail in\nItem 1A - Risk Factors\n. In such situations, our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination.\nPage 15\nCost-Reimbursable Contracts\nCost-reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit. The profit element may be in the form of a simple mark-up applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee, or a combination of a mark-up and a fee. The fee element can also take several forms. The fee may be a fixed amount; it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred; or it may be an incentive fee based on targets, milestones, or performance factors defined in the contract.\nFixed-Price Contracts\nFixed-price contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixed-price” contracts. Under lump sum bid contracts, we typically bid against competitors based on client-furnished specifications. This type of pricing presents certain inherent risks, including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received, problems with new technologies, and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period. Additionally, it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients, which is contrary to our relationship-based business model. Accordingly, lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract. In contrast, under a negotiated fixed-price contract, we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client. Negotiated fixed-price contracts frequently exist in single-responsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project. Thus, although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client, the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us in our services contracts as well as construction. However, because of economies that may be realized during the contract term, both negotiated fixed-price and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts. The Company carefully manages the risk inherent in these types of contracts. In recent years, most of our fixed-price work has been either negotiated fixed-price contracts or lump sum bid contracts for design and/or project services, rather than turnkey construction.\nCompetition\nWe compete with a large number of companies across the world including technology consulting, federal IT services, aerospace, defense and engineering firms. Typically, no single company or companies dominate the markets in which we provide services and in many cases we partner with our competitors or other companies to jointly pursue projects. AECOM, Booz Allen, CACI, KBR, Leidos, Parsons, SAIC, Tetra Tech, WSP, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Accenture, Stantec, Montrose, Capgemini, Cognizant, DXC Technology, Fluor, 3LHarris,  Quanta Services, SNC-Lavalin, IBM, Infosys, Deloitte, KPMG, PwC, ICF International and Huron are some of our competitors. We compete based on the following factors, among others: technical capabilities, reputation for quality, price of services, safety record, availability of qualified personnel, and ability to timely perform work and contract terms.\nHuman Capital Management\nAt Jacobs, our people are the heart of our business. With our culture of caring and inclusion as our foundation, we celebrate the differences that drive our collective strength and encourage our employees that there is no limit to who they can be and what we can achieve. Together we deliver extraordinary solutions for a better tomorrow and live by our employee value statement: Jacobs. A world where you can.\nAs of October 1, 2021, we had a workforce of approximately 55,000 people worldwide, including a contingent workforce of approximately 3,000 people. The breakdown of our employees by region is as follows:\nAttracting, Engaging and Developing our Workforce\nThe success of Jacobs is dependent on our ability to hire, retain, engage and leverage highly qualified employees, across the full spectrum of technical, professional, scientific and consulting disciplines. We put the spotlight on ensuring that Jacobs is an employer of choice in every way: we are a merit-based organization that is inclusive and diverse; we are\nPage 16\nbuilding an inclusive culture where all employees feel they belong. Our culture is the foundation for selecting, developing and retaining the best and brightest minds at Jacobs. Our eight Jacobs Employee Networks play a critical role in attracting new talent into our business, helping to shape our recruiting strategies and policies, our science, technology, engineering, arts and math (STEAM) programs, and our accessibility practices. In fiscal 2021, more than1,900 graduates, interns and apprentices were welcomed to our global team; making a total of approximately 3,500 early career talent working with us.\nIn fiscal year 2021, our people took the time to share honest, unfiltered feedback in our confidential culture survey. The results were overwhelmingly positive, with the majority of respondents feeling connected to our values, inspired by our culture of integrity, safety, and inclusion — and proud to be part of Jacobs. We shared six priority areas, along with a set of dynamic dashboards, enabling all employees to see survey data relevant to them.\nOur unique employee experience platform – e3: engage. excel. elevate. – is not just a system but a mindset for developing our employees through continuous feedback and celebrations, aligning priorities, learning new skills and upskilling knowledge. To date, 97% of our employees have participated in their current annual conversation about their priorities and accomplishments. In fiscal year 2021, we launched 1,696 new courses across ten learning spaces, including our new Advocate & Ally development program. In partnership with the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, we launched the Climate Solutions Accelerator online course to employees to help them understand the role they can play in climate change action and continue to develop the critical green skills and solutions needed for our continually evolving world. We expanded our Executive Leadership Program, developed by Jacobs in partnership with Duke Corporate Education, with 224 of our next level leaders participating in our Amplif(i)3 Program. We accelerated talent development in creating sustainable solutions through our participation in the UN Global Compact Young SDG Innovators program. And, we published our No Harassment, Discrimination, Bullying and Violence Policy on our external Jacobs website.\nFocus on Inclusion and Diversity\nAt Jacobs we have an unparalleled focus on inclusion, with a diverse team of visionaries, thinkers and doers. We embrace all perspectives, collaborating to make a positive impact. Joining, belonging and thriving are Jacobs’ key elements in retaining talent and developing a culture where people want to stay – and a place where you can bring your best, whole self to work.\nTogetherBeyond\n℠\nis our approach to living inclusion every day and enabling diversity and equity globally – it is not just about numbers and statistics, but about every one of our people and the collective strength we take from their unique perspectives and ambitions.\nOperationalizing TogetherBeyond is supported by the strength of tangible leadership commitment and accountability at Jacobs. Our Board of Directors is  now 55% diverse, (race and gender) and our Executive Leadership Team is 67% diverse.\nHaving a culture of belonging where everyone can join in and thrive allows us to recruit and retain the best global talent and drive innovative solutions for our business, clients and communities. Through TogetherBeyond, we tackle topics that are important to our employees such as equality, unconscious bias and allyship. While providing training and resources to our people is important – over 97% of them have completed our Advocate & Ally inclusion learning program – equally effective are the regular authentic and courageous conversations our grassroots employee networks are creating around these topics.\nWe are committed to holding all leaders accountable to making sure that broad based  diversity is reflected in their own teams, using data analytics to measure our progress with the same rigor and transparency as our financial performance metrics. Inclusive behaviors are now a key formal component of all our leaders’ performance and salary reviews, and all leaders at Vice President level and above are required to mentor two or more junior members of staff, at least one of whom must have different lived a experience from themselves (i.e. on the basis of ethnicity, gender, race, geography, disability, sexuality or veteran status). This framework supports our Global Action Plan for Advancing Justice and Equality and our 2025 aspirational 40:40:20 goal (40% men, 40% women and 20% any gender) — and ensures that we are propelling a new generation of diverse visionary thinkers throughout our company.\nPage 17\nAs of October 1, 2021, our U.S. employees had the following race and ethnicity demographics:\nOur focus on creating equal opportunities within Jacobs, including as to historically underrepresented groups, continues to increase as we deliver on the promises laid out in our Global Action Plan for Advancing Justice and Equality launched in fiscal year 2020.\nIn partnership with McKinsey, nearly 300 talented employees are participating in their Connected Leaders Academy programs, which seek to create a unique learning environment and safe space for sharing common experiences, helping promising Black, Latinx and Asian employees build their network and become part of a new wave of Jacobs leaders.\nOur Black and Latinx employee networks, Harambee and Enlace, continue to lead STEAM outreach efforts in the communities that we serve and are working to bring a new generation of diverse visionaries from underrepresented and underserved groups into the industry.\nAs of October 1, 2021, our global employees had the following gender demographics:\nU.S. combined diverse talent (ethnicity & female) was 47.4%. In partnership with our Women’s Network, we launched gender-balanced interview teams, provided flexible working arrangements, improved caregiver leave, rolled out our first domestic violence policy in Australia/NZ, piloted a “Male Champions of Change” allyship program and created “Bridge the Gap”, a program that actively support parents returning to work.\nWe are taking action in connection with our Prism network to ensure that our LGBTQ+ family can truly “bring their whole best self to work”, establishing gender-neutral restrooms, training HR specialists on transgender guidelines and ensuring U.S. healthcare plans are inclusive.\nThrough VetNet, our employee network for veterans, their families and current military reserve members, we continue to work to recruit, develop and retain the best military and veteran talent, partnering with key organizations like Hiring Our Heroes, Boots2Roots and HirePurpose. We were proud to receive the HIRE Vets Gold Medallion for Veteran Recruiting.\nOur One World employee network continues to celebrate cultures around the globe and to foster global connectivity, nurturing and supporting our diverse employees and clients across all ethnicities and cultures.\nOur ACE employee network connects and empowers members living with disability, health challenges or neurodiversity, and those who provide care to others. ACE embraces the social model of disability which aims to identify and remove the social, digital, and physical barriers that create exclusion in the workplace and society in general.\nPage 18\nThrough our Jacobs Careers Network (JCN), we empower every employee to maximize their potential and make Jacobs the industry leader and workplace of choice. JCN organizes and supports career-enriching development and networking opportunities in all our geographies.\nLooking ahead, we will continue to focus on inclusion, belonging and diversity by:\n•\nContinuing action through our global Action Plan for Advancing Justice and Equality\n•\nStriving to achieve our aspirational goals of creating a more gender-balanced and a more racially/ethnically diverse workforce around the globe to more appropriately reflect the labor markets and communities in which we live and serve\n•\nAmplifying our culture of belonging and helping all employees see the various communities they can engage with at Jacobs so that everyone has a sense of belonging\n•\nFollowing through on our six priority areas identified through our global culture survey\n•\nIdentifying, developing and promoting allies across Jacobs\nOur Employees’ Safety and Well-being\nAs global challenges to our security, well-being and ability to operate evolve, we stay focused on managing HSE and security risks effectively and leveraging our Culture of Caring℠ to deliver the best outcomes for our people, the environment and our company. Our new BeyondZero® strategy continues to drive a safer, more secure, healthier, and more resilient future for our Jacobs family, our communities and the environment. We are maturing our business continuity program to assure business delivery and resilience in an ever-changing operational environment.\nWe also continue to demonstrate safety excellence with another year of zero employee fatalities at work and a total recordable incident rate\n1\nof 0.21, compared to the North American Industry Classification System’s most recently reported\n2\naggregate rate of 0.70.\nOur new global well-being strategy integrates physical, mental, financial, social and workplace well-being for Jacobs employees and their families. The strategy includes Jacobs’ One Million Lives, developed in collaboration with global mental health professionals, to provide a free mental health check-in tool with a resources website that enable users to check their own mental health and access proactive strategies for personal mental health development.\nOver 14,000 One Million Lives check-ins were completed between December 2020 launch and our fiscal year end 2021.\nIn fiscal 2021, all vice presidents acknowledged and made a commitment to become BeyondZero Ambassadors and establish priorities to deliver the greatest impact through our BeyondZero strategy. More than 2,500 Positive Mental Health Champions (a 35% increase from fiscal year 2020) are now trained to support the mental well-being of our employees and one in every 21 employees is trained as a Positive Mental Health Champion. In addition, we launched Suicide Awareness Training through our e3 Learning.\nWe are committed to continue our work to create an inclusive and innovative organization and taking action to ensure Jacobs is, and remains, an employer of choice.\n1\nAs at October 15, 2021 and recorded in accordance with OSHA record keeping requirements, but subject to change thereafter due to possible injury/illness classification changes.\n2 Cited on October 5th, 2021 via U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\n- Incidence rates\nof non-fatal occupational injuries and illnesses by industry and case types, 2019 for NAICS code 5413XXX.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nThe information required by Paragraph (a), and Paragraphs (c) through (g) of Item 401 of Regulation S-K (except for information required by Paragraph (e) of that Item to the extent the required information pertains to our executive officers) and Item 405 of Regulation S-K is set forth under the caption “Members of the Board of Directors” in our definitive proxy statement to be filed with the SEC pursuant to Regulation 14A within 120 days after the close of our fiscal year and is incorporated herein by reference.\nPage 19\nThe following table presents the information required by Paragraph (b) of Item 401 of Regulation S-K.\nAll of the officers listed in the preceding table serve in their respective capacities at the pleasure of the Board of Directors of the Company.\nMr. Demetriou joined the Company in August 2015.

    "text": "We operate in a changing global environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future. We may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial. If any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of some of the risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\n•\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, including the measures that international, federal, state and local public health and other governmental authorities implement to address it, have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n•\nProject sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. Failure to maintain safe work sites by us, the owner or others working at the project site can lead to our employees or others becoming injured, disabled or even losing their lives, and exposes us to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities.\n•\nOur results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts.\n•\nWe engage in a highly competitive business. If we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\n•\nThe nature of our contracts, particularly those that are fixed-price, subjects us to risks of cost overruns. We may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses if costs increase above budgets or estimates or if the project experiences schedule delays.\n•\nThe contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, canceled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings. Additionally, even if fully performed, our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins.\n•\nContracts with the U.S. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance.\n•\nOur project execution activities may result in liability for faulty services.\n•\nThe outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and damage our reputation.\n•\nOur use of joint ventures, partnerships and strategic investments in entities exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control\n•\nEmployee, agent or partner misconduct, or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations, could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits.\n•\nOur international operations are exposed to additional risks and uncertainties, including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies.\n•\nCyber security or privacy breaches, or systems and information technology interruption or failure could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm.\n•\nWe are subject to professional standards, duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue, which could subject us to monetary damages.\n•\nIf we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n•\nOur actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements.\n•\nAn impairment charge on our goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nPage 21\n•\nWe may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and post-retirement benefit plans we manage or for which we have contribution and/or funding obligations.\n•\nDemand for our services is cyclical as the sectors and industries in which our clients operate are impacted by economic downturns, reductions in government or private spending and times of political uncertainty.\n•\nRising inflation, interest rates, and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed-price contracts.\n•\nOur global presence could give rise to material fluctuations in our income tax rates.\n•\nOur businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control.\n•\nOur continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel.\n•\nOur business strategy relies in part on acquisitions and strategic investments to sustain our growth. These transactions present certain risks and uncertainties.\n•\nOur professional reputation and relationships with U.S. government agencies are critical to our business, and any harm to our reputation or relationships could decrease the amount of business the U.S. government does with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n•\nOur focus on new growth areas for our business entails risks, including those associated with new relationships, clients, talent needs, capabilities, service offerings, and maintaining our collaborative culture and core values.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance\n•\nPast and future environmental, health, and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities.\n•\nIf we fail to comply with federal, state, local or foreign governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected.\n•\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nRisks Related to Climate Change\n•\nClimate change and related environmental issues could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n•\nWe may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change.\n•\nWe may be unable to achieve our climate commitments and targets.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\n•\nWe rely on cash provided by operations and liquidity under our credit facilities to fund our business. Negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could adversely affect our cost of borrowing and our business.\n•\nMaintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n•\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock.\n•\nThere can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock.\n•\nIn the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership, and if we receive stock in connection with a divestiture, the value of stock is subject to fluctuation.\nPage 22\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, including the measures that international, federal, state and local public health and other governmental authorities implement to address it, have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDespite the availability of vaccines in some geographies, COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the United States and globally, including in regions where we have significant operations and personnel, and uncertainties exist as to the efficacy of vaccines against new variants or mutations of COVID-19. To attempt to mitigate the spread of the pandemic, there have been extraordinary and wide-ranging actions taken by international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak of COVID-19 in regions across the United States and around the world. These actions include quarantines and “stay-at-home” or “shelter-in-place” orders, social distancing measures, travel restrictions, school closures and similar mandates for many individuals in order to substantially restrict daily activities and orders for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations unless their work is critical, essential or life-sustaining and to require their employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 as a condition for continued employment. Although there has been an easing of restrictions in certain jurisdictions, some of these restrictions have been reinstated in other jurisdictions, or could be reinstated in the future, to manage a resurgence or new outbreak of COVID-19, including in connection with new variants or mutations of the virus. In addition, the reopening of businesses and economies in certain countries is creating a variety of new challenges, including, for example, higher prices for goods and services, limited availability of products, and disruptions to supply chains. As such, the duration, severity of its effects and ultimate impact to the world’s population and the global economy are still unknown.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, certain elements of our business, including, but not limited to, the following:\n•\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, reductions in demand for certain of our services and the delay or abandonment of ongoing or anticipated projects due to our clients’, suppliers’ and other third parties’ diminished financial conditions or financial distress, as well as governmental budget constraints. These impacts are expected to continue or worsen if “stay-at-home”, “shelter-in-place”, social distancing, travel restrictions and other similar orders, measures or restrictions remain in place for an extended period of time or are re-imposed after being lifted or eased. Although we have experienced, and may continue to experience, an increase in demand for certain of our services as a result of new projects that have arisen in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that any such increased demand would be sufficient to offset lost or delayed demand.\n•\nGovernment-sponsored stimulus or assistance programs enacted to-date in the United States and in the foreign countries in which we operate in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have only been available to us or our customers or suppliers on a limited basis and are insufficient to address the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  These and other government-sponsored assistance and stimulus programs are subject to renewal, modification or termination by the applicable governing bodies. If any government-sponsored program from which we receive benefits is modified or terminated, our benefits thereunder could decline or cease altogether, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows.\n•\nOur clients may be unable to meet their payment obligations to us in a timely manner, including as a result of deteriorating financial condition or bankruptcy resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic impacts. Further, other third parties, such as suppliers, subcontractors, joint venture partners and other outside business partners, may experience significant disruptions in their ability to satisfy their obligations with respect to us, or they may be unable to do so altogether.\n•\nWhile we have begun voluntary phased re-openings in our offices in accordance with guidance provided by government agencies, the majority of our employees are currently still working remotely. Although many of our employees can effectively perform their responsibilities while working remotely, some work is not well-suited for remote work, and that work may not be completed as efficiently as if it were performed on site. Additionally, we may be exposed to unexpected cybersecurity risks and additional information technology-related expenses as a result of these remote working requirements. In addition, our management team has spent, and will likely continue to spend, significant time, attention and resources monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and seeking to manage its effects on our business and workforce.. A long-term continuation of these restrictions could, among other things, negatively impact employee morale and productivity. Any failure to\nPage 23\npreserve our culture could harm our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel, innovate and operate effectively and execute on our business strategy.\n•\nConsistent with public health guidance and Executive Order 14042 mandating COVID-19 vaccination for employees of businesses servicing federal contracts, we have announced a Company policy requiring full COVID-19 vaccinations of all employees in the United States and Canada, except for employees who qualify for medical or religious exemptions. This policy, along with the federal vaccine mandate, may result in employee attrition and difficulty securing future labor needs, and could impair our ability to perform certain contractual services, to retain such contracts, and to win new business, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n•\nIllness, travel restrictions or other workforce disruptions could adversely affect our supply chain, our ability to timely and satisfactorily complete our clients’ projects, our ability to provide services to our clients or our other business processes. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we could experience a longer-term impact on our operating expenses, including, for example, the need for enhanced health and hygiene requirements or the periodic revival of social distancing or other measures in one or more regions in attempts to counteract future outbreaks.\n•\nWe may experience difficulties associated with hiring additional employees or replacing employees, in particular with respect to roles that require security clearances or other special qualifications that may be limited or difficult to obtain, as well as with effectively training and integrating new employees, and in the short term, to do so remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased turnover rates of our employees could increase operating costs and create challenges for us in maintaining high levels of employee awareness of, and compliance with, our internal procedures and external regulatory compliance requirements, in addition to increasing our recruiting, training and supervisory costs.\n•\nIn addition to existing travel restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, jurisdictions may continue to close borders, impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity, which could materially impair our ability to support our operations and clients (both domestic and international), to source supplies through the global supply chain and to identify, pursue and capture new business opportunities, and which could continue to restrict the ability of our employees to access their workplaces. We also face the possibility of increased overhead or other expenses resulting from compliance with any current and future government orders or other measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n•\nWe operate in many countries around the world, and certain of those countries’ governments may be unable to effectively mitigate the financial or other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on their economies and workforces and our operations therein.\nThe continued global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses thereto are complex and rapidly evolving, and the extent to which the pandemic impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the duration and magnitude of such impacts, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess. COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, as well as reactions to future pandemics or resurgences of COVID-19, could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we identify in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. There may be other adverse consequences to our business, financial condition and results of operations from the spread of COVID-19 that we have not considered or have not become apparent. As a result, we cannot assure you that if COVID-19 continues to spread, it would not have a further adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProject sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. Failure to maintain safe work sites by us, the owner or others working at the project site can lead to our employees or others becoming injured, disabled or even losing their lives, and exposes us to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities.\nProject sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes and highly regulated materials, in a challenging environment and often in geographically remote locations. The failure by us or others working at such sites to implement safety procedures or the implementation of ineffective procedures, or the failure to implement and follow appropriate safety procedures, subjects our employees and others to the risk of injury, disability or loss of life, and subjects us to risk that the completion or commencement of our projects may be delayed and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations. Unsafe work sites\nPage 24\nalso have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating and insurance costs. Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, and we are subject to the risk that the improper handling or disposal of such materials can lead to civil and/or criminal liabilities. We are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. Although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety and environmental (“HSE”) work procedures throughout our organization, including project sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability. In addition, despite the work of our functional groups, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel or that there will be no damage to or loss of our work, equipment or supplies.\nOur safety record is critical to our reputation. Many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures. Accordingly, if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards, we could suffer reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts.\nOur revenues are derived from new contract awards. Delays in the timing of the awards or cancellations of such projects as a result of economic conditions, material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could impact our long-term projected results. It is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will receive large-scale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process, which is affected by a number of factors, such as market conditions or governmental and environmental approvals. Since a significant portion of our revenues is generated from such projects, our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts. Furthermore, many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and, as a result, we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project.\nIn addition, many of our contracts require us to satisfy specific progress or performance milestones in order to receive payment from the customer. As a result, we often incur significant costs for engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor or subcontractors prior to receipt of payment from a customer.\nThe uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs. In some cases, we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards. When an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe engage in a highly competitive business. If we are unable to compete effectively, we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe face intense competition to provide technical, professional and construction management services to clients. The markets we serve are highly competitive and we compete against a large number of regional, national and multinational companies. The extent and type of our competition varies by industry, geographic area and project type.\nOur projects are frequently awarded through a competitive bidding process, which is standard in our industry. We are constantly competing for project awards based on pricing, schedule and the breadth and technical sophistication of our services. Competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins, which at times forces us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are less favorable to us, thereby increasing the risk that, among other things, we may not realize profit margins at the same rates as we have seen in the past or may become responsible for costs or other liabilities we have not accepted in the past. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both, which if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPage 25\nThe nature of our contracts, particularly those that are fixed-price, subjects us to risks of cost overruns. We may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses if costs increase above budgets or estimates or if the project experiences schedule delays.\nFor fiscal 2021, approximately 24% of our revenues were earned under fixed-price contracts. Both fixed-price and many cost reimbursable contracts require us to estimate the total cost of the project in advance of our performance. For fixed-price contracts, we may benefit from any cost-savings, but we bear greater risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. Fixed-price contracts are established in part on partial or incomplete designs, cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, commodity and other materials pricing and cost and availability of labor (including the cost of any related benefits or entitlements), equipment and materials and other exigencies. Cost overruns can occur, leading to reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project for a variety of reasons, including if the design or the estimates prove inaccurate or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather or other delays beyond our control, changes in the costs of equipment or raw materials, our vendors’ or subcontractors’ inability or failure to perform, or changes in general economic conditions. These risks are exacerbated for projects with long-term durations because there is an increased risk that the circumstances on which we based our original estimates will change in a manner that increases costs. If the project is significant, or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects, costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur contracts that are fundamentally cost reimbursable in nature may also present a risk to the extent the final cost on a project exceeds the amount the customer expected or budgeted. Like fixed-price contracts, the expected cost of cost-reimbursable projects is based in part on partial design and our estimates of the resources and time necessary to perform such contracts. A portion of the fee is often linked to these estimates and the related final cost and schedule objectives, and if for whatever reason these objectives are not met, the project may be less profitable than we expect or even result in losses.\nIf we, or any of our subsidiaries or companies in which we have made strategic investments, lose, or experience a significant reduction in, business from one or a few customers, it could have a material adverse impact on us.\nA few clients have in the past, and may in the future, account for a significant portion of our revenue and/or backlog, or the revenue and/or backlog for our subsidiaries or companies in which we have made strategic investments\n,\nin any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For example, in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, approximately 33%, 33% and 27%, respectively, of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the U.S. federal government. Although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, delay or cancel their contracts at any time. If we, or any of our subsidiaries or companies in which we have made strategic investments, lose, or experience a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe contracts in our backlog may be adjusted, canceled or suspended by our clients and, therefore, our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings. Additionally, even if fully performed, our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins.\nBacklog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. As of the end of fiscal 2021, our backlog totaled approximately $26.6 billion. There is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or, if realized, will result in profits. In accordance with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation, termination, or suspension at the discretion of the client, including our U.S. government work. In the event of a project cancellation, we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog. Projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project. The risk of contracts in backlog being canceled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices.\nThe contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts. The revenue for certain contracts included in backlog is based on estimates. Additionally, the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence, future profitability.\nIn some markets, there is a continuing trend towards cost-reimbursable contracts with incentive-fee arrangements. Typically, our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs, overall\nPage 26\nsafety performance, overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria. If we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards, we may receive a lower, or even zero, incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog, assuming they produce the revenues currently expected, will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past.\nContracts with the U.S. federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance.\nContracts with the U.S. federal government and other governments and their agencies, which are a significant source of our revenue and profit, are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions, and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as profit and cost controls, which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us. Government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration and budget deficits. Contracts with the U.S. federal government, for example, are subject to the uncertainties of Congressional funding. U.S. government shutdowns or any related under-staffing of the government departments or agencies that interact with our business could result in program cancellations, disruptions and/or stop work orders, could limit the government’s ability to effectively progress programs and make timely payments, and could limit our ability to perform on our existing U.S. government contracts and successfully compete for new work. Governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level, and funds for government programs may even be eliminated. Legislatures typically appropriate funds on a year-by-year basis, while contract performance may take more than one year. The U.S. government may also shift its spending focus away from areas, such as defense and space exploration, and towards other areas in which we do not currently provide services. As a result, contracts with government agencies may be only partially funded or may be terminated, and we may not realize all of the potential revenue and profit from those contracts.\nOur government clients may reduce the scope of or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice. Since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues (for example, those with the U.S. federal government represented approximately 33% of our total revenue in fiscal 2021), a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMost government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process. The U.S. federal government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contracts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract. This process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs. Moreover, we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minorities. Our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio-economic requirements, which affect how we transact business with our clients and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations. For example, for contracts with the U.S. federal government, we must comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Cost Accounting Standards, and numerous regulations governing environmental protection and employment practices. Government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. This includes, for example, unlimited indemnification obligations.\nWe also are subject to government audits, investigations, and proceedings. For example, government agencies such as the U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations. These audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies.\nIf we violate a rule or regulation, fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit, a variety of penalties can be imposed on us including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. For example, in so-called “qui tam” actions brought by individuals or the government under the U.S. Federal False Claims Act or under similar state and local laws, treble damages can be awarded. In addition, any or all of our government contracts could be terminated, we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work, or payment of our costs could be\nPage 27\ndisallowed. The occurrence of any of these actions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances, which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain. If our employees or our facilities are unable to obtain or retain the necessary security clearances, our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur project execution activities may result in liability for faulty services.\nFailure to provide our services in accordance with applicable professional standards or contractual requirements exposes us to significant monetary damages or even criminal violations. Our engineering practice, for example, involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects. While we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages in our contracts, and although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability and warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm, especially if public safety is impacted. These liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate, may not be covered by insurance at all due to various exclusions in our coverage and could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future. Further, even where coverage applies, the policies have limits and deductibles or retentions, which results in our assumption of exposure for certain amounts with respect to any claim filed against us. In addition, clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us. An uninsured claim, either in part or in whole, as well as any claim covered by insurance but subject to a policy limit, high deductible and/or retention, if successful and of a material magnitude, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and damage our reputation.\nWe are a party to claims and litigation in the normal course of business, including litigation inherited through acquisitions. Since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others, we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation and investigations due to the failure at any such facility or project. Such claims could relate to, among other things, personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage, or pollution and environmental damage, and be brought by our clients or third parties, such as those who use or reside near our clients’ projects. We can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met. In many of our contracts with clients, subcontractors and vendors, we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages, penalties, losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts. In addition, while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities, such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us.\nWith a workforce of approximately 55,000 people globally, we are also party to labor and employment claims in the normal course of business. Certain of these claims relate to allegations of harassment and discrimination, pay equity, denial of benefits, wage and hour violations, whistleblower protections, concerted protected activity, and other employment protections, and may be pursued on an individual or class action basis depending on applicable laws and regulations. Some of such claims may be insurable, while other such claims may not.\nWe maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. Our insurance programs have varying coverage limits as well as exclusions for matters such as fraud, and insurance companies can, and sometimes do, attempt to deny claims for which we seek coverage. In addition, we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles, retentions and limits under these programs. As a result, we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured, or completely uninsured.\nAlthough in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, coverage that is more limited,  increased premium costs or higher deductibles and/or retentions. We monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we\nPage 28\nprocure insurance, which is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance. Our insurance is purchased from a number of the world's leading providers, often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements. If any of our third party insurers fail, abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us, then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted.\nIn addition, the nature of our business sometimes results in clients, subcontractors and vendors presenting claims to us for, among other things, recovery of costs related to certain projects. Similarly, we occasionally present change orders and claims to our clients, subcontractors and vendors for, among other things, additional costs exceeding the original contract price. If we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders, or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients, subcontractors and vendors, we will likely incur cost overruns, reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for a project. Further, these claims can be the subject of lengthy negotiations, arbitration or litigation proceedings, which could result in the investment of significant amounts of working capital pending the resolution of the relevant change orders and claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results. Additionally, irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders, the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant.\nLitigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur. Pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability, product liability, criminal liability, warranty obligations, default under our credit agreements and other liabilities which, to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and damage our reputation.\nOur use of joint ventures, partnerships and strategic investments in entities exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control.\nAs is common in our industry, we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures, partnerships, and similar arrangements. This situation exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients.\nFurther, we have limited ability to control the actions of our joint venture partners, including with respect to nonperformance, default, bankruptcy or legal or regulatory compliance. Our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships. If these circumstances occur, we may be liable for claims and losses attributable to the partner by operation of law or contract. These circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on the management effectiveness of our joint venture partners. Differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues, which could materially affect the business and operations of these ventures. In addition, in many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures, it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement. If we are not able to enforce our contractual rights, we may not be able to realize the benefits of the joint venture or we may be subject to additional liabilities.\nWe participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner. In these cases, we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture. These joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. To the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts.\nThird-party subcontractors we hire perform a significant amount of the work performed under our contracts. We also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for\nPage 29\nprojects. If we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project will be impaired. If we are not able to locate qualified third-party subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump sum or a fixed-price contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. If a subcontractor, supplier, or manufacturer fails to provide services, supplies, parts or equipment as required under a contract for any reason, or fails to provide such services, supplies, parts or equipment in accordance with applicable quality standards as required by the contract or regulation, we will be required to source these services, equipment, parts or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms, which could impact contract profitability and/or could result in claims against us for damages.\nWe are subject to disputes with our subcontractors from time to time relating to, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed, customer concerns about the subcontractor, or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract. In addition, faulty workmanship, equipment or materials would likely impact the overall project, which could result in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications.\nIn an uncertain or downturn economic environment, third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations. The inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party’s ability to provide materials, equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, a failure by a third party subcontractor, supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws, regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and, for government clients, could result in fines, penalties, suspension or even debarment being imposed on us, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEmployee, agent or partner misconduct, or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations, could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits.\nWe are subject to the risk of misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners, which could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct includes the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting, regulations pertaining to export control, environmental laws, employee wages, pay and benefits, and any other applicable laws or regulations. For example, we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters; if a security breach were to occur, our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited. The precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or acts of misconduct subjects us to the risk of fines and penalties, cancellation of contracts, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting, any of which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations are exposed to additional risks and uncertainties, including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies.\nFor fiscal 2021, approximately\n31% o\nf our revenue was earned from clients outside the U.S. Our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations, and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:\n•\nRecessions and other economic crises in other regions, such as Europe, or specific foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries;\n•\nDifficulties in staffing and managing foreign personnel and operations, including challenges related to logistics, communications and professional licensure of our international workforce;\n•\nUnexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements;\n•\nPotential non-compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, including anti-corruption, export control and anti-boycott laws and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations;\n•\nPotential non-compliance with regulations and evolving industry standards regarding consumer protection and data use and security, including the General Data Protection Regulation approved by the European Union;\nPage 30\n•\nLack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights;\n•\nExpropriation and nationalization of our assets in a foreign country;\n•\nRenegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts;\n•\nThe adoption of new, and the expansion of existing, trade or other restrictions;\n•\nEmbargoes, duties, tariffs or other trade restrictions, including sanctions;\n•\nGeopolitical developments that impact our or our clients’ ability to operate in a foreign country;\n•\nChanges in labor conditions;\n•\nActs of war, civil unrest, force majeure, and terrorism;\n•\nThe ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations;\n•\nSocial, political, and economic instability;\n•\nChanges to tax policy;\n•\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n•\nLimitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings; and\n•\nU.S. government policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we operate.\nThe lack of a well-developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights. In addition, military action, geopolitical shifts or continued unrest, particularly in the Middle East, impacts the supply or pricing of oil and could disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere and increase our security costs. Moreover, recent events, including change in U.S. trade policies and responsive changes in policy by foreign jurisdictions and similar geopolitical developments and uncertainty in the E.U., Asia and elsewhere, have increased levels of political and economic unpredictability globally, and may increase the volatility of global financial markets and the global and regional economies. To the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic, political and other conditions, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe work in international locations where there are high security risks, which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost.\nSome of our services are performed in high-risk locations, where the country or location is subject to political, social or economic risks, or war, terrorism or civil unrest. In those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. Despite these activities, in these locations, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors. Acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our operations, including disruptions resulting from the evacuation of personnel, cancellation of contracts, or the loss of key employees, contractors or assets.\nCyber security or privacy breaches, or systems and information technology interruption or failure could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm.\nWe rely heavily on computer, information and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business. From time to time, we experience system interruptions and delays. In the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems, the operation of such systems could be subjected to additional interruption or could result in the loss, corruption, or release of data. In addition, our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, force majeure events, telecommunications failures, power loss, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, malicious code, physical or electronic security breaches, intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error or similar events or disruptions. Any of these or other events could cause interruptions, delays, loss of critical and/or sensitive data or similar effects, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, protection of intellectual property and results of operations, as well as those of our clients.\nOur information technology systems, which have grown over time, including through acquisitions, are vulnerable to failure, malicious intrusion and attack. These systems have, and will continue to experience threats, including\nPage 31\nunauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, ransomware, phishing, organized cyber-attacks and other security problems and system disruptions, including unauthorized access to and disclosure of our and our clients’ proprietary or classified information. Such tactics have caused, and may also seek to cause in the future, payments due to or from the Company to be misdirected to fraudulent accounts, which may not be recoverable by the Company.\nWhile we have security measures and technology in place designed to protect our and our clients’ proprietary or classified information, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent all threats to our computer systems. If our security measures and technology fail as a result of a cyber-attack, other third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and someone obtains unauthorized access to our or our clients’ information, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches. Any of these events could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), the California Consumer Privacy Act, and other emerging U.S. state and global privacy laws pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and legal liability.\nWe continuously evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment, to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons. The implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. In addition, our systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. Systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to professional standards, duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue, which could subject us to monetary damages.\nWe issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards, duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services. For example, we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings. If a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible, we could be subject to significant monetary damages. In addition, our reports and other work product may need to comply with professional standards, licensing requirements, securities regulations and other laws and rules governing the performance of professional services in the jurisdiction where the services are performed. We could be liable to third parties who use or rely upon our reports and other work product even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties. These events could in turn result in monetary damages and penalties.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients.\nOur technology and intellectual property provide us, in certain instances, with a competitive advantage. Although we seek to protect our property through registration, licensing, contractual arrangements, security controls and similar mechanisms, we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or become obsolete. Trade secrets are generally difficult to protect. Our employees and contractors are subject to confidentiality obligations, but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information and/or infringement of our intellectual property. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the U.S. If we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us, our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced. Litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert leadership’s attention away from other aspects of our business.\nPage 32\nWe also hold licenses from third parties which may be utilized in our business operations. If we are no longer able to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nIf our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete, we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers. Our competitors may independently attempt to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies.\nOur clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property. There is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and, as a result, could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act, commonly called the Price-Anderson Act (“PAA”), is a U.S. federal law, which, among other things, regulates radioactive materials and the nuclear energy industry, including liability and compensation in the event of nuclear related incidents. The PAA provides certain protections and indemnification to nuclear energy plant operators and U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) contractors. The PAA protections and indemnification apply to us as part of our services to the U.S. nuclear energy industry and DOE for new facilities, maintenance, modification, decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear energy, weapons and research facilities.\nWe offer similar services in other jurisdictions outside the U.S. For those jurisdictions, varying levels of nuclear liability protection is provided by international treaties, and/or domestic laws, such as the Nuclear Liability and Compensation Act of Canada and the Nuclear Installations Act of the United Kingdom, insurance and/or assets of the nuclear installation operators (some of which are backed by governments) as well as under appropriate enforceable contractual indemnifications and hold-harmless provisions. These protections and indemnifications, however, may not cover all of our liability that could arise in the performance of these services. To the extent the PAA or other protections and indemnifications do not apply to our services, the cost of losses associated with liability not covered by the available protections and indemnifications, or by virtue of our loss of business because of these added costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements.\nIn preparing our financial statements, our leadership is required under U.S. GAAP to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimates by our leadership include:\n•\nRecognition of contract revenue, costs, profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting;\n•\nEstimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs;\n•\nRecognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims;\n•\nCollectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts;\n•\nEstimates of other liabilities, including litigation and insurance revenues/reserves and reserves necessary for self-insured risks;\n•\nAccruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves;\n•\nValuation of assets acquired, and liabilities, goodwill, and intangible assets assumed, in acquisitions and ongoing assessment of impairment;\n•\nValuation estimates for redeemable noncontrolling interests calculations;\n•\nValuation of stock-based compensation;\nPage 33\n•\nThe determination of liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs; and\n•\nIncome tax provisions and related valuation allowances.\nOur actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAn impairment charge on our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nBecause we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to test goodwill carried in our Consolidated Balance Sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach. We also assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets when indications of impairment are present based on expected future probability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to our overall operations. As of October 1, 2021, we had $7.20 billion of goodwill, representing 49.2% of our total assets of $14.63 billion. We have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the beginning of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit’s market value, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business, potential government actions toward our facilities and other factors.\nIf our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet, it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired. If the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value, we could be required to record an impairment charge. The amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. For a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing, please see Item 7-\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nbelow.\nImpairment of long-lived assets or restructuring activities may require us to record a significant charge to earnings.\nOur long-lived assets, including our lease right-of-use assets, equity investments and others, are subject to periodic testing for impairment. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow at the asset group level has resulted in, and could result in additional, impairment of our long-lived assets. Further changes in the business environment could lead to changes in the scope of operations of our business. These changes, including the closure of one or more offices, could result in restructuring and/or asset impairment charges. The COVID-19 pandemic raises the possibility of an extended global economic downturn which increase the risk of long-lived asset impairment charges.\nWe may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and post-retirement benefit plans we manage or for which we have contribution and/or funding obligations.\nWe have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy, over time, our underfunded benefit obligations, which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets. For example, as of October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020, our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $191.4 million and $400.4 million, respectively. See Note 13-\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional disclosure. In the future, our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates, pension plan asset performance and other factors. If we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans, our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are also a participating employer in various Multi-Employer Pension Plans (\"MEPPs\") associated with some of the work we perform on a union basis, which MEPPs are managed by third party trusts and over which we have no control, including as to how the MEPPs are managed or financial investment decisions are made.  If any of these MEPPs is underfunded, we could face the imposition of underfunded liability or withdrawal liability at a materially adverse level.\nPage 34\nNegotiations with labor unions and possible work actions could disrupt operations and increase labor costs and operating expenses.\nA certain portion of our work force has entered into, and additional portions may in the future enter into, collective bargaining agreements, which on occasion may require renegotiation. The outcome of future negotiations relating to union representation or collective bargaining agreements may not be favorable to the Company in that they may increase our operating expenses and lower our net income as a result of higher wages or benefit expenses. In addition, negotiations with unions diverts management attention and could disrupt operations, which may adversely affect our results of operations. If we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements, we may have to address the threat of union-initiated work actions, including work slowdowns and strikes. Depending on the nature of the threat or the type and duration of any work action, these actions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDemand for our services is cyclical as the sectors and industries in which our clients operate are impacted by economic downturns, reductions in government or private spending and times of political uncertainty.\nWe provide full spectrum technical and professional solutions to clients operating in a number of sectors and industries, including programs for various national governments, including the U.S. federal government; aerospace; automotive; pharmaceuticals and biotechnology; infrastructure; environmental and nuclear; buildings; smart cities; power; water; transportation; telecom and other general industrial and consumer businesses and sectors. These sectors and industries and the resulting demand for our services have been, and we expect will continue to be, cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control, including economic conditions and changes in client spending, particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty.\nUncertain global economic and political conditions may negatively impact our clients’ ability and willingness to fund their projects, including their ability to raise capital and pay, or timely pay, our invoices. These factors may also cause our clients to reduce their capital expenditures, alter the mix of services purchased, seek more favorable price and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services. For example, in the public sector, declines in state and local tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending. In addition, under such conditions, many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable. These conditions may reduce the demand for our services, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, uncertain economic and political conditions may make it difficult for our clients, our vendors, and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. For example, changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs during the former administration have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future of the global economy as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries. The increasing cost of steel and aluminum may impact client spending. We cannot predict the outcome of changing trade policies or other unanticipated political conditions, nor can we predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic recovery or downturn worldwide or in our clients’ markets. In addition, our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and, therefore, may not recover as quickly as the economy at large. Weak economic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. On November 15, 2021, President Biden signed into law the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.\nWhile the Act provides for funding in many of the markets in which the Company operates, the timing of the award of projects funded by the Act is uncertain, and the Company may not be able to obtain the expected benefits from the Act or any other infrastructure or stimulus spending.  Furthermore, if a significant portion of our clients or projects are concentrated in a specific geographic area or industry, our business may be disproportionately affected by negative trends or economic downturns in those specific geographic areas or industries.\nRegardless of economic or market conditions, investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost. Because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards, we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients’ markets and investment decisions. As a result, our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate.\nPage 35\nOur operations may be impacted by the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union.\nIn June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The U.K. formally exited the E.U. on January 30, 2020, pursuant to a withdrawal agreement between the U.K. government and the E.U. Upon its withdrawal, pursuant to an agreement reached between the U.K. and the E.U., a transition period came into effect, which ended on December 31, 2020, from which time the U.K. withdrew from the E.U. Single Market and Customs Union. On December 24, 2020, the E.U. and the U.K. agreed the terms of a trade and cooperation agreement which sets out the terms of their future relationship, which we refer to as the Trade Agreement. The Trade Agreement was approved by the U.K. Parliament, and applied provisionally until the end of April 2021, when the European Parliament approved the Trade Agreement. The Trade Agreement offers U.K. and E.U .businesses preferential access to each other’s markets, ensuring imported goods will be free of tariffs and quotas. However, economic relations between the U.K. and the E.U. will now be on more restricted terms than before and there remains uncertainty around the post-Brexit regulatory environment, as the provisions of the Trade Agreement do not cover the services sector.\nThese restrictions may adversely affect our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers, employees, and subcontractors, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The diverging regulatory environments also add additional complexity to our compliance programs. This uncertainty could cause significant economic disruption and further depress consumer confidence and the economy of the U.K. , which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs, terminate or reduce the scope of existing contracts, decrease or postpone currently planned contracts, or negotiate for more favorable deal terms, each of which may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRising inflation, interest rates, and/or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts, in particular with respect to our fixed-price contracts.\nRising inflation, interest rates, or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services. In addition, we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixed-price. Because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from cost-reimbursable type contracts (approximately 76% during fiscal 2021), the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor. However, if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixed-price and lump-sum work is more prevalent, inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future. Therefore, increases in inflation, interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nForeign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects.\nOur reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects (both positive and negative) that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, into the U.S. dollar. While we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures, we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk, particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. We attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative (hedging) instruments, when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts. These actions, however, may not always eliminate currency risk exposure. The governments of certain countries have or may in the future impose restrictive exchange controls on local currencies and it may not be possible for us to engage in effective hedging transactions to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in a particular currency. Based on fluctuations in currency, the U.S. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly. We may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries.\nPage 36\nOur global presence could give rise to material fluctuations in our income tax rates.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. An increase or decrease in our effective tax rate, or an ultimate determination that the Company owes more taxes than the amounts previously accrued, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control.\nExtraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, could negatively impact our ability to operate. As an example, from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weather-related delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixed-price contract; evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services; increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weather-related damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to job sites in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. We may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or man-made event, unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations. If we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or man-made catastrophe, our operations may be significantly affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations. In addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits.\nFluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers’ investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation, delays in existing work, or changes in the timing and funding of new awards.\nCommodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways. For example, for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil, gas, copper, or fertilizers, fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and, therefore, their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments. Furthermore, declines in commodity prices can negatively impact our business in regions whose economies are substantially dependent on commodity prices, such as the Middle East. To the extent commodity prices decline or fluctuate and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects, the demand for our services decreases, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCommodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects. Rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned, as well as those in progress, and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects. Cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain, and utilize qualified personnel.\nThe success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire, retain and utilize qualified personnel, including engineers, architects, designers, craft personnel and corporate leadership professionals who have the required experience and expertise at a reasonable cost. The market for these and other personnel is competitive. From time to time, it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise, and in the timeframe, demanded by our clients, or to replace such personnel when needed in a timely manner. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. Furthermore, some of our personnel hold government granted clearance that may be required to obtain government projects. If we were to lose some or all of these personnel, they would be difficult to replace. Loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, qualified technical and leadership personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects.\nIn addition, in the event that any of our key personnel retire or otherwise leave the Company, we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans, which requires devoting time and\nPage 37\nresources toward identifying and integrating new personnel into leadership roles and other key positions. If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business strategy relies in part on acquisitions and strategic investments to sustain our growth. These transactions present certain risks and uncertainties.\nOur business strategy involves growth through, among other things, the acquisition of, and strategic investments in, other companies. For example, we acquired CH2M in December 2017, KeyW in June 2019, John Wood Group’s nuclear business in March 2020 and Buffalo Group in November 2020, and we completed a strategic investment in PA Consulting in March 2021. These transactions present a number of risks, including:\n•\nAssumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the transaction was negotiated;\n•\nFailure of the target company to comply with U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations and/or contractual requirements with government clients;\n•\nValuation methodologies may not accurately capture the value of the target company's business;\n•\nFailure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth opportunities;\n•\nThe loss of key customers or suppliers, including as a result of any actual or perceived conflicts of interest;\n•\nDifficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, licenses and permits;\n•\nDifficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a single, integrated, and efficient business;\n•\nFor strategic investments in which we do not acquire 100% of the target company, the other equity holders may have consent rights over certain actions taken by the company;\n•\nIn the event a target company continues to operate as a standalone company, it may result in additional costs;\n•\nThe effects of diverting leadership’s attention from day-to-day operations to matters involving the integration of target companies;\n•\nPotentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations, strategic investments and/or divestitures;\n•\nPotential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition or investment or post-closing deterioration in the target company's business;\n•\nDifficulties relating to assimilating the leadership, personnel, benefits, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities;\n•\nDifficulties retaining key personnel of the target company;\n•\nIncreased burdens on our staff and on our administrative, internal control and operating systems, which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities;\n•\nDifficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to the target company;\n•\nIncreased financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls;\n•\nThe potential requirement for additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available, or if available, may not have favorable terms; and\n•\nThe risks discussed in this Item 1A. Risk Factors that may relate to the activities of the acquired business prior to the acquisition.\nWhile we may obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses and/or insurance that could mitigate certain of these risks, such rights may be difficult to enforce, the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity, or the insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses.\nIf our leadership is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy with respect to acquisitions and/or strategic investments, our operating results could be harmed. In addition, we may not realize the full benefits of an acquisition or strategic investments, including the synergies, cost savings, or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Moreover, we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability.\nPage 38\nIn addition, there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition or investment targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. Existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, may be insufficient to make acquisitions and/or strategic investments. Future acquisitions and/or strategic investments may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on attractive terms, or at all. Acquisitions and/or strategic investments may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced.\nAcquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures create various business risks and uncertainties during the pendency of the transaction.\nConsummation of any merger, strategic investment or divestiture is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including one or more of the following: (i) due diligence and its associated time and cost commitments, (ii) board and shareholder approval, (iii) regulatory approvals, (iv) the absence of any legal restraint that would prevent the consummation of the transaction, (v) the absence of material adverse conditions which can prevent the consummation of the transaction, and (vi) compliance with covenants and the accuracy of representations and warranties contained in the transaction agreement, among others. One or more of these conditions may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the transaction may not be consummated or may be significantly delayed. In such case, our ongoing business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline, particularly to the extent that the market price reflects a market assumption that the transaction will be consummated or will be consummated within a particular timeframe.\nFurthermore, most transactions require the Company to incur substantial expense associated with closing and if the transaction is not consummated, we will incur these expenses without realizing the expected benefits. The pursuit of the transaction will also require management attention and use of internal resources that would otherwise be focused on general business operations. In addition, customers’ uncertainty about the effect of the transaction may have an adverse effect on the ability to win customer contracts, or could cause existing clients to seek to change existing business relationships. Employee morale due to the uncertainties associated with the transaction could also be negatively affected. Any of the foregoing, or other risks arising in connection with a failure or delay in consummating a transaction, including the diversion of management attention or loss of other opportunities during the pendency of the transaction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may make minority investments that subject us to risks and uncertainties outside of our control.\nFrom time to time, the Company may make minority investments in the equity securities of companies that we do not control. Minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and/or compliance risks associated with the minority investment.\nTo the extent we hold only a minority equity interest in a company, we may lack affirmative control rights, which may diminish our ability to influence the company’s affairs in a manner intended to enhance the value of our investment in the company. We could incur losses if the majority stakeholders or the management of the company takes risks or otherwise acts in a manner that does not serve our interests.\nIn addition, we could be subject to reputational harm if the company in which the investment is made makes business, financial or management decisions with which we do not agree. These circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with management or employees of the company in which the investment is made, or its other stockholders.\nIn most cases, the companies in which we make investments will have indebtedness or equity securities, or may be permitted to incur indebtedness or to issue equity securities, that rank senior to our investment. We also may make investments in early-stage companies that depend on venture funding and are not profitable. In the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a company in which an investment is made, holders of debt instruments and securities ranking senior to our investment would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before distributions could be made in respect of our investment.\nWe may also enter into separate commercial arrangements with these companies, whether before, concurrently with, or after making such minority investment. In certain cases, the commercial arrangement may be a driving factor behind our investment. We cannot assure you that that the commercial arrangement will further our business strategy as we expected. We may not realize all the economic benefits expected from the commercial agreement, or realize the expected return on our investments.\nPage 39\nUnavailability or cancellation of third-party insurance coverage could increase our overall risk exposure as well as disrupt the management of our business operations.\nWe maintain insurance coverage from third-party insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits. If any of our third-party insurers fail, suddenly cancel our coverage or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage, then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses could increase, and the management of our business operations could be disrupted. In addition, there can be no assurance that any of our existing insurance coverage will be renewable upon the expiration of the coverage period or that future coverage will be affordable at the required limits.\nAssertions by third parties of infringement, misappropriation or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business, financial condition and operation results.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in technology industries. We may face from time to time, allegations that we or a supplier or customer have violated the rights of third parties, including patent, trademark, and other intellectual property rights. If, with respect to any claim against us for violation of third-party intellectual property rights, we are unable to prevail in the litigation or retain or obtain sufficient rights or develop non-infringing intellectual property or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely or cost-efficient basis, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAny infringement, misappropriation or related claims, whether or not meritorious, are time consuming, divert technical and management personnel, and are costly to resolve. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease utilizing products or services, or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us.\nOur professional reputation and relationships with U.S. government agencies are critical to our business, and any harm to our reputation or relationships could decrease the amount of business the U.S. government does with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the U.S. federal government. If our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed, our future revenue and growth prospects would be materially and adversely affected. Our reputation and relationship with the U.S. government is a key factor in maintaining and growing revenue under contracts with the U.S. government. Negative press reports regarding poor contract performance, employee misconduct, information security breaches, engagements in or perceived connections to politically or socially sensitive activities, or other aspects of our business, or regarding government contractors generally, could harm our reputation. In addition, to the extent our performance under a contract does not meet a U.S. government agency’s expectations, the client might seek to terminate the contract prior to its scheduled expiration date, provide a negative assessment of our performance to government-maintained contractor past-performance data repositories, fail to award us additional business under existing contracts or otherwise, and direct future business to our competitors. If our reputation or relationships with these agencies are negatively affected, or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason, such actions would decrease the amount of business that the U.S. government does with us, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur focus on new growth areas for our business entails risks, including those associated with new relationships, clients, talent needs, capabilities, service offerings, and maintaining our collaborative culture and core values.\nWe are focused on growing our presence in our addressable markets by: expanding our relationships with existing clients, developing new clients by leveraging our core competencies, further developing our existing capabilities and service offerings, creating new capabilities and service offerings to address our clients' emerging needs, and undertaking business development efforts focused on identifying near-term developments and long-term trends that may pose significant challenges for our clients. These efforts entail inherent risks associated with innovation and competition from other participants in those areas, potential failure to help our clients respond to the challenges they face, our ability to comply with uncertain evolving legal standards applicable to certain of our service offerings, including those in the cybersecurity area, and, with respect to potential international growth, risks associated with operating in foreign jurisdictions, such as compliance with applicable foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that may impose different and, occasionally, conflicting or contradictory requirements, and the economic, legal, and political conditions in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. As we attempt to develop new relationships, clients, capabilities, and service offerings, these efforts could harm our results of operations due to, among other things, a diversion of our focus and resources and actual costs, opportunity costs of pursuing these opportunities in lieu of others and a failure to reach a profitable return on\nPage 40\nour investments in new technologies, capabilities, and businesses, including expenses on research and development investments, and these efforts could ultimately be unsuccessful.\nThe needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and in particular due to complex and rapidly changing technologies. Our success depends upon our ability to identify emerging technological trends; develop technologically advanced, innovative, and cost-effective products and services; and market these products and services to our customers. Our success also depends on our continued access to suppliers of important technologies and components. T\nhe possibility exists that our competitors might develop new capabilities or service offerings that might cause our existing capabilities and service offerings to become obsolete. If we fail in our new capabilities development efforts or our capabilities or services fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors, our ability to procure new contracts could be negatively impacted, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to grow our business by leveraging our operating model to efficiently and effectively deploy our people across our client base is also largely dependent on our ability to maintain our collaborative culture. To the extent that we are unable to maintain our culture for any reason, including our effort to focus on new growth areas, we may be unable to grow our business. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, with the growth of our U.S. and international operations, we provide client services and undertake business development efforts in numerous and disparate geographic locations, both domestically and internationally. Our ability to effectively serve our clients is dependent upon our ability to successfully leverage our operating model across all of these and any future locations, maintain effective management controls over all of our locations to ensure, among other things, compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, and instill our core values in all of our personnel at each of these and any future locations. Any inability to ensure any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance\nPast and future environmental, health, and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances, and human health and safety. These laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost. Violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities.\nVarious U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities. These laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants. The liability under these laws may be joint and several. We have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties. The discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen clean-up obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWhen we perform our services, our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions. We are subject to liability claims by employees, customers and third parties as a result of such exposures. In addition, we are subject to fines, penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws. A claim, if not covered or only partially covered by insurance, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nHealth, safety, and environmental laws and regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes thereto could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could, for example, relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment, which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and, in turn, could negatively impact our revenue. Changes in the environmental laws and regulations, remediation obligations, enforcement actions, stricter interpretations of existing requirements, future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate. Failure to comply with any environmental, health, or safety laws or regulations, whether actual\nPage 41\nor alleged, exposes us to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments, which requires us or our clients to obtain, and to comply with, federal, state and local government permits and approvals. These permits or approvals are subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. Failure to obtain or comply with, or the loss or modification of, the conditions of permits or approvals subjects us to the risk of penalties or other liabilities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and result of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with federal, state, local or foreign governmental requirements, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. For example, our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders which requires compliance with both export regulatory laws and International Trafficking in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”). Although we have policies and procedures to comply with U.S. and foreign international trade laws, the violation of such laws could subject the Company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges or debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts, and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances; strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Climate Change\nClimate change and related environmental issues could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClimate change related events, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, freezing conditions, and other natural disasters, may have a long-term impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation. While we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks regardless of where we conduct our businesses. For example, a catastrophic natural disaster could negatively impact any of our office locations and the locations of our customers. Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business is critical to our operations. Accordingly, a natural disaster has the potential to disrupt our and our customers’ businesses and may cause us to experience work stoppages, project delays, financial losses and additional costs to resume operations, including increased insurance costs or loss of cover, legal liability and reputational losses.\nFurther, the risks caused by climate change span across the full spectrum of the industry sectors we serve. Our services and solutions span water, energy, the natural and built environment, transportation, national security, cyber and aerospace. The direct physical risks that climate change poses to infrastructure through chronic environmental changes, such as rising sea levels and temperatures, and acute events, such as hurricanes, droughts and wildfires, is common to each of these sectors. Infrastructure owners could face increased costs to maintain their assets, which could result in reduced profitability and fewer resources for strategic investment. These types of physical risks could in turn lead to transitional risks (i.e., the degree to which society responds to the threat of climate change), such as market and technology shifts, including decreased demand for our services and solutions, reputational risks, such as how our values and practices\nPage 42\nregarding a low carbon transition are viewed by external and internal stakeholders, and policy and legal risks, such as the extent to which low carbon transitions are driven by the governments in which we operate around the globe, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nWe may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change.\nGrowing public concern about climate change has resulted in the increased focus of local, state, regional, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues. Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both in the United States and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. The Biden Administration has made climate change and the limitation of GHG emissions one of its initial and primary objectives. For example, in January 2021, President Biden signed a number of executive orders with respect to GHGs, including one recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement, pursuant to which nearly 200 nations have committed to reduce global emissions. Additionally, President Biden announced the United States’ Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement at his summit on climate change on April 22, 2021. The target aims to reduce U.S. emissions by 50-52% compared to a 2005 baseline by 2030.\nSeveral states and geographic regions in the United States have also adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs. Additional legislation or regulation by these states and regions, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and/or any international agreements to which the United States may become a party, that control or limit GHG emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients and have other impacts on our clients, including those who are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels, emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases through the mining, manufacture, utilization or production of materials or goods. In addition, the recent announcement of the Methane Reduction Pledge as part of the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed at COP26 could also have implications for some of our clients’ businesses.. Such policy changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, climate legislation  across all geographies poses a similar risk to us and our clients as we operate globally.  However, policy changes and climate legislation could also increase the overall demand for our services as our clients and partners work to comply with such policies, such as by decarbonizing their industries, transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources and developing integrated and sustainable solutions, which could have a positive impact on our business. We cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers.\nWe may be unable to achieve our climate commitments and targets.\nAt Jacobs, we have committed to help solve the climate crisis by setting ambitious climate commitments and targets, including our goal to be carbon negative for our operations and business travel. However, achievement of our climate commitments and targets, including our carbon negative goal, is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to execute our operational strategies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected timeframes; the availability and cost of alternative fuels, global electrical charging infrastructure, off-site renewable energy and other materials and components; unforeseen design, operational and technological difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments, including the ability to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration and/or other related processes; compliance with, and changes or additions to, global and regional regulations, taxes, charges, mandates or requirements relating to GHG emissions, carbon costs or climate-related goals; labor-related regulations and requirements that restrict or prohibit our ability to impose requirements on third party contractors; adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions; the actions of competitors and competitive pressures; an acquisition of or merger with another company that has not adopted similar carbon negative goals or whose progress towards reaching its carbon negative\ngoals is not as advanced as ours; and the pace of regional and global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our operational strategies and achieve our climate commitments and targets.\nWhile our climate commitments and targets are ambitious, we believe that they are realistic and achievable. We have also developed a roadmap for implementation of our carbon reduction goals and our global emissions reduction trajectory suggests that we are on the pathway to meet our targets. However, we also recognize that some of our emission reductions over the past two years may have been primarily the result of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Our roadmap recognizes this and we are putting measures in place now to ensure that we remain on that same trajectory however we cannot guarantee that such measures will be successful. Failure to achieve our climate commitments and targets could damage our reputation and our customer and other stakeholder relationships. Further, investors have recently increased their focus on environmental, social and governance matters, including practices related to GHGs and climate change. An increasing percentage of the investment community considers sustainability factors in making investment decisions, and\nPage 43\nan increasing number of entities are considering sustainability factors in awarding business. If we are unable to meet our climate commitments and targets and appropriately address sustainability enhancement, we may lose investors, customers, or partners, our stock price may be negatively impacted, our reputation may be negatively affected, and it may be more difficult for us to compete effectively, all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as on the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe rely on cash provided by operations and liquidity under our credit facilities to fund our business. Negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could adversely affect our cost of borrowing and our business.\nAlthough we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations, at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions. We are currently a borrower under several credit facilities. These facilities all contain customary covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to incur certain liens and indebtedness. We are also subject to certain financial covenants, including maintenance of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. A breach of any covenant or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under one or more of our credit facilities and limit our ability to do further borrowing. Instability in the credit markets in the U.S. or abroad could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. This situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds, refinance our existing indebtedness, enter into agreements for new indebtedness, or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit, which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business. In addition, market conditions could negatively impact our clients’ ability to fund their projects and, therefore, utilize our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us. We also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors, suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets. If those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients, we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients. These circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients, which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our customers, suppliers and subcontractors depend on access to commercial financing and capital markets to fund their operations. Disruptions of the credit or capital markets could adversely affect our clients’ ability to finance projects and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, project delays and payment delays or defaults by our clients. In addition, clients may be unable to fund new projects, may choose to make fewer capital expenditures or otherwise slow their spending on our services or to seek contract terms more favorable to them. Our government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing projects or that cause them to exercise their right to terminate our contracts with little or no prior notice. In addition, any financial difficulties suffered by our subcontractors or suppliers could increase our cost or adversely impact project schedules. These disruptions could materially impact our backlog and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are, therefore, subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices after we have already committed resources to their projects. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures due to, among other reasons, our clients’ unwillingness to pay for alleged poor performance or to preserve their own working capital. If one or more clients delays in paying or fails to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, our cash balances and short-term investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in North America, Europe, South America, Australia and Asia. Some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance. Although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership, or have been seized by their governments, there is\nPage 44\na risk that such events may occur in the future. If any such events were to occur, we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash, which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMaintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts.\nIn line with industry practice, we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds or letters of credit to our customers. These instruments indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract. If a bond or a letter of credit is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond or letter of credit, we cannot pursue that project. Historically, we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but, as is typically the case, the issuance of a bond is at the surety’s sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the Company's credit-worthiness. Because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost. There can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. In addition, future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our existing credit facilities. Our inability to obtain adequate bonding and, as a result, to bid on new contracts that require such bonding or letter of credit could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or fall below the expectations of securities analysts, which could have a material adverse impact on the price of our common stock. Fluctuations are caused by a number of factors, including:\n•\nLegal proceedings, disputes and/or government investigations;\n•\nFluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers;\n•\nThe number and significance of projects executed during a quarter;\n•\nUnanticipated changes in contract performance, particularly with contracts that have funding limits;\n•\nThe timing of resolving change orders, requests for equitable adjustments, and other contract adjustments;\n•\nDelays incurred in connection with a project;\n•\nChanges in prices of commodities or other supplies;\n•\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n•\nWeather conditions that delay work at project sites;\n•\nThe timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives;\n•\nThe decision by the Board of Directors to begin or cease paying a dividend, and the expectation that if the Company pays dividends, it would declare dividends at the same or higher levels in the future;\n•\nNatural disasters or other crises;\n•\nStaff levels and utilization rates;\n•\nChanges in prices of services offered by our competitors; and\n•\nGeneral economic and political conditions.\nThere can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program in fiscal 2017 under which we have paid, and intend to continue paying, regular quarterly dividends. The declaration, amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and applicable agreements. Our ability to pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions,\nPage 45\nincluding acquisitions, debt service requirements, results of operations, financial condition and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or our dividend program could have a material negative effect on our stock price.\nIn the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make, we could dilute share ownership, and if we receive stock in connection with a divestiture, the value of stock is subject to fluctuation.\nOne method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. If we issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders’ individual ownership percentages in the Company.\nIn addition, if we receive stock or other equity securities in connection with a sale or divestiture of a business, the value of such stock will fluctuate and/or be subject to trading restrictions. Stock price changes may result from, among other things, changes in the business, operations or prospects of the issuer prior to or following the transaction, litigation or regulatory considerations, general business, market, industry or economic conditions, the ability to sell all or a portion of the stock based on current market conditions, and other factors both within and beyond the control of the Company. In addition, if the stock received is valued in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the value of such stock will also fluctuate based on foreign currency rates.\nDelaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control.\nWe are a Delaware corporation. Certain anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us. In addition, certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover. For example:\n•\nOnly our Board of Directors can fill vacancies on the board;\n•\nThere are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and\n•\nOur Board of Directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares.\nThese types of provisions, as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. Accordingly, shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares."

    "text": "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nPage 48\nIn order to better understand the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, a reader of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\nThe consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing long-term professional services, engineering and construction-type contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities. Although our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2-\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Accounting for Contracts\nEngineering, Procurement & Construction Contracts and Service Contracts\nOn September 29, 2018, the Company adopted ASC Topic 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\nincluding the subsequent ASUs that amended and clarified the related guidance. The Company recognizes engineering, procurement, and construction contract revenue over time, as performance obligations are satisfied, due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer. Upon adoption of ASC Topic 606, contracts which include engineering, procurement and construction services are generally accounted for as a single deliverable (a single performance obligation) and are no longer segmented between types of services. In some instances, the Company’s services associated with a construction activity are limited only to specific tasks such as customer support, consulting or supervisory services. In these instances, the services are typically identified as separate performance obligations.\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the percentage-of-completion method, based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract costs. Estimated contract costs include the Company’s latest estimates using judgments with respect to labor hours and costs, materials, and subcontractor costs. The percentage-of-completion method (an input method) is the most representative depiction of the Company’s performance because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer. Subcontractor materials, labor and equipment and, in certain cases, customer-furnished materials and labor and equipment are included in revenue and cost of revenue when management believes that the company is acting as a principal rather than as an agent (e.g., the company integrates the materials, labor and equipment into the deliverables promised to the customer or is otherwise primarily responsible for fulfillment and acceptability of the materials, labor and/or equipment). The Company recognizes revenue, but not profit, on certain uninstalled materials that are not specifically produced, fabricated, or constructed for a project. Under the typical payment terms of our engineering, procurement and construction contracts, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms at periodic intervals (e.g., biweekly or monthly) and customer payments on are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing, depending on the contract.\nFor service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time using the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method. Service contracts that include multiple performance obligations are segmented between types of services. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each distinct service in the contract. In some instances where the Company is standing ready to provide services, the Company recognizes revenue ratably over the service period. Under the typical payment terms of our service contracts, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, and customer payments are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing, depending on the contract.\nDirect costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts, including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in providing the services required by the related projects. The level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors, including the amount of pass-through costs we incur during a period. On those projects where we are acting as principal for subcontract labor or third-party materials and equipment, we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs (and we refer to such costs as “pass-through costs”).\nVariable Consideration\nPage 49\nThe nature of the Company’s contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims and unpriced change orders; awards and incentive fees; and liquidated damages and penalties. The Company recognizes revenue for variable consideration when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Company estimates the amount of revenue to be recognized on variable consideration using the expected value (i.e., the sum of a probability-weighted amount) or the most likely amount method, whichever is expected to better predict the amount. If the requirements for recognizing revenue for claims or unapproved change orders are met, revenue is recorded only when the costs associated with the claims or unapproved change orders have been incurred and only up to the amount of cost incurred.\nPractical Expedient\nIf the Company has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the Company’s performance completed to date (a service contract in which the company bills a fixed amount for each hour of service provided), the Company recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice for services performed.\nJoint Ventures and VIEs\nAs is common to the industry, we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures. Although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients, the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners, or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures. Many of these joint ventures are formed for a specific project. The assets of our joint ventures generally consist almost entirely of cash and receivables (representing amounts due from clients), and the liabilities of our joint ventures generally consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners (for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts) and other subcontractors. In general, at any given time, the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients. Very few of our joint ventures have employees or third-party debt or credit facilities. The debt held by the joint ventures is non-recourse to the general credit of Jacobs.\nOur unconsolidated joint ventures (including equity method investments) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable, and impairment losses are recognized for such investments if there is a decline in fair value below carrying value that is considered to be other-than-temporary.\nMany of the joint ventures are deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIE”) because they lack sufficient equity to finance the activities of the joint venture. The Company uses a qualitative approach to determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, which considers factors that indicate a party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the joint venture’s economic performance. These factors include the composition of the governing board, how board decisions are approved, the powers granted to the operational manager(s) and partner that holds that position(s), and to a certain extent, the partner’s economic interest in the joint venture. The Company analyzes each joint venture initially to determine if it should be consolidated or unconsolidated.\n•\nConsolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, or holds the majority of voting interests of a non-VIE (and no significant participative rights are available to the other partners).\n•\nUnconsolidated if the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, or does not hold the majority of voting interest of a non-VIE.\nShare-Based Payments\nWe measure the value of services received from employees and directors in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The computed value is recognized as a non-cash cost on a straight-line basis over the period the individual provides services, which is typically the vesting period of the award with the exception of the value of awards containing an internal performance measure, such as EPS growth and ROIC, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period subject to the probability of meeting the performance requirements and adjusted for the number of shares expected to be earned.\nAccounting for Pension Plans\nThe accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities. These assumptions include discount rates, investment returns\nPage 50\nand projected salary increases, among others. The actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in Note 13-\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe expected rates of return on plan assets ranged from 1.8% to 7% for fiscal 2021 and range from 2% to 7% fiscal 2022. We believe the range of rates selected for fiscal 2022 reflects the long-term returns expected on the plans’ assets, considering recent market conditions, projected rates of inflation, the diversification of the plans’ assets, and the expected real rates of market returns. The discount rates used to compute plan liabilities ranged from 0.4% to 6.6% in fiscal 2021 and range of 0.6% to 6.6% in fiscal 2022. These assumptions represent the Company’s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled.\nChanges in the actuarial assumptions often have a material effect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities, and the associated pension expense. For example, if the discount rate used to value the net pension benefit obligation (“PBO”) at October 1, 2021 was higher by 0.5%, the PBO would have been lower at that date by approximately\n$229.4 million for non-U.S. plans, and by approximately $20.5 million f\nor U.S. plans. If the expected return on plan assets was higher by 1.0%, the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2021 would be lower by approximately\n$21.2 million for non-U.S. plans, and by approximately $3.4 million for U.S. plans. Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance (i.e., actuarial gains and losses) that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensi\nve income (loss) and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used.\nPage 51\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nIn connection with the PA Consulting investment, the Company recorded redeemable noncontrolling interests, representing the interest holders' 35% equity interest in the form of preferred and common shares of PA Consulting. The preferred shares are entitled to a cumulative annual compounding 12% dividend based on the outstanding preferred share subscription price. These interest holders have certain option rights to put the preferred and common share interests back to the Company at a value based on the fair value of PA Consulting (the redemption values). Additionally, the Company has an option to call the interests for certain individual shareholders in certain circumstances. Because the interests are redeemable at the option of the holders and not solely within the control of the Company, the Company classified the interests in redeemable noncontrolling interests within its Consolidated Balance Sheet at their redemption values. The optional redemption features may become exercisable no earlier than five years from the March 2, 2021 closing date, or upon the occurrence of certain other events.\nThe Company has deemed these interests probable of becoming redeemable in the future and requiring their measurement at the greater of (i) the redemption amount that would be paid if settlement occurred at the balance sheet date, or (ii) the historical value resulting from the original acquisition date fair value plus the impact of any earnings or loss attribution amounts, including dividends.\nThe fair value of the the PA Consulting redeemable noncontrolling interests is determined using an income and market approach.\nFurther, any excess in redemption amounts over the historical values of the interests is recognized as an increase to redeemable noncontrolling interests and an offsetting decrease in consolidated retained earnings. Additionally, particular to the preference share and in certain circumstances the ordinary share components of redeemable noncontrolling interests, such decrease in consolidated retained earnings is also reflected as a corresponding downward adjustment to net earnings attributable to Jacobs for purposes of the calculation of consolidated earnings per share attributable to common shareholders.\nContractual Guarantees, Litigation, Investigations, and Insurance\nIn the normal course of business, we make contractual commitments, some of which are supported by separate guarantees; and on occasion we are a party in a litigation or arbitration proceeding. The litigation in which we are involved primarily includes personal injury claims, professional liability claims, and breach of contract claims. Where we provide a separate guarantee, it is strictly in support of the underlying contractual commitment. Guarantees take various forms including surety bonds required by law, or standby letters of credit (\"LOC\") (also referred to as “bank guarantees”) or corporate guarantees given to induce a party to enter into a contract with a subsidiary. Standby LOCs are also used as security for advance payments or in various other transactions. The guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from an arbitrary date to completion of our work (e.g., engineering only) to completion of the overall project. We record in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees, litigation and insurance claims. Guarantees are accounted for in accordance with ASC 460-10,\nGuarantees\n, at fair value at the inception of the guarantee.\nWe maintain insurance coverage for most insurable aspects of our business and operations. Our insurance programs have varying coverage limits depending upon the type of insurance, and include certain conditions and exclusions which insurance companies may raise in response to any claim that the Company brings. We have also elected to retain a portion of losses and liabilities that occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under our insurance programs. As a result, we may be subject to a future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured. We intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of the contracts which the Company enters with its clients. Our insurers are also subject to business risk and, as a result, one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise.\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheets include amounts representing our probable estimated liability relating to such claims, guarantees, litigation, audits, and investigations. Our estimates of probable liabilities require us to make assumptions related to potential losses regarding our determination of amounts considered probable and estimable. We perform an analysis to determine the level of reserves to establish for insurance-related claims that are known and have been asserted against us, as well as for insurance-related claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis, but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates. We include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations. Insurance recoveries are recorded as assets if recovery is probable and estimated liabilities are not reduced by expected insurance recoveries.\nPage 52\nThe Company believes, after consultation with counsel, that such guarantees, litigation, U.S. government contract-related audits, investigations and claims, and income tax audits and investigations should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements, beyond amounts currently accrued.\nTesting Goodwill for Possible Impairment\nThe goodwill carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheets is tested annually for possible impairment, and on an interim basis if indicators of possible impairment exist. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is assigned to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure. In performing the annual impairment test, we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units at the beginning of the fourth quarter of its fiscal year.\nWe evaluate impairment of goodwill either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or by performing a quantitative assessment. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and circumstances affecting the reporting unit. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and after considering the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would perform a quantitative fair value test.\nU.S. GAAP does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units. Any valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others.\nWe use income and market approaches to test our goodwill for possible impairment which requires us to make estimates and judgments. Under the income approach, fair value is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units. The Company’s discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) for a peer group of companies representative of the Company’s respective reporting units. Under the market approach, the fair values of our reporting units are determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to our reporting units; the fair values are estimated based on the valuation multiples of the invested capital associated with the guideline companies. In assessing whether there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired, we utilize the results of both valuation techniques and consider the range of fair values indicated.\nIt is possible that changes in market conditions, economy, facts and circumstances, judgments and assumptions used in estimating the fair value could change, resulting in possible impairment of goodwill in the future. The fair values resulting from the valuation techniques used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties.\nFor the 2021 fiscal year, we have determined that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values for the Consolidated Balance Sheets presented and any analysis beyond the qualitative level was not considered necessary.\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended October 1, 2021, October 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019\nPage 53\n(In thousands, except per share information)\n2021 Overview\nCOVID-19 Pandemic.\nThere are many risks and uncertainties regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, including the anticipated duration of the pandemic and the extent of local and worldwide social, political, and economic disruption it may cause. The Company’s operations for fiscal 2021 were adversely impacted by COVID-19. While certain business units of Critical Mission Solutions, People & Places Solutions and PA Consulting have experienced, and may continue to experience, an increase in demand for certain of their services regarding new projects that may arise in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is still expected that COVID-19 is likely to continue to have an adverse impact on each of Critical Missions Solutions, People & Places Solutions and PA Consulting in fiscal 2022, although to a lesser degree than what was seen in 2021 or 2020.\nPage 54\nPlease refer to Item 1A -\nRisk Factors\n, for a discussion of risks and uncertainties related to COVID-19, including the potential impacts on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNet earnings attributable to the Company from continuing operations for fiscal 2021 were $467.0 million (or $3.12 per diluted share), an increase of $113.2 million, or 32.0%, from $353.9 million (or $2.67 per diluted share) for the prior year. Overall favorable operating profit improvements during the current year compared to the last year benefited from our PA Consulting and Buffalo Group investing activities in the current year as well as operating profit results in our legacy businesses. These favorable items were offset by the one-time impact of $261.4 million in relation to certain transaction proceeds amounts for the PA investment required to be treated as post-completion compensation expense due to continuing employment requirements associated with employees of PA receiving transaction proceeds in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles. This required treatment had no impact on the total purchase consideration for this investment. Additionally, included in the Company's reported results in miscellaneous income (expense), net from continuing operations for the year ended October 1, 2021 was $34.7 million in pre-tax net gains associated with our investment in Worley stock (net of Worley stock dividend), which was sold during the fourth quarter fiscal 2021, and certain foreign currency revaluations relating to the ECR sale, as well as pre-tax realized gains associated with our investment in C3.ai, Inc. (\"C3\") of $49.6 million, which was sold during fiscal 2021, as further discussed Note 8-\nJoint Ventures, VIEs and Other Investments.\nFurther, $38.6 million in offsetting pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment charges were recorded for our AWE Management Ltd (\"AWE\") investment in fiscal 2021. In comparison, miscellaneous income (expense), net for the corresponding 2020 period included pre-tax earnings of $330.2 million in Restructuring and other charges and transaction costs associated in part with the Company's fourth quarter fiscal 2020 transformation initiatives relating to real estate and other staffing programs which are discussed in Note 17-\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nand $74.5 million in pre-tax fair value losses associated with our investment in Worley stock (net of Worley stock dividend) and certain foreign currency revaluations relating to the ECR sale. Income tax expense for continuing operations for fiscal 2021 was $274.8 million, an increase of $219.5 million, or 396.7%, from $55.3 million in the prior year. Key drivers for this year-over-year increase include $48.7 million related to nondeductible compensation expense relating to the PA Consulting acquisition, $25.6 million related to tax law changes enacted in the United Kingdom, and the current year change in valuation allowance of $38.9 million as compared to income tax benefits during fiscal 2020 of $11.3 million for the release of uncertain tax positions, $6.8 million related to income tax rate changes, the prior year change in valuation allowance of $16.9 million, with the remaining increase related mainly to higher levels of pre-tax income in 2021.\nNet earnings attributable to Jacobs from discontinued operations for fiscal 2021 were $10.0 million (or $0.08 per diluted share), a decrease of $128.0 million, or 92.8%, from $138.0 million (or $1.04 per diluted share) for the prior year. Included in net earnings attributable to the Company from discontinued operations for the current year was the pre-tax gain amount of $15.6 million associated with the final working capital settlement with Worley in connection with the ECR sale during the current year. Also, the comparative 2020 year to date period included the settlement of the Nui Phao (\"NPMC\") legal matter that was reimbursed by insurance, the recognition of the deferred gain for the delayed conveyance of the international entities and for the delivery of the ECR IT assets and adjustments for working capital and certain other items in connection with the ECR sale. For further discussion, see Note 16 -\nSale of Energy, Chemicals and Resources (\"ECR\") Business\n.\nOn March 2, 2021, Jacobs completed the strategic investment of a 65% interest in PA Consulting. For further discussion, see Note 14-\nPA Consulting Business Combination\n.\nOn November 24, 2020, Jacobs completed the acquisition of Buffalo Group. For further discussion, see Note 15-\nOther Business Combinations.\nBacklog at October 1, 2021 was $26.6 billion, up $2.8 billion, from $23.8 billion for the prior year. New prospects and new sales remain strong and the Company continues to have a positive outlook for many of the industry groups and sectors in which our clients operate.\nSubsequent to October 1, 2021, the Company has entered into the planning stages for identifying certain additional leased space that it intends to abandon or market for sublease and expects to record associated impairment charges in fiscal 2022 upon finalization of these plans. Potential charges for these plans are expected to approximate up to $70 million.\nResults of Operations\nPage 55\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nRevenues for the year ended October 1, 2021 were $14.09 billion, an increase of $525.7 million, or 3.9%, from $13.57 billion for the prior year. The increase in revenues was due partly to fiscal 2021 incremental revenues from the PA Consulting investment completed in March 2021, the Buffalo Group business acquisition completed in November 2020 and the March 2020 John Wood Group nuclear business acquisition. In addition, reve\nnue growth benefited from favorable foreign currency translation of\n$238.6 million for the year ended October 1, 2021, in our international businesses, as compared to unfavorable impacts of $30.8 million\nfor the corresponding period last year. The current year benefits were partially offset by market conditions and certain contract wind downs in our U.S. businesses and\nthe extra week of activity in fiscal 2020\n.\nPass-through costs included in revenues for the year ended October 1, 2021 were $2.38 billion, in comparison to $2.61 billion in the prior year. In general, pass-through costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities. Pass-through costs are generally incurred at specific points during the life cycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects. However, because we have hundreds of projects that start at various times within a fiscal year, the effect of pass-through costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business.\nGross profit for the year ended October 1, 2021 was $3.04 billion, up $457.1 million, or 17.7%, from $2.59 billion for the prior year. Our gross profit margins were 21.6% and 19.1% for the years ended October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020, respectively. The increase in our gross profit and gross profit margins were mainly attributable to the recent business acquisition\ns mentioned along with favorable foreign currency translation impacts in our international businesses partially offset by market conditions and certain contract wind downs in our U.S. businesses and\nthe extra week of activity in fiscal 2020\nas noted above.\nSee\nSegment Financial Information\ndiscussion for further information on the Company’s results of operations at the operating segment level.\nSelling, general & administrative expenses for the year ended October 1, 2021 were $2.36 billion,\nan increase\nof $305.0 million, or 14.9%, from $2.05 billion for the prior year. The current year's results were impacted by incremental SG&A expenses from the recent business acquisitions mentioned above and higher personnel-related costs, partly offset by lower other operational overhead costs and the extra week of activity in fiscal 2020. Additionally, restructuring and other charges for fiscal 2021 were mainly attributable to post-completion compensation expense of $261 million in connection with the investment in PA Consulting, while fiscal 2020 included $325.1 million of restructuring and other charges and transaction costs associated in part with the Company's fourth quarter fiscal 2020 transformation initiatives relating to real estate and other staffing programs. Incremental SG&A expenses from the above-mentioned business acquisitions have been offset in part b\ny continued reductions in personnel-related and other overhead costs resulting from our ongoing cost reduction programs. Unfavorable impacts on SG&A expenses from foreign exchange were\n$75.9 million\nfor the year ended October 1, 2021 as compared to nominal favorable impacts for the corresponding period last year.\nNet interest expense for the year ended October 1, 2021 was $69.2 million, an increase of $11.7 million from $57.5 million for the prior year. The increase in net interest expense year over year is primarily due to the higher levels of debt outstanding in the current year as a result of the PA acquisition, partially offset by lower interest rates.\nMiscellaneous income (expense), net for the year ended October 1, 2021 was $76.7 million, an increase of $114.0 million as compared to $(37.3) million in expense for the prior year. The increase from the prior year was due primarily to $34.7 million in pre-tax net gains associated with changes in the fair value of our investment in Worley stock (net of Worley stock dividend) (which was sold in fourth quarter fiscal 2021) and certain foreign currency revaluations relating to the ECR sale in the current year, compared to pre-tax net losses of $74.5 million in the prior year. Also included in miscellaneous (expense) income during the current year are pre-tax realized gains of $49.6 million related to holdings of our C3 shares sold during the period, as further discussed in Note 11 - Joint Ventures, VIEs and Other Investments. These favorable impacts for fiscal 2021 were partially offset by other-than-temporary impairment charges on our investment in AWE in the amount of $38.6 million.\nPage 56\nThe following table reconciles total income tax expense on continuing operations using the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the consolidated income tax expense on continuing operations shown in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the years ended October 1, 2021, October 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019 (dollars in thousands):\nThe Company’s consolidated effective income tax rate for the year ended October 1, 2021 increased to 39.5% from 12.5% for fiscal 2020. Key drivers for this year-over-year increase in the effective tax rate include impacts from $261 million in nondeductible compensation relating to the PA investment post-completion compensation expense, $25.6 million related to tax law changes enacted in the United Kingdom, and the current year change in valuation allowance of $38.9 million as compared to income tax benefits during fiscal 2020 of $11.3 million for the release of uncertain tax positions, $6.8 million related to income tax rate changes, the prior year change in valuation allowance of $16.9 million, with the remaining increase related mainly to higher levels of pre-tax income in 2021.\nPage 57\nSegment Financial Information\nThe following tables present total revenues and segment operating profit for each reportable segment (in thousands) and includes a reconciliation of segment operating profit to total U.S. GAAP operating profit by including certain corporate-level expenses and expenses relating to the restructuring other charges (as defined in Note 17-\nRestructuring and Other Charges)\nand transaction costs (in thousands).\n(1)\nIncludes $19.5 million, net, in charges related to a legal settlement for the year ended October 1, 2021 and $25.0 million in charges associated with a certain project for the year ended September 27, 2019.\n(2)\nOther corporate expenses include intangibles amortization of\n$149.8 million\n, $90.6 million and $79.1 million for the years ended October 1, 2021\n,\nOctober 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019, respectively. Also includes costs that were previously allocated to the ECR segment prior to discontinued operations presentation in connection with the ECR sale in the approximate amount of $14.8 million for the year ended September 27, 2019.\n(3)\nIncluded in the year ended October 1, 2021 is $297.8 million of costs incurred in connection with the investment in PA Consulting, in part classified as compensation costs.\n(4)\nThe years ended October 1, 2021, October 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019 include $34.7 million\n, $(74.3) million and $(64.8) million in fair value adjustments related to our investment in Worley stock (net of Worley stock div\nidends) (sold during the current year) and certain foreign currency r\nevaluations relating to ECR sale proceeds, respectively and revenues under the Company's TSA with Worley of $0.2 million, $15.8 million\nand $35.4 million, respectively. The year ended October 1, 2021 includes\n$38.6 million\nrelated to impairment of our AWE Management Ltd. investment and\n$49.6 million\nin fair value adjustments related to our investment in C3 stock. Lastly, includes gain on settlement of the CH2M retiree medical plans of $35.0 million for the year ended September 27, 2019.\nPage 58\nIn evaluating the Company’s performance by operating segment, the CODM reviews various metrics and statistical data for each Line Of Business (\"LOB\") and PA Consulting, but focuses primarily on revenues and operating profit. As discussed above, segment operating profit includes not only local SG&A expenses but the SG&A expenses of the Company’s support groups that have been allocated to the segments. In addition, the Company attributes each segment's specific incentive compensation plan costs to the segments. The revenues of the People & Places Solutions LOB are more affected by pass-through revenues than the Critical Mission Solutions LOB or the PA Consulting segment. The methods for recognizing revenue, incentive fees, project losses and change orders are consistent among the segments.\nCritical Mission Solutions\nCritical Mission Solutions (CMS) segment revenues for the year ended October 1, 2021 were $5.09 billion, up $121.1 million, or 2.4%, from $4.97 billion for the prior year. Our increase in revenue was primarily attributable to incremental revenue from the Buffalo Group and John Wood Group nuclear business acquisitions. There was also comparable revenue growth from most elements of our legacy portfolio, driven by increased spending by customers in the U.S. government business sector and our legacy international clients, mitigated by several large contracts winding down in the U.S. and one less week of activity as compared to fiscal year end 2020. Impacts on revenues from favorable foreign currency translation were approximately $61.8 million for the year ended October 1, 2021, compared to $4.5 million in unfavorable impacts in the corresponding prior year.\nOperating profit for the segment was $447.2 million for the year ended October 1, 2021, up $75.1 million, or 20.2%, from $372.1 million for the prior year. The increases from the prior year were primarily attributable to incremental operating profit from the Buffalo Group and John Wood Group nuclear business acquisitions, and the continued growth in profits from our U.S. governmental business sector and our legacy international business. Impacts on operating profit from favorable forei\ngn currency translation were approximatel\ny $9.7 million\nfor t\nhe year ended October 1, 2021, compared to $0.4 million in unfavorable impacts in the corresponding prior year.\nPeople & Places Solutions\nRevenues for the People & Places Solutions (P&PS) segment for the year ended October 1, 2021 were $8.38 billion, down $222.8 million, or 2.6%, from $8.60 billion for the prior year. The decrease in revenue was driven by softer market conditions in our advanced facilities business and one less week of activity during fiscal year ended October 1, 2021, as compared to the prior year. These items were partially offset by $176.8 million in favorable foreign currency translation in our international business for the year ended October 1, 2021, compared to $26.2 million in unfavorable impacts in the corresponding prior year.\nOperating profit for the segment for the year ended October 1, 2021 was $780.4 million, an increase of $39.7 million, or 5.4%, from $740.7 million for the comparative period in 2020. The year-over-year increase is primarily related to lower spend on travel, discretionary operating expenditures and other operating expenditures and real estate transformation initiatives enacted in fiscal year 2020. Impacts on operating profit from favorable foreign currency translation were approximately $30.9 million for the year ended October 1, 2021, compared to $6.1 million in unfavorable impacts in the corresponding prior year. In addition, these were partially offset by $19.5 million in net charges related to a legal settlement for the year ended October 1, 2021.\nPage 59\nPA Consulting\nRevenues and operating profit for the PA Consulting segment for the year ended October 1, 2021 were $627.4 million and $151.1 million, respectively. There were no comparable periods in the prior year, given the transaction closed on March 2, 2021.\nOther Corporate Expenses\nOther corporate expenses were $340.1 million, $249.4 million and $264.4 million for the years ended October 1, 2021, October 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019, respectively. The increase from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 was due primarily to higher intangible amortization expense from the PA Consulting investment and the Buffalo Group and John Wood Group nuclear business acquisitions, as well as impacts from Company benefit program enhancements. These increases were partly offset by employee related and other cost reductions across the Company's corporate functions.\nIncluded in other corporate expenses in the above table are costs and expenses that relate to general corporate activities as well as corporate-managed benefit and insurance programs. Such costs and expenses include: (i) those elements of SG&A expenses relating to the business as a whole; (ii) those elements of our incentive compensation plans relating to corporate personnel whose other compensation costs are not allocated to the LOBs; (iii) the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations; (iv) the quarterly variances between the Company’s actual costs of certain of its self-insured integrated risk and employee benefit programs and amounts charged to the LOBs; and (v) certain adjustments relating to costs associated with the Company’s international defined benefit pension plans. In addition, other corporate expenses may also include from time to time certain adjustments to contract margins (both positive and negative) associated with projects, as well as other items, where it has been determined that such adjustments are not indicative of the performance of the related LOB.\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nFor discussion regarding restructuring and other charges, see Note 17-\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBacklog Information\nWe include in backlog the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us. Our policy with respect to Operations & Maintenance (\"O&M\") contracts, however, is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year, regardless of the remaining life of the contract. For national government programs (other than national government O&M contracts, which are subject to the same policy applicable to all other O&M contracts), our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award, whether funded or unfunded, excluding option periods. Because of variations in the nature, size, expected duration, funding commitments and the scope of services required by our contracts, the timing of when backlog will be recognized as revenues can vary greatly between individual contracts.\nConsistent with industry practice, substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client, including our U.S. government work. While management uses all information available to it to determine backlog, at any given time our backlog is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein. Backlog is not necessarily an indicator of future revenues.\nBecause certain contracts (e.g., contracts relating to large Engineering, Procurement & Construction (\"EPC\") projects as well as national government programs) can cause large increases to backlog in the fiscal period in which we recognize the award, and because many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over several fiscal quarters (and sometimes over fiscal years), we evaluate our backlog generally on a year-over-year basis, but also on a sequential, quarter-over-quarter basis, where appropriate.\nPage 60\nPlease refer to Item 1A-\nRisk Factors\n, above, for a discussion of other factors that may cause backlog to ultimately convert into revenues at different amounts.\nThe following table summarizes our backlog for the years ended October 1, 2021, October 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019 (in millions):\nThe increase in backlog in Critical Mission Solutions for the years presented was primarily the result of the acquisition of Buffalo Group and conversion of the other robust CMS pipeline.\nThe increase in backlog in People & Places Solutions for the years presented was primarily the result of new awards in the U.K. and U.S. markets.\nBacklog in PA Consulting as of October 1, 2021 was $303.6 million. The PA Consulting transaction closed on March 2, 2021.\nBacklog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the U.S. federal government and its agencies totaled approximately $10.8 billion (or 40.5% of total backlog), $8.5 billion (or 35.7% of total backlog) and $8.8 billion (or 39.1% of total backlog) at October 1, 2021, October 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019, respectively. Most of our federal government contracts require that services be provided beyond one year. In general, these contracts must be funded annually (i.e., the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the U.S. Congress to the procuring agency, and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts).\nWe estimate that approximately $8.50 billion, or 31.9%, of total backlog at October 1, 2021 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year.\nConsolidated backlog differs from the Company’s remaining performance obligations as defined by ASC 606 primarily because of our national government contracts (other than national government O&M contracts). Our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award, whether funded or unfunded excluding the option periods while our remaining performance obligations represent a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. Additionally, the Company includes our proportionate share of backlog related to unconsolidated joint ventures which is not included in our remaining performan\nce obligations.\nFor a discussion on the year ended October 2, 2020 compared to the year ended September 27, 2019, please refer to Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 2, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt October 1, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of $1.01 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.92 billion of available borrowing capacity under our $2.25 billion revolving credit agreement (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"). We finance much of our operations and growth through cash generated by our operations.\nThe amount of cash and cash equivalents at October 1, 2021 represented\nan increase\nof $151.8 million from $862.4 million at October 2, 2020, the reasons for which are described below.\nOur cash flow\nprovided by\noperations of\n$726.3 million\nduring fisc\nal 2021 was comparatively lower\nthan the $806.8 million in cash flow provided by operations for the prior year. This change was due primarily to unfavorable impacts from net cash earnings driven by $261 million in cash used associated with PA Consulting post-completion compensation payments made during the year. These payments were offset in part by overall improved working capital performance, driven by favorability in accounts receivable collection trends partly offset by payments of certain costs deferred from the 2020 COVID assistance programs in the U.S and Europe.\nPage 61\nOur cash used for investing activities for fiscal\n2021 of\n$1.38 billion\nwas\ncomparatively higher than the $429.1 million cash used for investing activities for the prior year. The increase was due primarily to the Buffalo Group acquisition and our investment in PA Consulting during fiscal 2021, partially offset by proceeds received from the Company's disposal of the Worley and C3 investments and the final ECR sale working capital settlement. Investing activities during the prior year were largely associated with the acquisition of John Wood Group's nuclear business of $293.6 million.\nOur cash provided by financing activit\nies for the fiscal year ended 2021 of $799.0 million resulted mainly from\nnet proceeds from borrowings of\n$1.22 billion mainly in connection with the PA Consulting investment,\noffset by cash used for share repurchases of $274.9 million and $156.0 million in dividends to shareholders and non-controlling interests. Cash used for financing activities was $208.3 million in fiscal 2020 and resulted mainly from common stock repurchases of $337.3 million and dividend payments to both shareholders and non-controlling interests of $144.0 million, offset by net proceeds from borrowings of $265.3 million.\nAt October 1, 2021, the Company had approximately $140.4 million in cash and cash equivalents held in the U.S. and $873.9 million held outside of the U.S. (primarily in the U.K., the Eurozone, Australia, India, Japan and the United Arab Emirates), which is used primarily for funding operations in those regions. Other than the tax cost of repatriating funds to the U.S. (see Note 7-\nIncome Taxes\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), there are no material impediments to repatriating these funds to the U.S.\nOn November 19, 2021, Jacobs consummated its previously announced acquisition of BlackLynx (\"BlackLynx\"). Pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), Jacobs acquired all of BlackLynx's outstanding shares of common stock, in a transaction valued at up to $257.5 million, on a cash-free, debt-free basis, including base consideration of $250 million, and a potential earn-out payment of up to $7.5 million. The amount of any earnout payment will depend on BlackLynx achieving certain revenue and gross margin thresholds in calendar year 2022. The purchase price was paid in cash and is subject to customary post-closing adjustments.\nOn March 2, 2021, Jacobs completed the strategic investment of a 65% interest in PA Consulting, a UK-based leading innovation and transformation consulting firm. The total consideration paid by the Company was$1.7 billion, funded through cash on hand, a new term loan and draws on the Company's existing revolver. The remaining 35% interest is held by PA Consulting employees.\nSee Note 14-\nPA Consulting Business Combination\nfor more discussion on the investment and Note 9-\nBorrowings\nfor more discussion on the financing for the transaction.\nOn January 20, 2021, the Company entered into an unsecured delayed draw term loan facility (the “2021 Term Loan Facility”) with a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders. Under the 2021 Term Loan Facility, the Company borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $200.0 million and £650.0 million. The proceeds of the term loans were used primarily to fund the investment in PA Consulting. The 2021 Term Loan Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type that are consistent with those included in the Revolving Credit Facility and the Company’s unsecured term loan facility dated March 25, 2020 (the “2020 Term Loan Facility”). The 2020 Term Loan Facility and the 2021 Term Loan Facility are together referred to as the \"Term Loan Facilities\".\nOn November 24, 2020, a subsidiary of Jacobs completed the acquisition of Buffalo Group, a leader in advanced cyber and intelligence solutions which allows Jacobs to further expand its cyber and intelligence solutions offerings to government clients. The Company paid total consideration o\nf\n$190.1 million, which was comprised of approximately $182.4 million in cash to the former owners of Buffalo Group and contingent consideration of $7.7 million which was expected to be settled in fiscal 2022. See\nNote 15-\nOther Business Combinations\nfor further discussion\n.\nThe Company had\n$263.8 million\nin letters of credit outstanding at October 1, 2021. Of this amount,\n$1.7 million\nwas issued under the Revolving Credit Facility and\n$262.1 million wa\ns issued under separate, committed and uncommitted letter-of-credit facilities.\nWe believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our projected cash requirements for the next twelve months based on the liquidity provided by our cash and cash equivalents on hand, our borrowing capacity and our continuing cash from operations. We further believe that our financial resources and discretionary spend controls will allow us to continue managing the negative impacts of th\ne COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations for the foreseeable future. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on our business and reassess accordingly.\nWe were in compliance with all of our debt covenants at October 1, 2021.\nPage 62\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of October 1, 2021 (in thousands):\n(1)\nDetermined based on borrowings outstanding at the end of fiscal 2021 using the interest rates in effect at that time, considering the effects of interest rate swap agreements, and for our outstanding long-term debt, concluding with the expiration date of the debt facilities as defined below.\n(2)\nAssumes that future contributions will be consistent with amounts contributed in fiscal 2021, allowing for certain growth based on rates of inflation and salary increases, but limited to the amount recorded as of October 1, 2021. Actual contributions will depend on a variety of factors, including amounts required by local laws and regulations, and other funding requirements.\n(3)\nAssumes that future payments will be consistent with amounts paid in fiscal 2021. Due to the non-qualified nature of the plans, and the fact that benefits are based in part on years of service, the payments included in the schedule were limited to the amount recorded as of October 1, 2021.\n(4)\nRepresents those liabilities estimated to be under firm contractual commitments as of October 1, 2021; primarily accounts payable, accrued payroll and accrued dividends.\nEffects of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe effects of inflation and changing prices on our business is discussed in Item 1A-\nRisk Factors\n, and is incorporated herein by reference.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the form of guarantees not reflected in our balance sheet that arise in the normal course of business. However, such off-balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or resources. See Note 18-\nCommitments and Contingencies and Derivative Financial Instruments\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nASU 2017-04,\nSimplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\nis effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. ASU 2017-04 removed the second step of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. An entity will now recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The adoption of ASU 2017-04 had no impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nASU No. 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (\"ASC 326\"): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\nrequires entities to use a current lifetime expected credit loss methodology to measure impairments of certain financial assets. Using this methodology will result in earlier recognition of losses than under the current incurred loss approach, which requires waiting to recognize a loss until it is probable of having been incurred. There are other provisions within the standard that affect how impairments of other financial assets may be recorded and presented, and that expand disclosures. This standard was effective beginning with the first fiscal quarter 2021. The adoption of ASU 326 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nPage 63"

In the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nPlease see the Note 9-\nBorrowings\nin Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on Page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan Facilities and Note Purchase Agreement.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan Facilities and certain other debt obligations are subject to variable rate interest which could be adversely affected by an increase in interest rates. As of October 1, 2021, we had an aggregate of\n$2.4 billion\nin outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facilities. Interest on amounts borrowed under these agreements is subject to adjustment based on the C\nompany’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreements governing the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facilities). Depending on the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facilities bear interest at a Eurocurrency rate plus a margin of between 0.875% and 1.625% or a base rate plus a margin of between 0% and 0.625%. Additionally, if our consolidated leverage ratio exceeds a certain amount, the interest on the Senior Notes may increase by 75 basis points. However, as discussed in Note 18-\nCommitments and Contingencies and Derivative Financial Instrument\ns, we have entered into swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of\n$923.9 million\nt\no convert the variab\nle rate interest based liabilities associated with a corresponding amount of our debt into fixed interest rate liabilities, leaving\n$1.5 billion\nin principal amount subject to variable interest rate risk.\nFor the year ended October 1, 2021, our weighted average floating rate borrowings that are subject to floating rate exposure were approximately\n$1.4 billion\n. If floating interest rates had increased by 1.00%, our interest expense for the year ended October 1, 2021 would have increased by approximately\n$14.3 million\n.\nForeign Currency Risk\nIn situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies.

Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chair and Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nPage 64\nThe Company’s management, with the participation of its Chair and Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act as of October 1, 2021, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the Evaluation Date were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chair and Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAs permitted by SEC guidance for newly acquired businesses, management's assessment of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures did not include an assessment of those disclosure controls and procedures of PA Consulting that are subsumed by internal control over financial reporting. PA Consulting accounted for approximately 19% of total assets as of the Evaluation Date and approximately 4% of total revenues of the Company for the fiscal year ended on the Evaluation Date.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining for the Company adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Management, with the participation of its Chair and Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation Date based on the framework established in\n“Internal Control—Integrated Framework,”\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation Date was effective. As permitted by SEC guidance for newly acquired businesses, management’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting did not include an assessment of internal control over financial reporting of PA Consulting. PA Consulting accounted for approximately 19% of total assets as of the Evaluation Date and approximately 4% of total revenues of the Company for the fiscal year ended on the Evaluation Date.\nThe Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, that audited the Company's consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2021, as stated in their report included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended October 1, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nThe Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed or operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met. The design of the Company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints, and that the benefits of such control systems must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions.\nPage 65"

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nDescription of Business and Basis of Presentation\nDescription of Business\nJacobs is a leading global professional services company that designs and deploys technology-centric solutions to solve many of the world’s most complex challenges. We operate in\nthree\noperating segments: Critical Mission Solutions,  People & Places Solutions and the recent strategic investment in PA Consulting Group Limited (\"PA Consulting\").\nWe provide a broad range of technical, professional and construction services including engineering, design and architectural services; construction and construction management services; operations and maintenance services; and process, scientific and systems consulting services. We provide our services through offices and subsidiaries located primarily in North America, Europe, the Middle East, India, Australia, New Zealand and Asia. We provide our services under cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts, with our fixed-price contracts comprised mainly of professional services arrangements and in some limited cases, construction.\nThe percentage of revenues realized from each of these types of contracts for the fiscal years ended October 1, 2021, October 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019 was as follows:\nBasis of Presentation, Definition of Fiscal Year, and Other Matters\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\") and include the accounts of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates which it controls. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to September 30 (determined on the basis of the number of workdays) and, accordingly, an additional week of activity is added every five-to-six years. Fiscal 2020 included an extra week of activity.\nEffective the beginning of fiscal first quarter 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (\"ASC 842\"), including the subsequent ASU's that amended and clarified the related guidance. The Company adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective approach, and accordingly the new guidance was applied to leases that existed or were entered into after the first day of adoption without adjusting the comparative periods presented. Please refer to Note 10-\nLeases\nfor a discussion of our updated policies and disclosures related to leases.\nEffective the beginning of fiscal first quarter 2019, the Company adopted ASC Topic 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n, including the subsequent ASUs that amended and clarified the related guidance. The Company adopted ASC Topic 606 using the modified retrospective method, and accordingly the new guidance was applied retrospectively to contracts that were not completed or substantially completed as of September 29, 2018 (the date of initial application). Please refer to Note 3-\nRevenue Accounting for Contracts\n.\nOn March 2, 2021, Jacobs completed the strategic investment of a\n65\n% interest in PA Consulting, a UK-based leading innovation and transformation consulting firm. The total consideration paid by the Company was$\n1.7\nbillion, funded through cash on hand, proceeds from a new term loan and draws on the Company's existing revolver. Further, in connection with the transaction, an additional $261 million in investment proceeds had not yet been distributed at the investment date due to continuing employment requirements of associated management owners. Consequently, this amount represented compensation expense incurred related to the investment that was expensed subsequent to the acquisition date, and is reflected in selling, general and administrative expense and cash from operations for the current fiscal year. The remaining 35% interest is held by PA Consulting employees, whose redeemable noncontrolling interests had a fair value of $\n582.4\nmillion on the closing date, including subsequent purchase accounting adjustments. PA Consulting is accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary and as a separate operating segment under U.S. GAAP accounting rules\nSee Note 14-\nPA Consulting Business Combination\nfor more discussion on the investment and Note 9-\nBorrowings\nfor more discussion on the financing for the transaction.\nF-8\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nOn November 24, 2020, a subsidiary of Jacobs completed the acquisition of Buffalo Group, a leader in advanced cyber and intelligence solutions which allows Jacobs to further expand its cyber and intelligence solutions offerings to government clients. The Company paid total consideration o\nf\n$\n190.1\nmillion, which was comprised of approximately $\n182.4\nmillion in cash to the former owners of Buffalo Group and contingent consideration of $\n7.7\nmillion which was expected to be settled in fiscal 2022. Subsequent to the closing date and during the current fiscal year, the Company recognized the $7.7 million as an offset to selling, general and administrative expense as it was no longer expected to be paid. In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company assumed the Buffalo Group's debt of approximately $\n7.7\nmillion. The Company repaid all of the assumed Buffalo Group debt by the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2021.\nThe Company has recorded its preliminary purchase price allocation associated with the acquisition, which is summarized in Note 15-\nOther Business Combinations.\nOn March 6, 2020, a subsidiary of Jacobs completed the acquisition of the nuclear consulting, remediation and program management business of John Wood Group, a U.K.-based energy services company, for an enterprise value of £\n246\nmillion, or approximately $\n317.9\nmillion, less cash acquired of $\n24.3\nmillion. The Company has recorded its preliminary purchase price allocation associated with the acquisition, which is summarized in Note 15-\nOther Business Combinations.\nOn June 12, 2019, Jacobs completed the acquisition of The KeyW Holding Corporation (“KeyW”), a U.S.-based national security solutions provider to the intelligence, cyber, and counter terrorism communities, by acquiring\n100\n% of the outstanding shares of KeyW common stock. The Company paid total consideration of $\n902.6\nmillion, which was comprised of approximately $\n604.2\nmillion in cash to the former stockholders and certain equity award holders of KeyW and the assumption of KeyW’s debt of approximately $\n298.4\nmillion. The Company repaid all of the assumed KeyW debt by the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019. The Company has recorded its final purchase price allocation associated with the acquisition, which is summarized in Note 15-\nOther Business Combinations\n.\nOn April 26, 2019, Jacobs completed the sale of its Energy, Chemicals and Resources (\"ECR\") business to Worley Limited, a company incorporated in Australia (\"Worley\"), for a purchase price of $\n3.4\nbillion consisting of (i) $\n2.8\nbillion in cash plus (ii)\n58.2\nmillion ordinary shares of Worley, subject to adjustments for changes in working capital and certain other items (the “ECR sale”). As a result of the ECR sale, substantially all ECR-related assets and liabilities have been sold (the \"Disposal Group\"). We determined that the Disposal Group should be reported as discontinued operations in accordance with ASC 210-05,\nDiscontinued Operations\nbecause their disposal represents a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. As such, the financial results of the ECR business are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as discontinued operations for all periods presented. As of October 1, 2021, all of the ECR business to be sold under the terms of the sale has been conveyed to Worley and as such, no amounts remain held for sale. For further discussion see Note 16-\nSale of Energy, Chemicals and Resources (\"ECR\") Business\n.\n2.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Accounting for Contracts\nEngineering, Procurement & Construction Contracts and Service Contracts\nOn September 29, 2018, the Company adopted ASC Topic 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\nincluding the subsequent ASUs that amended and clarified the related guidance. The Company recognizes engineering, procurement, and construction contract revenue over time, as performance obligations are satisfied, due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer in accordance with ASC Topic 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n. Upon adoption of ASC Topic 606, contracts which include engineering, procurement and construction services are generally accounted for as a single deliverable (a single performance obligation) and are no longer segmented between types of services. In some instances, the Company’s services associated with a construction activity are limited to specific tasks such as customer support, consulting or supervisory services. In these instances, the services are typically identified as separate performance obligations.\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the percentage-of-completion method, based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract costs. The percentage-of-completion method (an input method) is the most representative depiction of the Company’s performance because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer. Subcontractor materials, labor and equipment and, in certain cases, customer-furnished materials and labor and equipment are included in revenue and cost of revenue when management believes that the company is acting as a principal rather than as an agent (e.g., the company integrates the materials, labor and equipment\nF-9\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\ninto the deliverables promised to the customer or is otherwise primarily responsible for fulfillment and acceptability of the materials, labor and/or equipment). The Company recognizes revenue, but not profit, on certain uninstalled materials that are not specifically produced, fabricated, or constructed for a project. Revenue on these uninstalled materials is recognized when control is transferred. Changes to total estimated contract cost or losses, if any, are recognized in the period in which they are determined as assessed at the contract level. Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred unless they are expected to be recovered from the client. Project mobilization costs are generally charged to project costs as incurred when they are an integrated part of the performance obligation being transferred to the client. Under the typical payment terms of our engineering, procurement and construction contracts, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms at periodic intervals (e.g., biweekly or monthly) and customer payments are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing, depending on the contract.\nFor service contracts, the Company recognizes revenue over time using the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method. Service contracts that include multiple performance obligations are segmented between types of services. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each distinct service in the contract. In some instances where the Company is standing ready to provide services, the Company recognizes revenue ratably over the service period. Under the typical payment terms of our service contracts, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, and customer payments are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing, depending on the contract.\nDirect costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts, including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in providing the services required by the related projects. The level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors, including the amount of pass-through costs we incur during a period. On those projects where we are acting as principal for subcontract labor or third-party materials and equipment, we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs (and we refer to such costs as “pass-through costs”).\nBack charges to suppliers or subcontractors are recognized as a reduction of cost when it is determined that recovery of such cost is probable and the amounts can be reliably estimated. Disputed back charges are recognized when the same requirements described above have been satisfied.\nVariable Consideration\nThe nature of the Company’s contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claims and unpriced change orders; awards and incentive fees; and liquidated damages and penalties. The Company recognizes revenue for variable consideration when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Company estimates the amount of revenue to be recognized on variable consideration using the expected value (i.e., the sum of a probability-weighted amount) or the most likely amount method, whichever is expected to better predict the amount. Factors considered in determining whether revenue associated with claims (including change orders in dispute and unapproved change orders in regard to both scope and price) should be recognized include the following: (a) the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim, (b) additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and not the result of deficiencies in the company’s performance, (c) claim-related costs are identifiable and considered reasonable in view of the work performed, and (d) evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable. If the requirements for recognizing revenue for claims or unapproved change orders are met, revenue is recorded only when the costs associated with the claims or unapproved change orders have been incurred and only up to the amount of cost incurred.\nThe Company generally provides limited warranties for work performed under its engineering and construction contracts. The warranty periods typically extend for a limited duration following substantial completion of the Company’s work on the project. Historically, warranty claims have not resulted in material costs incurred for which the Company was not compensated for by the customer.\nPractical Expedient\nIf the Company has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the Company’s performance completed to date (a service contract in which the company bills a fixed amount for each hour of service provided), the Company recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice for services performed.\nF-10\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe Company does not adjust the contract price for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the Company transfers a service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service will be one year or less.\nSee Note 3-\nRevenue Accounting for Contracts\nfor further discussion.\nJoint Ventures and VIEs\nAs is common to the industry, we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures. Although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients, the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners, or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures. Many of these joint ventures are formed for a specific project. The assets of our joint ventures generally consist almost entirely of cash and receivables (representing amounts due from clients), and the liabilities of our joint ventures generally consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners (for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts) and other subcontractors. In general, at any given time, the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients. Very few of our joint ventures have employees or third-party debt or credit facilities. The debt held by the joint ventures is non-recourse to the general credit of Jacobs.\nThe assets of a joint venture are restricted for use to the obligations of the particular joint venture and are not available for general operations of the Company. Our risk of loss on these arrangements is usually shared with our partners. The liability of each partner is usually joint and several, which means that each partner may become liable for the entire risk of loss on the project. Furthermore, on some of our projects, the Company has granted guarantees which may encumber both our contracting subsidiary company and the Company for the entire risk of loss on the project. The Company is unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under outstanding performance guarantees related to joint venture projects due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, the nature and extent of any contractual defaults by our joint venture partners, resource availability, potential performance delays caused by the defaults, the location of the projects, and the terms of the related contracts. See Note 19-\nContractual Guarantees, Litigation, Investigations and Insurance\nfor further discussion.\nMost of the joint ventures are deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIE”) because they lack sufficient equity to finance the activities of the joint venture. The Company uses a qualitative approach to determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, which considers factors that indicate a party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the joint venture’s economic performance. These factors include the composition of the governing board, how board decisions are approved, the powers granted to the operational manager(s) and partner that holds that position(s), and to a certain extent, the partner’s economic interest in the joint venture. The Company analyzes each joint venture initially to determine if it should be consolidated or unconsolidated.\n•\nConsolidated if the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, or holds the majority of voting interests of a non-VIE (and no significant participative rights are available to the other partners).\n•\nUnconsolidated if the Company is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE, or does not hold the majority of voting interest of a non-VIE.\nOur unconsolidated joint ventures (including equity method investments) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable, and impairment losses are recognized for such investments if there is a decline in fair value below carrying value that is considered to be other-than-temporary.\nSee Note 8-\nJoint Ventures, VIEs and Other Investments\nfor further discussion.\nFair Value Measurements\nCertain amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented at “fair value.” Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the date fair value is determined (the “measurement date”). When determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we consider only those assumptions we believe a typical market participant would consider when pricing an asset or liability. In measuring fair value, we use the following inputs in the order of priority indicated:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nF-11\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, such as (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; (ii) quoted prices in markets that have insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (e.g., less active markets); and (iii) model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated with, observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe net carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and payables and short-term debt approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. See Note 9-\nBorrowings\nfor a discussion of the fair value of long-term debt.\nCertain other assets and liabilities, such as forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements we purchased as cash-flow hedges discussed in Note 18-\nCommitments and Contingencies and Derivative Financial Instruments\nand the Company's investment in Worley ordinary shares discussed in Note 16 -\nSale of Energy, Chemicals and Resources\nare required to be carried in our Consolidated Financial Statements at Fair Value.\nThe fair value of the Company’s reporting units (used for purposes of determining whether there is an indication of possible impairment of the carrying value of goodwill) is determined using an income and market approach. Both approaches require us to make certain estimates and judgments. Under the income approach, fair value is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units. Under the market approach, the fair values of our reporting units are determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to our reporting units; the fair values are estimated based on the valuation multiples of the invested capital associated with the guideline companies. In assessing whether there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired, we utilize the results of both valuation techniques and consider the range of fair values indicated.\nWith respect to equity-based compensation (i.e., share-based payments), we estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Like all option-pricing models, the Black-Scholes model requires the use of subjective assumptions including (i) the expected volatility of the market price of the underlying stock, and (ii) the expected term of the award, among others. Accordingly, changes in assumptions and any subsequent adjustments to those assumptions can cause different fair values to be assigned to our future stock option awards. For restricted stock awards (including restricted stock units) containing market conditions, compensation expense is based on the fair value of such awards using a Monte Carlo simulation. For restricted stock awards (including restricted stock units) containing service and performance conditions, compensation expense is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant.\nThe fair values of the assets owned by the various pension plans that the Company sponsors are determined based on the type of asset, consistent with U.S. GAAP. Equity securities are valued by using market observable data such as quoted prices. Publicly traded corporate equity securities are valued at the last reported sale price on the last business day of the year. Securities not traded on the last business day are valued at the last reported bid price. Fixed income investment funds categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals), bids provided by brokers or dealers, or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Real estate consists primarily of common or collective trusts, with underlying investments in real estate. These investments are valued using the best information available, including quoted market price, market prices for similar assets when available, internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate, or independent appraisals, as appropriate. Management values insurance contracts and hedge funds using actuarial assumptions and certain values reported by fund managers.\nThe methodologies described above and elsewhere in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements may produce a fair value measure that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement.\nCash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents at October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020 consisted primarily of money market mutual funds and overnight bank deposits.\nF-12\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nReceivables, Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities\nReceivables include amounts billed, net and unbilled receivables. Amounts billed, net consist of amounts invoiced to clients in accordance with the terms of our client contracts and are shown net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. We anticipate that substantially all of such billed amounts will be collected over the next twelve months.\nUnbilled receivables and other, which represent an unconditional right to payment subject only to the passage of time in connection with our client contracts, are reclassified to amounts billed when they are billed under the terms of the contract. Prior to adoption of ASC 606, receivables related to contractual milestones or achievement of performance-based targets were included in unbilled receivables. These are now included in contract assets. We anticipate that substantially all of such unbilled amounts will be billed and collected over the next twelve months.\nContract assets represent unbilled amounts where the right to payment is subject to more than merely the passage of time and includes performance-based incentives and services provided ahead of agreed contractual milestones. Contract assets are transferred to unbilled receivables when the right to consideration becomes unconditional and are transferred to amounts billed upon invoicing.\nContract liabilities represent amounts billed to clients in excess of revenue recognized to date. We anticipate that substantially all such amounts will be earned over the next twelve months.\nIn order to manage short-term liquidity and credit exposure, Jacobs may sell current customer receivables to third parties. When Jacobs sells customer receivables to third parties it accelerates the receipt of cash that would otherwise have been collected from customers and records these transactions as reductions to the receivable amounts. Jacobs does not maintain continuing involvement in these arrangements.\nProperty, Equipment, and Improvements\nProperty, equipment and improvements are carried at cost, and are shown net of accumulated depreciation and amortization in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Depreciation and amortization is computed primarily by using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the related lease. Estimated useful lives range from\n20\nto\n40\nyears for buildings, from\n3\nto\n10\nyears for equipment and from\n4\nto\n10\nyears for leasehold improvements.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized; instead, on an annual basis we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for possible impairment. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of those assets.\nFor purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is assigned to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure. We have determined that our operating segments are also our reporting units based on management’s conclusion that the components comprising each of our operating segments share similar economic characteristics and meet the aggregation criteria in accordance with ASC 350.\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter each year. We begin with the qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the quantitative assessment described below.\nIf it is determined through the evaluation of events or circumstances that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the Company then compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. During 2021, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test and qualitatively determined that none of our goodwill was impaired. We have determined that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values for the Consolidated Balance Sheets presented.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets other than goodwill principally consist of right-of-use lease assets, property, equipment and improvements, and finite-lived intangible assets. These long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment for each of our asset groups in accordance with ASC 360 by first identifying whether indicators of impairment exist. If such indicators are present, we assess long-lived asset groups for recoverability based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows. For asset\nF-13\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\ngroups where the recoverability test fails, the fair value of each asset group is then estimated and compared to its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which an asset group’s carrying value exceeds its fair value.\nForeign Currencies\nIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, it is necessary to translate the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the U.S., which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, into the U.S. dollar. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, revenues and expenses of operations outside the U.S. are translated into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates for the applicable periods being translated while the assets and liabilities of operations outside the U.S. are generally translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The net effect of foreign currency translation adjustments is included in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nShare-Based Payments\nWe measure the value of services received from employees and directors in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The computed value is recognized as a non-cash cost on a straight-line basis over the period the individual provides services, which is typically the vesting period of the award with the exception of awards containing an internal performance measure, such as Earnings Per Share growth and Return on Invested Capital, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period subject to the probability of meeting the performance requirements and adjusted for the number of shares expected to be earned. The cost of these awards is recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nOur cash balances and cash equivalents are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, India, Australia, Africa and Asia. In the normal course of business, and consistent with industry practices, we grant credit to our clients without requiring collateral. Concentrations of credit risk is the risk that, if we extend a significant amount of credit to clients in a specific geographic area or industry, we may experience disproportionately high levels of default if those clients are adversely affected by factors particular to their geographic area or industry. Concentrations of credit risk relative to trade receivables are limited due to our diverse client base, which includes the U.S. federal government and multi-national corporations operating in a broad range of industries and geographic areas. Additionally, in order to mitigate credit risk, we continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our major commercial clients.\nLeases\nOn September 28, 2019 the Company adopted ASU 2016-02,\nLeases (\"ASC 842\")\n, along with ASU 2018-01, ASU 2018-10, ASU 2018-11, ASU 2018-20 and ASU 2019-01, which amended and clarified the related guidance. ASC 842 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. A lease exists when a contract conveys to the customer the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The definition of a lease embodies two conditions: (1) there is an identified asset in the contract, and (2) the customer has the right to control the use of the identified asset. Lessees are required to classify leases as either finance or operating leases. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nASC 842 provided several optional practical expedients for use in transition to and ongoing application of ASC 842. The Company elected to utilize the package of practical expedients in ASC 842-10-65-1(f) that, upon adoption of ASC 842, allows entities to (1) not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) retain the classification of leases (e.g., operating or finance lease) existing as of the date of adoption and (3) not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases. The Company did not elect the practical expedient pertaining to the use of hindsight. The Company elected to utilize the practical expedient in ASC 842-10-15-37 in which the Company has chosen to account for each separate lease component of a contract and its associated non-lease components as a single lease component.\nThe Company’s right-of use assets and lease liabilities relate to real estate, project assets used in connection with long-term construction contracts, IT assets and vehicles. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of\none year\nto\nthirteen years\n. The Company’s lease obligations are primarily for the use of office space and are primarily operating leases. Certain of the Company’s leases contain renewal, extension, or termination options. The Company assesses each option on an individual basis and will only include options reasonably certain of exercise in the lease term. The Company generally considers the base term to be the term provided in the contract. None of the Company’s lease agreements contain material options to purchase the leased property, material residual value guarantees, or material restrictions or covenants.\nF-14\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nLong-term project asset and vehicle leases (leases with terms greater than twelve months), along with all real estate and IT asset leases, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid. Because the Company primarily acts as a lessee and the rates implicit in its leases are not readily determinable, the Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate on the lease commencement date to calculate the present value of future lease payments. Certain leases include payments that are based solely on an index or rate. These variable lease payments are included in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability and are initially measured using the index or rate at the lease commencement date. Other variable lease payments, such as payments based on use and for property taxes, insurance, or common area maintenance that are based on actual assessments are excluded from the ROU asset and lease liability and are expensed as incurred. In addition to the present value of the future lease payments, the calculation of the ROU asset also includes any deferred rent, lease prepayments and initial direct costs of obtaining the lease, such as commissions.\nCertain lease contracts contain nonlease components such as maintenance and utilities. The Company has made an accounting policy election, as allowed under ASC 842-10-15-37 and discussed above, to capitalize both the lease component and nonlease components of its contracts as a single lease component for all of its right-of-use assets.\nShort-term project asset and vehicle leases (project asset and vehicle leases with an initial term of twelve months or less or leases that are cancellable by the lessee and lessor without significant penalties) are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The majority of the Company’s short-term leases relate to equipment used on construction projects. These leases are entered into at agreed upon hourly, daily, weekly or monthly rental rates for an unspecified duration and typically have a termination for convenience provision. Such equipment leases are considered short-term in nature unless it is reasonably certain that the equipment will be leased for a term greater than twelve months.\nPensions\nWe use certain assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the assets and liabilities of our pension plans. These assumptions involve discount rates, investment returns and projected salary increases, among others. Changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material effect on the plans’ liabilities and the projected pension expense.\nWe use a corridor approach to amortize actuarial gains and losses. Under this approach, net gains or losses in excess of ten percent of the larger of the pension benefit obligation or the market-related value of the assets are amortized on a straight-line basis. The period of amortization is the average remaining service of active participants who are expected to receive benefits under certain plans and the average remaining future lifetime of plan participants for certain plans.\nWe measure our defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the end of the month closest to their fiscal year end, which is September 30, 2021 as the alternative measurement date in accordance with FASB guidance ASU 2015-04, Compensation Retirement Benefit (Topic 715):\nPractical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer’s Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Asset\n. This guidance allows employers with fiscal year ends that do not coincide with a calendar month end to make an accounting policy election to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the end of the month closest to their fiscal year end.\nF-15\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nIn connection with the PA Consulting investment, the Company recorded redeemable noncontrolling interests, representing the interest holders'\n35\n% equity interest in the form of preferred and common shares of PA Consulting. The preferred shares are entitled to a cumulative annual compounding\n12\n% dividend based on the outstanding preferred share subscription price. These interest holders have certain option rights to put the preferred and common share interests back to the Company at a value based on the fair value of PA Consulting (the redemption values). Additionally, the Company has an option to call the interests for certain individual shareholders in certain circumstances. Because the interests are redeemable at the option of the holders and not solely within the control of the Company, the Company classified the interests in redeemable noncontrolling interests within its Consolidated Balance Sheet at their redemption values. The optional redemption features may become exercisable no earlier than\nfive years\nfrom the March 2, 2021 closing date, or upon the occurrence of certain other events.\nThe Company has deemed these interests probable of becoming redeemable in the future and requiring their measurement at the greater of (i) the redemption amount that would be paid if settlement occurred at the balance sheet date, or (ii) the historical value resulting from the original acquisition date fair value plus the impact of any earnings or loss attribution amounts, including dividends.\nThe fair value of the the PA Consulting redeemable noncontrolling interest is determined using an income and market approach.\nFurther, any excess in redemption amounts over the historical values of the interests is recognized as an increase to redeemable noncontrolling interests and an offsetting decrease in consolidated retained earnings. Additionally, particular to the preference share and in certain circumstances the ordinary share components of redeemable noncontrolling interests, such decrease in consolidated retained earnings is also reflected as a corresponding downward adjustment to net earnings attributable to Jacobs for purposes of the calculation of consolidated earnings per share attributable to common shareholders.\nIncome Taxes\nWe determine our consolidated income tax expense using the asset and liability method prescribed by U.S.\nGAAP. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. If and when we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realized for its full amount, we will recognize and record a\nvaluation allowance with a corresponding charge to earnings. Judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. In the normal course of business, we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome\n(including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense) is uncertain. Additionally, we file income, franchise, gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions. Our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states in the U.S., and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the U.S.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") contains a provision which subjects a U.S. parent of a foreign subsidiary to current U.S. tax on its global intangible low–taxed income (“GILTI”). The GILTI income is eligible for a deduction, which lowers the effective tax rate to 10.5% for calendar years 2018 through 2025 and 13.125% after 2025. The Company will report the tax impact of GILTI as a period cost when incurred. Accordingly, the Company is not providing deferred taxes for basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI.\nContractual Guarantees, Litigation, Investigations and Insurance\nIn the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation. We record in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees, litigation and insurance claims. Guarantees are accounted for in accordance with ASC 460-10,\nGuarantees\n, at fair value at the inception of the guarantee. We perform an analysis to determine the level of reserves to establish for both insurance-related claims that are known and have been asserted against us as well as for insurance-related claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis, but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates. We include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In addition, as a contractor providing services to various agencies of the U.S. federal government, we are subject to many levels of audits, investigations, and claims by, or on behalf of, the U.S. federal government with respect to contract performance, pricing, costs, cost allocations and procurement practices. We adjust revenues based upon the amounts we expect to realize considering the effects of any client audits or governmental investigations.\nF-16\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nBusiness Combinations\nU.S. GAAP requires that the purchase price paid for business combinations accounted for using the acquisition method be allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their respective Fair Values. The Company makes certain estimates and judgments relating to other assets and liabilities acquired as well as any identifiable intangible assets acquired.\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to employ estimates and make assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities; the revenues and expenses reported for the periods covered by the financial statements; and certain amounts disclosed in these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Although such estimates and assumptions are based on management’s most recent assessment of the underlying facts and circumstances utilizing the most current information available and past experience, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are evaluated periodically and adjusted accordingly.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nASU 2017-04,\nSimplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\nis effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. ASU 2017-04 removed the second step of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. An entity will now recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The adoption of ASU 2017-04 had no impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nASU No. 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (\"ASC 326\"): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\nrequires entities to use a current lifetime expected credit loss methodology to measure impairments of certain financial assets. Using this methodology will result in earlier recognition of losses than under the current incurred loss approach, which requires waiting to recognize a loss until it is probable of having been incurred. There are other provisions within the standard that affect how impairments of other financial assets may be recorded and presented, and that expand disclosures. This standard was effective beginning with the first fiscal quarter 2021. The adoption of ASU 326 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nASU 2020-04,\nReference Rate Reform\n,\n(Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\nis intended to provide relief for entities impacted by reference rate reform and contains provisions and optional expedients designed to simplify requirements around designation of hedging relationships, probability assessments of hedged forecasted transactions and accounting for modifications of contracts that refer to LIBOR or other rates affected by reference rate reform. The guidance is elective and is effective on the date of issuance. ASU 2020-04 is applied prospectively to contract modifications and as of the effective date for existing and new eligible hedging relationships. The guidance is temporary and will generally not be applicable to transactions which occur after December 31, 2022. Management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2020-04 to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n3.\nRevenue Accounting for Contracts\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nOur revenues are principally derived from contracts to provide a diverse range of technical, professional, and construction services to a large number of industrial, commercial, and governmental clients. We provide a broad range of engineering, design, and architectural services; construction and construction management services; operations and maintenance services; and process, scientific, and systems consulting services. We provide our services through offices and subsidiaries located primarily in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, India, Australia, Africa, and Asia. We provide our services under cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts. Our contracts are with many different customers in numerous industries. Refer to Note 20-\nSegment Information\nfor additional information on how we disaggregate our revenues by reportable segment.\nThe following table further disaggregates our revenue by geographic area for the years ended October 1, 2021, October 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019 (in thousands):\nF-17\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following table presents the revenues earned directly or indirectly from the U.S. federal government and its agencies, expressed as a percentage of total revenues:\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities represent amounts billed to clients in excess of revenue recognized to date. Revenue recognized for the year ended October 1, 2021 that was included in the contract liability balance on October 2, 2020 was $\n405\nmillion. Revenue recognized for the year ended October 2, 2020 that was included in the contract liability balance on September 27, 2019 was $\n410\nmillion.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe Company’s remaining performance obligations as of October 1, 2021 represent a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress. The Company had approximately $\n14.9\nbillion in remaining performance obligations as of October 1, 2021. The Company expects to recognize\n52\n% of our remaining performance obligations within the next twelve months and the remaining\n48\n% thereafter.\nAlthough remaining performance obligations reflect business that is considered to be firm, cancellations, scope adjustments, foreign currency exchange fluctuations or project deferrals may occur that impact their volume or the expected timing of their recognition. Remaining performance obligations are adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, foreign currency exchange fluctuations and project deferrals, as appropriate.\n4.\nEarnings Per Share and Certain Related Information\nBasic and Diluted Earnings Per Share\nBasic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines EPS for common shares and participating securities. The undistributed earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed earnings. Net earnings used for the purpose of determining basic and diluted EPS is determined by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities and the preferred redeemable noncontrolling interests redemption value adjustment associated with the PA Consulting transaction.\nF-18\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe following table reconciles the denominator used to compute basic EPS to the denominator used to compute diluted EPS for the years ended October 1, 2021, October 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019 (in thousands):\nF-19\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nShare Repurchases\nOn January 17, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock, to expire on January 16, 2022 (the \"2019 Repurchase Authorization\"). On January 16, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an additional share repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion of the Company's common stock, to expire on January 15, 2023 (the \"2020 Repurchase Authorization\"). In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 the Company launched an accelerated share repurchase program by advancing $250 million to a financial institution in a privately negotiated transaction.\nThe following table summarizes the activity under the 2019 and 2020 Repurchase Authorizations during fiscal 2021:\n(1)\nIncludes commissions paid and calculated at the average price per share\nAs a precautionary measure in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company temporarily suspended purchases under the share repurchase plan in March 2020, with such suspension remaining in effect through the fiscal third quarter of 2020. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2020, the Company resumed share repurchases. As of October 1, 2021, the Company has\nno\nremaining amounts available under the 2019 Repurchase Authorization and $\n782.9\nmillion remaining under the 2020 Repurchase Authorization.\nOur share repurchase programs do not obligate the Company to purchase any shares. Share repurchases may be executed through various means including, without limitation, accelerated share repurchases, open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or otherwise. The authorization for the share repurchase programs may be terminated, increased or decreased by the Company’s Board of Directors in its discretion at any time. The timing, amount and manner of share repurchases may depend upon market conditions and economic circumstances, availability of investment opportunities, the availability and costs of financing, currency fluctuations, the market price of the Company's common stock, other uses of capital and other factors.\nCommon and Preferred Stock\nJacobs is authorized to issue two classes of capital stock designated “common stock” and “preferred stock” (each has a par value of $\n1.00\nper share). The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series. The number of shares to be included in a series as well as each series’ designation, relative powers, dividend and other preferences, rights and qualifications, redemption provisions and restrictions are to be fixed by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time each series is issued.

The rate change resulted in an increase to our net deferred tax liabilities of $\n25.6\nmillion and a corresponding increase to income tax expense for the year ended October 1, 2021. Our income tax expense in the United Kingdom will be based on the new rate beginning in April 2023.\nA valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on an assessment of positive and negative evidence, including estimates of future taxable income necessary to realize future deductible amounts. The valuation allowance was $\n188.7\nmillion at October 1, 2021 and $\n140.6\nmillion at October 2, 2020. Of the $\n48.1\nmillion increase in the valuation allowance, $\n27.4\nmillion relates to a change in judgment on the realizability of domestic deferred tax assets which are capital in nature with no expected capital gains to be able to realize them, $\n11.7\nmillion for a change in judgment on the realizability on state net operating losses, a change of $\n4.6\nmillion from certain deferred tax assets acquired in the PA Consulting acquisition which have been determined to not be realizable, $\n3.5\nmillion relates to a tax rate change in the U.K., and $\n0.9\nmillion attributable to current year activity.\nAt October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020, the domestic and international net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards totaled $\n760.4\nmillion and $\n783.9\nmillion, resulting in an NOL deferred tax asset of $\n197.9\nmillion and $\n198.0\nmillion, respectively.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nThe Company accounts for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with ASC Topic 740,\nIncome Taxes\n. It accounts for interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as interest and penalties reported above the line (i.e., not as part of income tax expense). The Company’s liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits was $\n91.9\nmillion and $\n93.4\nmillion at October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020, respectively, after ASU 2013-11 netting of $\n21.7\nmillion and $\n9.1\nmillion, respectively. If recognized, $\n84.7\nmillion would affect the Company’s consolidated effective income tax rate. The Company had $\n41.6\nmillion and $\n40.4\nmillion in accrued interest and penalties at October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020, respectively. The Company estimates that, within twelve months, we may realize a decrease in our uncertain tax positions of approximately $\n5.5\nmillion as a result of concluding various tax audits and closing tax years, as well as an estimated decrease of $\n15.4\nmillion related to the filing of an amended return which would remove the uncertain tax position from the balance sheet. As of October 1, 2021, the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns for tax years 2013 and forward remain subject to examination.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for both continuing and discontinued operations, with PA Consulting related impacts added and with ECR-sale related impacts removed in the Acquisitions/Divestitures row, for the years ended October 1, 2021, October 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019 (in thousands):\nOn March 2, 2021, Jacobs completed the strategic investment of a\n65\n% interest in PA Consulting. On November 24, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Buffalo Group. On March 6, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of John Wood Group's nuclear business and on June 12, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of KeyW. For income tax purposes, the PA Consulting, John Wood Group's nuclear business and KeyW transactions were accounted for as stock purchases, while the Buffalo Group transaction was structured as an asset purchase. As a result of the acquisitions, the Company adjusted its U.S. GAAP opening balance sheet of PA Consulting, Buffalo Group, John Wood Group and KeyW to reflect estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired. For income tax purposes, the tax attributes and basis of net assets acquired carryover without any step-up to fair value in the transactions structured as a stock purchase. However, in the Buffalo Group transaction, the basis of the net assets acquired were stepped up to fair value, as the sale was treated as a purchase of assets. For PA Consulting and Buffalo Group, the Company has made preliminary estimates and recorded deferred taxes associated with the purchase accounting. It is expected that the Company will make adjustments to the purchase accounting over the relevant measurement period as allowed by ASC 805. For John Wood Group's nuclear business and KeyW, the Company completed its purchase accounting in the current and prior fiscal years, respectively.\nF-27\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC.

Likewise, the entire amount of each of the assets and liabilities are included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. There are no consolidated VIEs that have debt or credit facilities.\nSummary financial information of consolidated VIEs is as follows (in millions):\nOn March 2, 2021, Jacobs completed the strategic investment of a\n65\n% interest in PA Consulting, a UK-based leading innovation and transformation consulting firm. The remaining\n35\n% interest is held by PA Consulting employees. PA Consulting is accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary under U.S. GAAP accounting rules. See Note 14-\nPA Consulting Business Combination\nfor more discussion on the acquisition.\nUnconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method or proportionate consolidation. Proportionate consolidation is used for joint ventures that include unincorporated legal entities and activities of the joint venture are construction-related. For those joint ventures accounted for under proportionate consolidation, only the Company’s pro rata share of assets, liabilities, revenue, and costs are included in the Company’s balance sheet and results of operations.\nFor the proportionate consolidated VIEs, the carrying value of assets and liabilities was $\n115.1\nmillion and $\n129.5\nmillion as of October 1, 2021, respectively and $\n64.1\nmillion and $\n63.0\nmillion as of October 2, 2020, respectively. For those joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, the Company's investment balances for the joint venture is included in other noncurrent Assets: miscellaneous on the balance sheet and the Company’s pro rata share of net income is included in revenue. In limited cases, there are basis differences between the equity in the joint venture and Jacobs' investment created when Jacobs purchased their share of the joint venture. These basis differences are amortized based on an internal allocation to underlying net assets, excluding allocations to goodwill. As of October 1, 2021, the Company’s equity method investments exceeded its share of venture net assets by $\n36.8\nmillion. Our investments in equity method joint ventures on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020 were a net asset of $\n121.3\nmillion and $\n161.3\nmillion, respectively. During the years ended October 1, 2021, October 2, 2020, and September 27, 2019, we recognized income from equity method joint ventures of $\n60.9\nmillion, $\n82.2\nmillion, and $\n48.5\nmillion, respectively.\nF-28\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC.

As of October 2, 2020, AWE was under a contractual operating arrangement with the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) with multiple years remaining under the arrangement. On November 2, 2020, the MoD unexpectedly announced plans to change its current operating agreements with AWE that would result in the early termination of the current contract in 2021. During the fiscal year ended October 1, 2021, the Company recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges on its investment in AWE in the amount of $\n38.5\nmillion, which were included in miscellaneous income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of earnings.\nAt October 2, 2020, the Company held a cost method investment in C3.ai, Inc.

On December 9, 2020, C3 completed an initial public offering and as a result the Company carried its investment in C3 at fair value, with mark to market changes reflected in net income as it is an investment in equity securities with a readily determinable fair value based on quoted market prices. During the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2021 and subsequent to the IPO, the Company sold all shares owned in C3, at a realized pre-tax gain of $\n49.6\nmillion. Dividend income, unrealized gains and losses on changes in fair value and related realized gains and losses on disposal of the C3 shares have been recognized in miscellaneous income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of earnings.\nF-29\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC.

On March 27, 2019, the Company entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\") which amended and restated the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility by, among other things, (a) extending the maturity date of the credit facility to March 27, 2024, (b) increasing the facility amount to $\n2.25\nbillion (with an accordion feature that allows a further increase of the facility amount up to $\n3.25\nbillion), (c) eliminating the covenants restricting investments, joint ventures and acquisitions by the Company and its subsidiaries and (d) adjusting the financial covenants to eliminate the net worth covenant upon the removal of the same covenant from the Company’s existing Note Purchase Agreement (defined below). We were in compliance with the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility at October 1, 2021.\nOn December 16, 2020, Jacobs entered into a first amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility, which provides for, among other things, (a) administrative changes allowing a one-time limited conditionality draw under the Revolving Credit Facility in connection with the March 2, 2021 investment by the Company, indirectly through a subsidiary of the Company, of a majority interest in PA Consulting and (b) an increase in the interest rate applicable margin to\n1.625\n% per annum if the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) of the Company is equal to or greater than\n3.00\nto 1.00.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility permits the Company to borrow under\ntwo\nseparate tranches in U.S. dollars, certain specified foreign currencies, and any other currency that may be approved in accordance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility also provides for a financial letter of credit sub facility of $\n400.0\nmillion, permits performance letters of credit, and provides for a $\n50.0\nmillion sub facility for swing line loans. Letters of credit are subject to fees based on the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio. The Company pays a facility fee of between\n0.08\n% and\n0.23\n% per annum depending on the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio.\nF-30\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nOn March 25, 2020, the Company entered into an unsecured term loan facility (the “2020 Term Loan Facility”) with a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders. Under the 2020 Term Loan Facility, the Company borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $\n730.0\nmillion and one of the Company's U.K. subsidiaries borrowed an aggregate principal amount of £\n250.0\nmillion. The proceeds of the term loans were used to repay the Bilateral Term Loan and for general corporate purposes. The 2020 Term Loan Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type that are consistent with those included in the Revolving Credit Facility. During fiscal 2020, the Company entered into interest rate and cross currency derivative contracts to swap a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. See Note 18-\nCommitments and Contingencies and Derivative Financial Instruments\nfor discussion regarding the Company's derivative instruments.\nOn January 20, 2021, the Company entered into an unsecured delayed draw term loan facility (the “2021 Term Loan Facility”) with a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders. Under the 2021 Term Loan Facility, the Company borrowed an aggregate principal amount of $\n200.0\nmillion and £\n650.0\nmillion. The proceeds of the term loans were used primarily to fund the Company's investment in PA Consulting. The 2021 Term Loan Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type that are consistent with those included in the Revolving Credit Facility and the 2020 Term Loan Facility.\nThe 2020 Term Loan Facility and the 2021 Term Loan Facility are together referred to as the \"Term Loan Facilities\". We were in compliance with the covenants under the Term Loan Facilities at October 1, 2021.\nOn March 12, 2018, Jacobs entered into a note purchase agreement (as amended, the \"Note Purchase Agreement\") with respect to the issuance and sale in a private placement transaction of $\n500.0\nmillion in the aggregate principal amount of the Company’s senior notes in three series (collectively, the “Senior Notes”). The Note Purchase Agreement provides that if the Company's consolidated leverage ratio exceeds a certain amount, the interest on the Senior Notes may increase by\n75\nbasis points. The Senior Notes may be prepaid at any time subject to a make-whole premium. The sale of the Senior Notes closed on May 15, 2018. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering of Senior Notes to repay certain existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes. The Note Purchase Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type, including, among other things, covenants to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth and maximum consolidated leverage ratio and limitations on certain liens, mergers, dispositions and transactions with affiliates. In addition, the Note Purchase Agreement contains customary events of default. We were in compliance with the covenants under the Note Purchase Agreement at October 1, 2021.\nWe believe the carrying value of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan Facilities and other debt approximates fair value based on the interest rates and scheduled maturities applicable to the outstanding borrowings. The fair value of the Senior Notes is estimated to be $\n555.5\nmillion at October 1, 2021, based on Level 2 inputs. The fair value is determined by discounting future cash flows using interest rates available for issuances with similar terms and average maturities.\nThe Company has issued $\n1.7\nmillion in letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility, leaving $\n1.92\nbillion of available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility at October 1, 2021.

These initiatives during the prior year resulted in the actual abandonment of certain leased office spaces and the establishment of a formal plan to sublease certain other leased spaces that will no longer be utilized by the Company. In connection with the Company’s actions related to these initiatives, the Company evaluated certain of its lease right-of-use assets and related property, equipment and leasehold improvements for impairment under ASC 360.\nAs a result of the analysis, the Company recognized an impairment loss during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 of $\n162\nmillion, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statement of earnings for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2020.

Such plans cover substantially all of our domestic, nonunion employees in the U.S. and are qualified under Section 401(k) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Similar plans outside the U.S. cover various groups of employees of our international subsidiaries and affiliates. Several of these plans allow the Company to match, on a voluntary basis, a portion of the employee contributions.\nThe following table presents the Company’s contributions to these savings plans for the years ended October 1, 2021, October 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019 (in thousands):\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nOur non-qualified deferred compensation programs provide benefits payable to directors, officers, and certain key employees or their designated beneficiaries at specified future dates, upon retirement, or death. The plans are unfunded; therefore, benefits are paid from the general assets of the Company. Participants' cash deferrals earn a return based on the participants' selection of investments in several hypothetical investment options. Participants are also able to defer stock based compensation in the plans, which must remain invested in Company stock and are distributed in shares of Jacobs common stock. Since no investment diversification is permitted, changes in the fair value of Jacobs' common stock are not recognized. For the deferred compensation held in company stock, the number of shares needed to settle the liability is included in the denominator in both the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.\nThe following table presents the amount charged to expense for the Company’s deferred compensation plans for the years ended October 1, 2021, October 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019 (in thousands):\nThe following table presents the amount relating to assets held as deferred compensation arrangement investments for the years ended October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020 (in thousands):\nDeferred compensation arrangement investments are comprised primarily of the cash surrender value of life insurance policies and pooled-investment funds. The fair value of the pooled investment funds is derived using Level 2 inputs.\n13.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nCompany-Only Sponsored Plans\nWe sponsor various defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans covering employees of certain U.S. and international subsidiaries. The pension plans provide pension benefits that are based on the employee’s compensation and years of service. Our funding policy varies by country and plan according to applicable local funding requirements and plan-specific funding agreements.\nF-37\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nOn March 2, 2021, Jacobs completed the strategic investment of a\n65\n% interest in PA Consulting, a UK-based leading innovation and transformation consulting firm. PA Consulting has defined benefit plans that Jacobs now includes in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 14-\nPA Consulting Business Combination\nfor more discussion on the investment and the related defined benefit plans.\nThe accounting for pension and other post-retirement benefit plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic benefit cost and the value of the plans’ assets and benefit obligations. These assumptions include discount rates, investment returns, and projected salary increases, among others. The discount rates used in valuing the plans' benefit obligations were determined with reference to high quality corporate and government bonds that are appropriately matched to the duration of each plan's obligations. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally based on using country-specific simulation models which select a single outcome for expected return based on the target asset allocation. The expected long-term rates of return used in the valuation are the annual average returns generated by these assumptions over a\n20\n-year period for each asset class based on the expected long-term rate of return of the underlying assets.\nThe following table sets forth the changes in the plans’ combined net benefit obligation (segregated between plans existing within and outside the U.S.) for the years ended October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020 (in thousands):\n(1)\nCurrent year actuarial gains primarily driven by change in discount rates.\n(2)\nSee note below change in assets table.\nThe following table sets forth the changes in the combined Fair Value of the plans’ assets (segregated between plans existing within and outside the U.S.) for the years ended October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020 (in thousands):\nF-38\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC.

These factors include the projected, long-term rates of returns on the various types of assets in which the plans invest, as well as historical returns. In general, investment allocations are determined by each plan’s trustees and/or investment committees. The objectives of the plans’ investment policies are to (i) maximize returns while preserving capital; (ii) provide returns sufficient to meet the current and long-term obligations of the plan as the obligations become due; and (iii) maintain a diversified portfolio of assets so as to reduce the risk associated with having a disproportionate amount of the plans’ total assets invested in any one type of asset, issuer or geography. None of our pension plans hold Jacobs common stock directly (although some plans may hold shares indirectly through investments in mutual funds).\nThe plans’ weighted average asset allocations at October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020 (the measurement dates used in valuing the plans’ assets and liabilities) were as follows:\nThe following table presents the Fair Value of the Company’s Domestic U.S. plan assets at October 1, 2021, segregated by level of Fair Value measurement inputs within the Fair Value hierarchy promulgated by U.S. GAAP (in thousands):\nF-41\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC.

Contributions are based on the hours worked by employees covered under these agreements and are charged to direct costs of contracts on a current basis. With respect to these multiemployer plans, the Company's liability to fund these plans is generally limited to the contributions we are required to make under collective bargaining agreements.\nBased on our review of our multiemployer pension plans under the guidance provided in ASU 2011-09—\nCompensation-Retirement Benefits-Multiemployer Plans\n, we have concluded that none of the multiemployer pension plans into which we contribute are individually significant to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The total consideration paid by the Company was $\n1.7\nbillion, funded through cash on hand, proceeds from a new term loan and draws on the Company's existing revolver. Further, in connection with the transaction, an additional $261 million in investment proceeds had not yet been distributed at the investment date due to continuing employment requirements of associated management owners. Consequently, this amount represented compensation expense incurred related to the investment that was expensed subsequent to the acquisition date, and is reflected in selling, general and administrative expense and cash from operations for the current fiscal year. The remaining 35% interest is held by PA Consulting employees, whose redeemable noncontrolling interests had a fair value of $\n582.4\nmillion on the closing date, including subsequent purchase accounting adjustments. PA Consulting is accounted for as a consolidated subsidiary and as a separate operating segment under U.S. GAAP accounting rules. See Note 9 -\nBorrowings\nfor more discussion on the financing for the transaction.\nThe following summarizes the fair values of PA Consulting's assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date (in millions):\nThe purchase price allocation is based upon preliminary information and is subject to change when additional information is obtained. Goodwill recognized results from a substantial assembled workforce, which does not qualify for separate recognition, as well as expected future economic benefits. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The Company has not completed its final assessment of the fair values of PA Consulting's assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The final purchase price allocation could result in adjustments to certain assets and liabilities, including the residual amount allocated to goodwill.\nSince the initial preliminary estimates recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company has updated certain provisional amounts reflected in the preliminary purchase price allocation, as summarized in the estimated fair values of PA Consulting assets acquired and liabilities assumed above. See below for further discussion on updates to redeemable noncontrolling interests.\nIdentifiable intangibles are customer relationships, contracts and backlog and trade name and have estimated lives ranging from\n9\nto\n20\nyears (weighted average life of approximately\n12\nyears).\nF-46\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nFair value measurements relating to PA Consulting are made primarily using Level 3 inputs including discounted cash flow techniques. Fair value is estimated using inputs primarily from the income approach, which include the use of both the multiple period excess earnings method and the relief from royalties method. The significant assumptions used in estimating fair value include (i) revenue projections of the business, including profitability, (ii) attrition rate and (iii) the estimated discount rate that reflects the level of risk associated with receiving future cash flows. Other personal property assets, such as buildings, furniture, fixtures and equipment, are valued using the cost approach, which is based on estimates of replacement cost. Key inputs to the valuation of the noncontrolling interests include projected cash flows and the expected volatility associated with those cash flows.\nPre-tax transaction costs associated with the PA Consulting investment in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the year ended October 1, 2021 were $\n36.8\nmillion.\nThe following presents summarized unaudited pro forma operating results of Jacobs from continuing operations assuming that the Company had the PA Consulting investment at September 28, 2019.\nThese pro forma operating results are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not indicative of the operating results that would have been achieved had the related events occurred (in millions, except per share data):\nIncluded in the table above are charges relating to transaction expenses, a nonrecurring compensation charge and other items that are removed from the years ended October 1, 2021 and are reflected in the prior fiscal year due to the assumed timing of the transaction.

Subsequent to the closing date and during the current fiscal year, the Company recognized the $7.7 million as an offset to selling, general and administrative expense as it was no longer expected to be paid. In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company assumed the Buffalo Group's debt of approximately $\n7.7\nmillion. The Company repaid all of the assumed Buffalo Group debt by the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2021.\nThe following summarizes the fair values of The Buffalo Group's assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date (in millions):\nThe purchase price allocation is based upon preliminary information and is subject to change when additional information is obtained. Goodwill recognized results from a substantial assembled workforce, which does not qualify for separate recognition, as well as expected future synergies from combining operations.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nSummarized Financial Information of Discontinued Operations\nThe following table represents earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax (in thousands):\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company received final working capital settlement proceeds of $\n36.4\nmillion from Worley and as such, recorded a pre-tax gain of $\n15.6\nmillion. Offsetting the proceeds from the settlement to arrive at the net gain amount were previously recorded accounts receivable from Worley.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses includes a reduction for net insurance recoveries of approximately $\n40.0\nmillion for the year ended October 2, 2020 recorded in connection with the Nui Phao (\"NPMC\") legal matter described in Note 19-\nContractual Guarantees, Litigations, Investigations and Insurance\n. Additionally, the year ended September 27, 2019 includes a charge for the award and recovery of costs, estimated related interest and attorneys' fees related to the NPMC legal matter.\nFor the year ended October 2, 2020, the gain on sale of $\n110.2\nmillion relates mainly to the recognition of the deferred gain for the delayed transfer of the ECR-related assets and liabilities of the two international entities discussed below, adjustments for working capital and certain other items in connection with the ECR sale and additional income for the release of a deferred gain upon achievement of the IT Migration Date described below in connection with the delivery to Worley of certain IT application and hardware assets related to the ECR business.\nFor the year ended September 27, 2019, other expense (income), net was comprised of $\n35.0\nmillion in interest expense relating to the Nui Phao settlement, $\n6.0\nmillion in foreign currency revaluations, $\n9.6\nmillion in loss on the sale of a joint venture which is offset by $\n4.4\nmillion in miscellaneous income.\nGain on Sale and Deferred Gain\nAs a result of the ECR sale, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $\n1.1\nbillion, $\n935.1\nmillion of which was recognized in fiscal 2019, $\n110.2\nmillion for the year ended October 2, 2020 and $\n15.6\nmillion for the year ended October 1, 2021, respectively.\nUpon closing the ECR sale, the Company retained a noncontrolling interest (with significant influence) in P&PS-related activities in one international legal entity acquired by Worley. The fair value of the Company’s retained interest in the net assets and liabilities of this entity was estimated at $\n33.0\nmillion and recorded at closing. For another international legal entity, the closing and transfer of ECR-related assets to Worley were set to occur at a future date. At the time of the ECR sale, the Company allocated proceeds received to these deferred closing items on a relative fair value basis and recognized a deferred gain of $\n34.4\nmillion. During the second fiscal quarter of 2020, the delayed transfer of the ECR-related assets and liabilities of these two international entities occurred, and as a result, previously deferred gain amounts were recognized.\nIn addition to consideration received for the sale of the ECR business, the proceeds received included advanced consideration for the Company to deliver IT application and related hardware assets at a future date (“IT Migration Date”) to Worley upon completion of the interim transition services provided under the TSA, described further below. This\nF-55\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\ndeliverable of IT assets is considered to be a separate element of the ECR business sale transaction, and accordingly, we have allocated a portion of the proceeds received of $\n95.3\nmillion on a relative fair value basis to this separate deliverable and recognized deferred income. Upon completion and acceptance of this deliverable by Worley in December 2019, the deferred proceeds were recognized in earnings from discontinued operations, along with expenses associated with any costs incurred and deferred by the Company for this deliverable.\nInvestment in Worley Stock\nAs discussed above, the Company held\n58.2\nmillion in ordinary shares of Worley in connection with the ECR sale,\n6.8\nmillion shares of which were sold in fiscal 2019, netting a loss of $\n4.9\nmillion. The remaining Worley shares were sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, netting a realized loss of\n$\n155.1\nmillion\n. Dividend income, realized gains and losses on sale and unrealized gains and losses on changes in fair value of Worley shares are recognized in miscellaneous income (expense), net in continuing operations.\nThe Company's investment in Worley was measured at fair value through net income as it is an equity investment with a readily determinable fair value based on quoted market prices. The ordinary shares previously held were recorded within investment in equity securities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets at their estimated fair value, which was $\n347.5\nmillion as of October 2, 2020. For the years ended October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020, the Company recognized a gain of $\n40.7\nmillion and a loss of $\n103.6\nmillion, respectively, associated with share price and currency changes on this investment, as well as dividend income related to the equity investment in the amount of $\n19.1\nmillion and $\n16.9\nmillion, respectively. Quoted market prices were available for these securities in an active market and therefore categorized as a Level 1 input.\nTransition Services Agreement\nUpon closing of the ECR sale, the Company entered into a Transition Services Agreement (the \"TSA\") with Worley pursuant to which the Company, on an interim basis, provided various services to Worley including executive consultation, corporate, information technology, and project services. The initial term of the TSA began immediately following the closing of the ECR sale on April 26, 2019 and expired in April 2020, although the parties mutually agreed to extend certain of the services for additional time periods beyond the initial term. All services under the TSA were terminated in October 2020. Pursuant to the terms of the TSA, the Company received payments for the interim services which approximate costs incurred to perform the services. The Company has recognized costs recorded in SG&A expense incurred to perform the TSA, offset by $\n0.2\nmillion and $\n15.8\nmillion in TSA related income for such services that is reported in miscellaneous income (expense) in continuing operations for the year ended October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020, respectively, before inclusion of certain incremental outside service support costs agreed to be shared equally by the parties.\n17.\nRestructuring and Other Charges\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Company implemented certain restructuring and integration initiatives relating to the Buffalo Group acquisition and the PA Consulting investment. The activities of these initiatives have been substantially completed.\nAdditionally, the Company recorded impairment charges on its investment in AWE during fiscal 2021. See related discussion in Note 8-\nJoint ventures, VIEs and other investments\n.\nDuring fiscal 2020, the Company implemented certain restructuring and separation initiatives, including transformation initiatives relating to real estate and other staffing programs. The activities of these initiatives are expected to continue into fiscal 2023.\nDuring fiscal 2019 and continuing into fiscal 2020, the Company implemented certain restructuring and separation initiatives associated with the ECR sale, the KeyW acquisition, and other related cost reduction initiatives. Additionally, in fiscal 2020, the Company implemented certain restructuring and separation initiatives associated with the acquisition of John Wood Group's nuclear business. The restructuring activities and related costs were comprised mainly of separation and lease abandonment and sublease programs, while the separation activities and costs were mainly related to the engagement of consulting services and internal personnel and other related costs dedicated to the Company’s ECR-business separation. The activities of these initiatives have been substantially completed.\nDuring the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017, the Company implemented certain restructuring and pre-integration plans associated with the then-pending acquisition of CH2M Hill Companies, Ltd. (\"CH2M\"), an international provider of engineering, construction and technical services (the \"CH2M acquisition\"), which closed on December 15, 2017. The\nF-56\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nrestructuring activities and related costs under these plans were comprised mainly of severance and lease abandonment programs, while the integration activities and costs were mainly related to the engagement of professional services and internal personnel and other related costs dedicated to the Company’s integration management efforts. Following the closing of the CH2M acquisition, these activities have continued through fiscal 2021 and are expected to be substantially completed before the end of fiscal 2022.\nCollectively, the above-mentioned restructuring activities are referred to as “Restructuring and other charges”.\nThe following table summarizes the impacts of the Restructuring and other charges by operating segment in connection with the CH2M, KeyW, John Wood Group nuclear business and Buffalo Group acquisitions and the PA Consulting investment, the ECR sale and the Company's transformation initiatives relating to real estate and other staffing programs for the year ended October 1, 2021, the CH2M and KeyW, John Wood Group nuclear business acquisitions, the ECR sale and the Company's transformation initiatives relating to real estate and other staffing programs for the year ended October 2, 2020 and the CH2M and KeyW acquisitions and the ECR sale for the year ended September 27, 2019 (in thousands):\n(1)\nFor the years ended October 1, 2021, October 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019, amounts include$\n61.0\nmillion, $\n321.6\nmillion and $\n337.0\nmillion, respectively, in items impacting operating profit, along with items recorded in other income (expense), net, which includes a $(\n38.5\n) million charge related to the impairment of our AWE Management Ltd. investment for the year ended October 1, 2021, the loss on settlement of the CH2M portion of the U.S. pension plan of $(\n2.1\n) million for the year ended October 2, 2020 and the gain on the settlement of the CH2M retiree medical plans of $\n35.0\nmillion for the year ended September 27, 2019, along with the write-off of fixed assets related to restructured leases of $(\n10.0\n) million for the year ended September 27, 2019.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nCumulative amounts since 2017 incurred to date under our various restructuring and other activities described above by each major type of cost as of October 1, 2021 are as follows (in thousands):\n18.\nCommitments and Contingencies and Derivative Financial Instruments\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk under its variable rate borrowings and additionally, due to the nature of the Compan\ny's international operations, we are at times exposed to foreign currency risk. As such, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts and interest rate contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies and interest rates.\nIn fiscal 2020 we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a notional va\nlue of $\n796.1\nmillion as of October 1, 2021 to manage the interest rate exposure on our variable rate loans. Additionally, we entered into a cross-currency swap agreement with a notional value of $\n127.8\nmillion to manage the interest rate and\nforeign currency exposure on our USD borrowings by a European subsidiary. By entering into the swap agreements, the Company converted the LIBOR rate based liability into a fixed rate liability and, for the cross currency swap, our LIBOR rate based borrowing in USD to a fixed rate Euro liability, for periods ranging from three and a half to\nten years\n. Under the interest rate swap agreements, the Company receives the one month LIBOR rate and pays monthly a fixed rate ranging from\n.704\n% to\n1.116\n%, and under the cross currency swap agreement, the Company receives the one month LIBOR rate plus\n0.875\n% in USD and pays monthly a Euro fixed rate of\n.726\n% to\n.746\n% for the term of the swaps. The swaps were designated as cash-flow hedges in accordance with ASC 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n. The fair value of the interest rate and cross currency swaps at October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020 was $(\n0.8\n) million and\n$(\n31.5\n) million\n, respectively, of which\n$(\n11.0\n) million\nis included in other deferred liabilities and\n$\n10.2\nmillion\nis included in miscellaneous other assets on the consolidated balance sheets at\nOctober 1, 2021\n. The entire amount was included in other deferred liabilities at\nOctober 2, 2020.\nThe unrealized net gain (loss) on these interest rate and cross currency swaps was\n$\n7.4\nmillion\nand\n$(\n14.6\n) million\n, net of tax, and was included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of October 1, 2021 and\nOctober 2, 2020, respectively\n.\nAdditionally, at October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020, the Company held foreign exchange forward contracts in currencies that support our operations, including British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and other currencies, with notional values of $\n506.5\nmillion and $\n393.7\nmillion at October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020, respectively. The length of these contracts currently ranges from\none\nto\ntwelve months\n. The fair value of the foreign exchange contracts at October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020 was $\n55.5\nmillion and $\n53.5\nmillion, respectively, which is included in current assets within receivables and contract assets on the consolidated balance sheet and with associated income statement impacts included in miscellaneous income (expense) in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nThe fair value measurements of these derivatives are being made using Level 2 inputs under ASC 820,\nFair Value Measurement\n, as the measurements are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets. We are exposed to risk from credit-related losses resulting from nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instruments. We perform credit evaluations of our counterparties under forward exchange and interest rate contracts and expect all counterparties to meet their obligations. We have not experienced credit losses from our counterparties.\nLetters of Credit\nAt October 1, 2021, the Company had issued and outstanding approximately $\n263.8\nmillion in LOCs and $\n2.1\nbillion in surety bonds. Of the outstanding LOC amount, $\n1.7\nmillion has been issued under the Revolving Credit Facility and $\n262.1\nmillion are issued under separate, committed and uncommitted letter-of-credit facilities.\nF-58\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n19.\nContractual Guarantees, Litigation, Investigations and Insurance\nIn the normal course of business, we make contractual commitments (some of which are supported by separate guarantees) and on occasion we are a party in a litigation or arbitration proceeding. The litigation or arbitration in which we are involved primarily includes personal injury claims, professional liability claims and breach of contract claims. Where we provide a separate guarantee it is strictly in support of the underlying contractual commitment. Guarantees take various forms including surety bonds required by law, or standby letters of credit (\"LOC\" and also referred to as “bank guarantees”) or corporate guarantees given to induce a party to enter into a contract with a subsidiary. Standby LOCs are also used as security for advance payments or in various other transactions. The guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from an arbitrary date to completion of our work (e.g., engineering only) to completion of the overall project. See Note 18-\nCommitments and Contingencies and Derivative Financial Instruments\nfor more information surrounding LOCs and surety bonds.\nWe maintain insurance coverage for most insurable aspects of our business and operations. Our insurance programs have varying coverage limits depending upon the type of insurance, and include certain conditions and exclusions which insurance companies may raise in response to any claim that is asserted by or against the Company. We have also elected to retain a portion of losses and liabilities that occur through the use of various deductibles, limits, and retentions under our insurance programs. As a result, we may be subject to a future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured. We intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of the contracts which the Company enters with its clients. Our insurers are also subject to business risk and, as a result, one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise.\nAdditionally, as a contractor providing services to the U.S. federal government we are subject to many types of audits, investigations and claims by, or on behalf of, the government including with respect to contract performance, pricing, cost allocations, procurement practices, labor practices and socioeconomic obligations. Furthermore, our income, franchise and similar tax returns and filings are also subject to audit and investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, most states within the United States, as well as by various government agencies representing jurisdictions outside the United States.\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheets include amounts representing our probable estimated liability relating to such claims, guarantees, litigation, audits and investigations. We perform an analysis to determine the level of reserves to establish for insurance-related claims that are known and have been asserted against us, as well as for insurance-related claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis, but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates. We include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations. Insurance recoveries are recorded as assets if recovery is probable and estimated liabilities are not reduced by expected insurance recoveries.\nThe Company believes, after consultation with counsel, that such guarantees, litigation, U.S. government contract-related audits, investigations and claims and income tax audits and investigations should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements, beyond amounts currently accrued.\nIn 2012, CH2M HILL Australia PTY Limited, a subsidiary of CH2M, entered into a 50/50 integrated joint venture with Australian construction contractor UGL Infrastructure Pty Limited. The joint venture entered into a Consortium Agreement with General Electric and GE Electrical International Inc. The Consortium was awarded a subcontract by JKC Australia LNG Pty Limited (\"JKC\") for the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of a\n360\nMW Combined Cycle Power Plant for INPEX Operations Australia Pty Limited at Blaydin Point, Darwin, NT, Australia. In January 2017, the Consortium terminated the Subcontract because of JKC’s repudiatory breach and demobilized from the work site. JKC claimed the Consortium abandoned the work and itself purported to terminate the Subcontract. The Consortium and JKC are now in dispute over the termination. In August 2017, the Consortium filed an International Chamber of Commerce arbitration against JKC and is seeking compensatory damages in the amount of approximately $\n530.0\nmillion for repudiatory breach or, in the alternative, seeking damages for unresolved contract claims and change orders. JKC is seeking damages in excess of $\n1.7\nbillion and has drawn on the bonds. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, a November 2020 date for commencement of the hearing was vacated and the hearing was rescheduled for opening arguments in April 2021 and the remaining proceedings in July and August 2021. The opening arguments did occur as scheduled, but in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the remaining proceedings were rescheduled to now occur in April and May 2022. It is anticipated that closing arguments will be made in July 2022. Although an earlier decision is possible, no decision is expected before the end of 2022 or 2023. In September 2018, JKC filed a declaratory judgment action in Western Australia alleging that the entities which executed parent company guaranties for the Consortium, including CH2M Hill\nF-59\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nCompanies, Ltd., have an obligation to pay JKC’s ongoing costs to complete the project after termination. A hearing on that matter was held in March 2019, and a decision in favor of the Consortium was issued. JKC appealed the decision, a hearing on the appeal took place in March 2020 and a decision was handed down on July 22, 2020 denying JKC’s appeal in its entirety. The Consortium has denied liability and is vigorously defending JKC's claims and pursuing its affirmative claims against JKC. Based on the information currently available, the Company does not expect the resolution of this matter to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, in excess of the current reserve for this matter. For further information on CH2M contingencies, refer to Note 15-\nOther Business Combinations.\nOn December 22, 2008, a coal fly ash pond at the Kingston Power Plant of the Tennessee Valley Authority (\"TVA\") was breached, releasing fly ash waste into the Emory River and surrounding community. In February 2009, TVA awarded a contract to the Company to provide project management services associated with the clean-up. All remediation and dredging were completed in August 2013 by other contractors under direct contracts with TVA. The Company did not perform the remediation, and its scope was limited to program management services. Certain employees of the contractors performing the cleanup work on the project filed lawsuits against the Company beginning in August 2013, alleging they were injured due to the Company's failure to protect the plaintiffs from exposure to fly ash, and asserting related personal injuries. The primary case, Greg Adkisson, et al. v. Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., case No. 3:13-CV-505-TAV-HBG, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, consists of\n10\nconsolidated cases. This case and the related cases involve several hundred plaintiffs that were employees of the contractors that completed the remediation and dredging work. The cases are at various stages of litigation, and several of the cases are currently stayed pending resolution of other cases. Additionally, in May 2019, Roane County and the cities of Kingston and Harriman filed a lawsuit against TVA and the Company alleging that they misled the public about risks associated with the released fly ash. In October 2020, the Court granted Jacobs and TVA’s motion to dismiss the Roane County litigation and closed the case. In addition, in November 2019, a resident of Roane County, Margie Delozier, filed a putative class action against TVA and the Company alleging they failed to adequately warn local residents about risks associated with the released fly ash. The Company and TVA filed separate motions to dismiss the Delozier case in April 2020. In February 2021, the Court granted dismissal of the Delozier Complaint with prejudice, with the exception of plaintiff's’ nuisance cause of action, which plaintiff voluntarily dismissed in July 2021. Finally, in August 2021, Thomas Ryan, a resident of Roane County, filed an action against Jacobs and TVA claiming personal injury and property damage. Separately\n,\nin February 2020, the Company learned that the district attorney in Roane County recommended that the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation investigate issues pertaining to clean up worker safety at Kingston. On November 15, 2021, the Roane County district attorney announced that it had concluded its investigation into issues pertaining to the Kingston coal ash spill cleanup. There has been no finding of liability against the Company or that any of the alleged illnesses are the result of exposure to fly ash in any of the above matters. The Company disputes the allegations asserted in all of the above matters and is vigorously defending these matters. The Company does not expect the resolution of these matters to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOn October 31, 2019, the Company received a request from the Enforcement Division of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") for the production of certain information and documents. The information and documents sought by the SEC primarily relate to the operations of a joint venture in Morocco, which was at one time partially-owned by the Company (and subsequently divested), including in respect of possible corrupt practices. The Company is fully cooperating with the SEC and is continuing to produce information and documents in its possession in response to subsequent requests by the SEC. The Company does not expect the resolution of this matter to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n20.\nSegment Information\nThe Company's\nthree\noperating segments are comprised of its\ntwo\nglobal lines of business (\"LOBs\"): Critical Mission Solutions (\"CMS\") and People & Places Solutions (\"P&PS\") and its majority investment in PA Consulting. For further information on the PA Consulting investment, refer to Note 14-\nPA Consulting Business Combination\n.\nThe Company’s Chair and Chief Executive Officer is the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and can evaluate the performance of each of these segments and make appropriate resource allocations among each of the segments. For purposes of the Company’s goodwill impairment testing, it has been determined that the Company’s operating segments are also its reporting units based on management’s conclusion that the components comprising each of its operating segments share similar economic characteristics and meet the aggregation criteria for reporting units in accordance with ASC 350,\nIntangibles-Goodwill and Other\n.\nF-60\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nUnder this organization, the sales function is managed by LOB and PA Consulting, and accordingly, the associated cost is embedded in the segments and reported to the respective head of each segment. In addition, a portion of the costs of other support functions (e.g., finance, legal, human resources, and information technology) is allocated to each LOB using methodologies which, we believe, effectively attribute the cost of these support functions to the revenue generating activities of the Company on a rational basis. The cost of the Company’s cash incentive plan, the Leadership Performance Plan (\"LPP\"), formerly named the Management Incentive Plan, and the expense associated with the Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (“1999 SIP”) have likewise been charged to the LOBs except for those amounts determined to relate to the business as a whole (which amounts remain in other corporate expenses).\nFinancial information for each segment is reviewed by the CODM to assess performance and make decisions regarding the allocation of resources. The Company generally does not track assets by LOB, nor does it provide such information to the CODM.\nThe CODM evaluates the operating performance of our operating segments using segment operating profit, which is defined as margin less “corporate charges” (e.g., the allocated amounts described above). The Company incurs certain Selling, General and Administrative costs (“SG&A”) that relate to its business as a whole which are not allocated to the segments.\nThe following tables present total revenues and segment operating profit for each reportable segment (in thousands) and includes a reconciliation of segment operating profit to total U.S. GAAP operating profit by including certain corporate-level expenses and expenses relating to the restructuring and other charges (as defined in Note 17\n-Restructuring and Other Charges\n) and transaction costs (in thousands).\n(1)\nIncludes $\n19.5\nmillion, net, in charges related to a legal settlement for the year ended October 1, 2021 and $\n25.0\nmillion in charges associated with a certain project for the year ended September 27, 2019.\n(2)\nOther corporate expenses include intangibles amortization of\n$\n149.8\nmillion\n, $\n90.6\nmillion and $\n79.1\nmillion for the years ended October 1, 2021\n,\nOctober 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019, respectively. Also includes costs that were previously allocated to the ECR segment prior to discontinued operations presentation in connection with the ECR sale in the approximate amount of $\n14.8\nmillion for the year ended September 27, 2019.\n(3)\nIncluded in the year ended October 1, 2021 is\n$\n297.8\nmillion\nof costs incurred in connection with the investment in PA Consulting, in part classified as compensation costs.\n(4)\nThe years ended October 1, 2021, October 2, 2020 and September 27, 2019 include $\n34.7\nmillion\n, $(\n74.3\n) million and $(\n64.8\n) million in fair value adjustments related to our investment in Worley stock (net of Worley stock div\nidends) (sold during the current year) and certain foreign currency r\nevaluations relating to ECR sale proceeds, respectively and revenues\nF-61\nJACOBS ENGINEERING GROUP INC.

Such costs and expenses include: (i) those elements of SG&A expenses relating to the business as a whole; (ii) those elements of our incentive compensation plans relating to corporate personnel whose other compensation costs are not allocated to the LOBs; (iii) the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations; (iv) the quarterly variances between the Company’s actual costs of certain of its self-insured integrated risk and employee benefit programs and amounts charged to the LOBs; and (v) certain adjustments relating to costs associated with the Company’s international defined benefit pension plans. In addition, other corporate expenses may also include from time to time certain adjustments to contract margins (both positive and negative) associated with projects where it has been determined, in the opinion of management, that such adjustments are not indicative of the performance of the related LOB.\nF-62\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended October 1, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at October 1, 2021 and October 2, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended October 1, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control\n—\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated November 23, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in the 2020 financial statements to reflect the accounting method change due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) and the related amendments.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nF-66\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nDallas, Texas\nNovember 23, 2021\nF-67"
