    "text": "We are a global technology leader focused on developing intelligent solutions that allow customers to capture, analyze and act upon data seamlessly from edge to cloud. We enable customers to accelerate business outcomes by driving new business models, creating new customer and employee experiences, and increasing operational efficiency today and into the future. Our customers range from small-and-medium-sized businesses (\"SMBs\") to large global enterprises and governmental entities. Our legacy dates back to a partnership founded in 1939 by William R. Hewlett and David Packard, and we strive every day to uphold and enhance that legacy through our dedication to providing innovative technological solutions to our customers.\nOn November 1, 2015, HP Inc. (\"former Parent\"), formerly known as Hewlett-Packard Company (\"HP Co.\") spun-off  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (\"we\", \"us\", \"our\", \"Hewlett Packard Enterprise\", \"HPE\", or \"the Company\") pursuant to a separation agreement (the \"Separation and Distribution Agreement\") (collectively the \"Separation\"). Since the Separation, we have operated as an independent, publicly-traded company.\nOn April 1, 2017, the Company completed the separation and merger of our Enterprise Services business with DXC Technology Company (\"DXC\", \"the Everett Transaction\" or \"Everett\").\nOn September 1, 2017, the Company completed the separation and merger of our Software business segment with Micro Focus International plc (\"Micro Focus\", \"the Seattle Transaction\" or \"Seattle\" ).\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Update\nWhile great progress has been made in the fight against the novel coronavirus pandemic (\"COVID-19\" or \"pandemic\"), it remains a global challenge. In fiscal 2021, due to an unprecedented demand for electronic devices and related industry-wide supply constraints, the global economy encountered a challenging supply chain environment. The pandemic continues to have an impact on our financial performance and we are currently unable to predict the extent to which it may adversely impact our future business operations, financial performance and results of operations. For a further discussion of the risks, uncertainties and actions taken in response to COVID-19, see risks identified in the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A.\nIn 2021, COVID-19 vaccines were broadly distributed and administered, and beginning October 4, 2021, we adopted a policy to require proof of vaccination from HPE personnel, contingent workers, and guests in order to return to our sites, where permitted by local laws and regulations and on the timeline determined appropriate for the geography (as of end of fiscal 2021, the policy was operationalized only in the U.S.). On October 20, 2021, we updated our vaccination policy to require vaccination as a condition of employment for all HPE personnel covered by President Biden's executive order, effective January 18, 2022. We recognize that there are existing legal challenges to the executive order, and we will ensure that the timing and scope of the implementation of our vaccination requirement is consistent with the legal status of the executive order. We are committed to help support costs for the vaccine through HPE health benefits or other programs, to the extent not covered by government programs, medical plans or other sources.\nOur Strategy\nThe pace of technology disruption continues to increase, and the pandemic has accelerated several megatrends. First, data at the edge is increasing exponentially, driven by the proliferation of devices. Secure connectivity is essential to enable the digital experiences we now rely on – and power new, engaging digital experiences in the future. Second, enterprises need a cloud experience everywhere to manage data and workloads wherever they live across a distributed enterprise. Third, data growth is creating countless new opportunities. Enterprises need ways to generate insights from this data to build new business models. Across these trends is the shift in how enterprises are consuming their technology. Increasingly, customers want to digitally transform while preserving capital and eliminating operating expense by paying only for the IT they use.\nData insights are critical to deliver business outcomes, but extracting value from data is challenging. Data is growing and evolving rapidly. Its characteristics are shifting, as it becomes more unstructured, more time-sensitive and more distributed.  Frequently, data is siloed and spread across different multi-gen IT systems, often trapped in critical legacy architecture. Many organizations cannot adequately extract insights from their data at the edge or face cloud migration challenges because of their legacy applications. Customers need a data-first modernization approach across edge to data center to cloud.\nWe declared our vision to be the edge-to-cloud company. Our HPE GreenLake platform accelerates multi-generation IT transformation through a unified cloud services experience that enables customers to access, control and maximize the value of all their workloads and data. Our solutions across connectivity, cloud and data – which are increasingly being delivered as-a-service through HPE GreenLake – are complemented by HPE Pointnext services that provide unique transformation capabilities, as well as HPE Financial Services, which helps customers unlock financial capacity.\n2\nHuman Capital Resources\nAt HPE we are united by our purpose, which is to advance the way people live and work. We believe technology’s greatest promise lies in its potential for positive change. This is the guidepost for each decision we make at HPE. We believe it not only helps guide our contribution to society, but also makes good business sense. Our company has always been an engine of innovation, and our approximately 60,400 employees as of October 31, 2021, are proud of the ways our technology enables our customers to achieve meaningful outcomes like curing disease, modernizing farming to cure world-hunger and democratizing transportation through autonomous vehicles.\nOur Culture\n:\nWe recognize the critical importance of talent and culture to the success of HPE and our ability to fulfill our purpose. We are passionate about the values that drive our success, which is why we believe in investing in our employees and in the communities where we live and work. HPE has intensified its focus on embedding these values into a vibrant culture that creates a superior team member experience and a highly engaged workforce, driving improvements across our communications,  our reward programs, and our work environment. Through such efforts, we are fostering a collaborative, inclusive and inspiring experience for all our team members. Our most recent global engagement survey shows how these intentional efforts are making a difference, with our overall Employee Engagement Index increasing year-over-year and measuring 84%. More than 85% of team members would recommend HPE as a great place to work, and 89% say they are proud to work for HPE.\nBuilding a Vibrant Culture: We have identified four key cultural beliefs that guide how we lead on a daily basis: belief in accelerating what’s next, in bold moves, in the “power of yes we can”, and in being a force for good. We embed these beliefs in a deep-rooted DNA that puts customers first, enabling us to partner, innovate and act with integrity. Our empowered and engaging culture is making HPE a destination for talent while driving innovation and excellence for our customers.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion: We are committed to being unconditionally inclusive to capture the ideas and perspectives that fuel innovation and enable our workforce, customers, and communities to succeed in the digital age. This is because, by harnessing the potential of our technologies and our team members, we can be a force for good. Annual goals are set to increase the representation of both women and ethnically diverse talent by at least 1 percentage point year-over-year. At the close of fiscal 2021, the representation of women in our workforce had increased 1 percentage point since the prior year, with increased representation at every level worldwide, exceeding the goals in both technical and executive roles. We also increased our representation of all underrepresented minorities in the U.S., increasing such representation by 1.6 percentage points overall. The leadership standards clearly articulate that all people leaders are expected to continuously develop their inclusive leadership capabilities. Our Board, CEO and Executive Committee role model high standards for diversity, equity and inclusion and are leading sustainable change, with strong governance and oversight via our Inclusion and Diversity Council.\nTalent: We invest in attracting, developing and retaining the best talent. We do this by communicating a clear purpose and strategy, transparent goal setting, driving accountability, continuously assessing, developing, advancing talent, and a leadership-driven talent strategy. The dynamism of our industry and our company enables team members to grow in their current roles and build new skills. Over the past year, our approximately 60,400 team members completed over 455,000 online and instructor-led courses across a broad range of categories – leadership, inclusion and diversity, professional skills, technical and compliance. HPE is deeply committed to identifying and developing the next generation of top tier leadership with a special focus on diverse and technical talent. We conduct an in-depth annual talent and succession review with our CEO and Executive Committee members. The process focuses on accelerating talent development, strengthening succession pipelines, and advancing diversity representation for our most critical roles.\nWork That Fits Your Life:\nThis global initiative, which was launched in 2019, is an important example of how HPE is investing in our culture and creating a team member experience that makes HPE a destination of choice for the best talent in the industry. It includes an industry-leading paid parental leave program (minimum 6 months), part-time work opportunities for new parents or team members transitioning to retirement, and \"Wellness Fridays\" encouraging team members to leave work early one Friday per month to focus on their well-being. HPE's broader wellness program offers flexibility built around team member needs while continuing to deliver on critical business results. Key features include mental health support including employee assistance programs and free headspace accounts, physical fitness activities, and financial wellness programs.\nTotal Rewards: HPE requires a uniquely talented workforce and is committed to providing total rewards that are market-competitive and performance based, driving innovation and operational excellence.  Our compensation programs, practices, and policies reflect our commitment to reward short- and long-term performance that aligns with, and drives, stockholder value.  Total direct compensation is generally positioned within a competitive range of the market median, with differentiation based on tenure, skills, proficiency, and performance to attract and retain key talent.\n3\nHPE’s strong and healthy culture is critical to accelerating what’s next for our customers and partners – and the success of our company. Our team is energized and more engaged than ever and will enable our ability to pivot and grow, which will, in turn, power the next chapter at Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\nOur Business Segments, Products and Services\nIn October 2021, we renamed the segment previously known as High Performance Computing and Mission Critical Solutions (\"HPC & MCS\") to High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence (\"HPC & AI\").\nOur operations are organized into six business segments: Compute, HPC & AI, Storage, Intelligent Edge, Financial Services (\"FS\"), and Corporate Investments and Other. The class of similar product categories within each segment which accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue in each of the past three years were as follows:\n•\nFiscal 2021 -  Compute products, Compute services, Storage products\n•\nFiscal 2020 -  Compute products, Storage products, Compute services\n•\nFiscal 2019 -  Compute products, Storage products\nA summary of our net revenue, earnings from operations and assets for our segments can be found in Note 2, \"Segment Information\", to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. A discussion of certain factors potentially affecting our operations is set forth in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"\nCompute\nOur Compute portfolio offers both general purpose servers for multi-workload computing and workload-optimized servers which offer the best performance and value for demanding applications. This portfolio of products includes our secure and versatile HPE ProLiant rack and tower servers; and HPE Synergy, a composable infrastructure for traditional and cloud-native applications. HPE ProLiant servers are the compute foundation for the fastest growing workloads in the industry including hyperconverged infrastructure (\"HCI\"), virtual workspaces (\"VDI\"), data management, transcoding and visualization. Compute offerings also include operational and support services. HPE GreenLake for Compute provides flexible Compute as-a-service (\"aaS\") IT infrastructure on a consumption basis.\nHPC & AI\nOur HPC & AI business offers standard and custom hardware and software solutions designed to support specific use cases.

The Edge Compute product portfolio includes HPE Edgeline products for computing at the network edge. In connection with our hardware offerings, HPE offers a suite of software products, including AI-powered technologies designed to play a critical role in turning data into readily available, actionable information to fuel growth and innovation for our customers. These include the recently acquired Determined AI, which provides a software stack to train AI models using its open source machine learning platform.\nHPC & AI offerings also include operational and support services and solutions delivered as-a-service through HPE GreenLake cloud services, which is a flexible as-a-service platform that HPE can provide on-premises or in a colocation facility. With offerings that are artificial intelligence-driven and built for hybrid cloud environments with GreenLake consumption models, we provide the right workload optimized destinations for data.\nA portion of HPC & AI revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to the terms and rights for the convenience of the government entity. These terms and rights include in some instances a dependence on the appropriation of future funding and also termination rights contingent upon not achieving certain milestones\n. For a discussion of certain risks related to contracts with government entities, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Failure to comply with government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations\".\nStorage\nHPE Storage is transforming the customer experience with storage as-a-service and cloud data services through the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform and data infrastructure to enable customers to simplify IT and unlock greater levels of agility with a cloud operational experience. The customer experience transformation also includes AI and data-driven intelligence with\n4\nHPE InfoSight and HPE CloudPhysics. Customers can store and serve their data with speed and high availability to applications, secure and protect their data across hybrid clouds from ransomware and cyber threats, and gain data mobility across private cloud, public cloud, and multi-cloud environments.\nThe Storage portfolio includes primary storage with HPE Alletra that offers cloud-native data infrastructure, HPE Primera, HPE Nimble Storage and HPE 3PAR; software-powered hyper-converged infrastructure consisting of HPE Nimble Storage dHCI and HPE SimpliVity; disaster recovery and ransomware recovery with Zerto, our recent acquisition; backup as-a-service with HPE Backup and Recovery Service, and big data solutions running on HPE Apollo servers. Storage also provides solutions for secondary workloads and traditional tape, storage networking and disk products, such as HPE Modular Storage Arrays (\"MSA\") and HPE XP. We make our data infrastructure portfolio available as-a-service through HPE GreenLake. Storage offerings also include operational and support services, software subscription services, and solutions delivered as-a-service through HPE GreenLake.\nIntelligent Edge\nThe Intelligent Edge business is comprised of a portfolio of\nsecure\nedge-to-cloud solutions operating under the Aruba brand that include wired and wireless local area network (\"LAN\"), campus and data center switching, software-defined wide area networking (from the Silver Peak acquisition), network security, and associated services to enable secure connectivity for businesses of any size. The primary business drivers for Intelligent Edge solutions are work from anywhere environments, mobility, and internet-of-things (\"IoT\"). The insights from data generated at the edge are key to driving new business outcomes and experiences.\nThe HPE Aruba Product portfolio includes wired and wireless local area network hardware products such as Wi-Fi access points, switches, routers and sensors. The HPE Aruba software and services portfolio includes cloud-based management, network management, network access control, analytics and assurance, location services software, and professional and support services, as well as as-a-service and consumption models through HPE GreenLake for the Intelligent Edge portfolio of products.\nWe also offer Aruba ESP (Edge Services Platform), which takes a cloud-native approach to helping customers meet their connectivity, security, and financial requirements across campus, branch, data center, and remote worker environments, covering all aspects of wired, wireless LAN, and wide area networking (\"WAN\").\nFinancial Services\nFinancial Services (\"FS\") provides flexible investment solutions, such as leasing, financing, IT consumption, and utility programs and asset management services, for customers that facilitate unique technology deployment models and the acquisition of complete IT solutions, including hardware, software and services from Hewlett Packard Enterprise and others. FS also supports financial solutions for on-premise flexible consumption models, such as HPE GreenLake. In order to provide flexible services and capabilities that support the entire IT life cycle, FS partners with customers globally to help build investment strategies that enhance their business agility and support their business transformation. FS offers a wide selection of investment solution capabilities for large enterprise customers and channel partners, along with an array of financial options to SMBs and educational and governmental entities.\nCorporate Investments and Other\nCorporate Investments and Other includes the Advisory and Professional Services (\"A & PS\") business which primarily offers consultative-led services, HPE and partner technology expertise and advice, implementation services as well as complex solution engagement capabilities; the Communications and Media Solutions (\"CMS\") business which primarily offers software and related services to the telecommunications industry; the Software business which offers HPE Ezmeral Container Platform and HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric; and Hewlett Packard Labs which is responsible for research and development.\nOur Strengths\nWe believe that we possess a number of competitive advantages that distinguish us from our competitors, including:\n•\nEdge-to-cloud strategy and solutions uniquely solve customer challenges.\nAs data grows and evolves and enterprises become increasingly distributed, HPE’s edge-to-cloud strategy is uniquely designed to enable customers to securely access, control and maximize the value of all their workloads and data assets to accelerate business outcomes. The HPE GreenLake platform is an open, secure, fully integrated platform that brings a unified experience across the edge, data center, colocation and cloud. It is automated and easy to consume with capacity available to scale up and down on demand.  It offers true pay per use consumption so customers only pay for what they use, and they can have the entire hybrid cloud experience managed for them through our HPE GreenLake managed services offering.\n5\n•\nComprehensive portfolio.\nWe have a distinctive and industry leading portfolio of edge-to-cloud solutions and unique capabilities to help accelerate our customers' digital transformations. We combine our software-defined infrastructure and services capabilities to provide what we believe is the strongest portfolio of enterprise solutions in the IT industry. Our ability to deliver a comprehensive IT strategy and connect our customers' data from edge to cloud, through our high-quality products and high-value consulting and support services in a single package, is one of our principal differentiators.\n•\nDifferentiated consumption-based IT solutions for a growing opportunity.\nEnterprises of all sizes are looking to digitally transform in order to develop next-generation cloud-native applications, create actionable insights from their data, and drive business growth, but they face many challenges including lack of in-house IT skills, limited budgets and options for financing, and lack of flexibility to choose the technology foundation that best meets their needs. Consumption-based IT offers solutions to these challenges by providing greater agility, empowering people to shift from managing infrastructure to driving innovation by leveraging insights from their data, while eliminating capital and operating expenses tied to infrastructure over-provisioning. HPE is distinctly differentiated in delivering a true consumption-based IT experience.\n•\nMulti-year innovation roadmap and strong balance sheet.\nWe have been in the technology and innovation business for over 80 years. Our vast intellectual property portfolio and global research and development capabilities are part of a broader innovation roadmap designed to help organizations take advantage of the expanding amount of data available and leverage the latest technology developments like cloud, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity to drive business outcomes now and in the future. We also have a strong balance sheet and liquidity profile that provides the financial flexibility and speed to take advantage of acquisition opportunities.\n•\nGlobal distribution and partner ecosystem.\nWe are experts in delivering innovative technological solutions to our customers in complex multi-country, multi-vendor and/or multi-language environments. We have one of the largest go-to-market capabilities in our industry, including a large ecosystem of channel partners, which enables us to market and deliver our product offerings to customers located virtually anywhere in the world.\n•\nCustom financial solutions.\nThrough Financial Services we can help customers create investment capacity to accelerate their transformations by helping them free up capital, capture value from older assets, achieve sustainability goals, invest in new technologies as-a-service, and weather financial volatility. Financial Services is also an enabler of our consumption-based IT models by helping spread our upfront solution costs over the duration of the customer contract. Through Financial Services' Global Asset Recovery Centers, we are helping customers achieve their own sustainability goals by recovering over 3 million IT assets in fiscal 2020 and refurbishing close to 90% for reuse.\n•\nExperienced leadership team.\nOur management team has an extensive track record of performance and execution. We are led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Antonio Neri, who has proven experience in developing transformative business models, building global brands and driving sustained growth and expansion in the technology industry. Mr. Neri's experience includes over 20 years combined at HPE and HP Co. in various leadership positions. Our senior management team has many years of experience in our industry and possesses extensive knowledge of and experience in the enterprise IT business and the markets in which we compete.\n•\nOpen platforms.\nThe world is shifting from centralized and closed approaches in large data centers to a future of centers of data everywhere which are highly decentralized and distributed. This shift demands a common cloud platform that can put the agility and intelligence close to the customers data sources to create real-time insights, everywhere. Many of our competitors want to lock customers into a cloud stack. Conversely, we believe that the cloud experience should be open and seamless across all our customers' clouds — and the best cloud transformation partner is one who is unbiased and offers choice. We are unique in our ability to enable any hybrid cloud strategy and a consistent experience that is open to any cloud and differentiated with our partner integrations.\nSales, Marketing and Distribution\nWe manage our business and report our financial results based on the segments described above. Our customers are organized by commercial and large enterprise groups, including business and public sector enterprises, and purchases of our products, solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by us or indirectly through a variety of partners, including:\n•\nresellers that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or services, to targeted customer groups;\n•\ndistribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers;\n•\noriginal equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") that integrate our products and services with their own products and services, and sell the integrated solution;\n•\nindependent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products;\n6\n•\nsystems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom IT solutions and often partner with us to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services; and\n•\nadvisory firms that provide various levels of management and IT consulting, including some systems integration work, and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and services.\nThe mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region. We believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions require us to tailor our sales, marketing and distribution efforts accordingly. We are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage, in addition to identifying efficiencies and productivity gains, in both our direct and indirect businesses. This has resulted in a combined go-to-market model, in which we have a direct sales presence in a number of countries, while we sell and deliver our products, solutions and services through a channel-only model in the remaining countries. In those countries where we have a direct sales presence, we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers as well as with large public sector accounts. The account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise. For other customers, our businesses collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting smaller accounts, both in the commercial and public sector space.\nManufacturing and Materials\nWe utilize a significant number of outsourced and contract manufacturers around the world to manufacture products that we design. The use of outsourced and contract manufacturers is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for our products as well as create manufacturing flexibility in our supply chain and processes. In some circumstances, third-party OEMs produce products that we purchase and resell under our brand. In addition to our use of outsourced and contract manufacturers, we currently manufacture a limited number of finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors.\nHistorically, we have utilized two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order and configuring products to order. We build products to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Alternatively, configuring products to order enables units to match a customer's particular hardware and software customization requirements. Our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers.\nWe purchase materials, supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate sources of supply are readily available. However, we do rely on single-source suppliers for certain customized parts (although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption) and a disruption or loss of a single-source supplier could delay production of some products. In some instances, our single-source suppliers (e.g. Intel and AMD as suppliers of certain x86 processors) are also the single-source suppliers for the entire market; disruptions with these suppliers would result in industry-wide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors.\nLike other participants in the IT industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days. From time to time, we experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources due to certain events taking place where our suppliers are geographically concentrated. When necessary, we are often able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market, which may have an impact on our gross margin, but does not generally disrupt production. We also acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints, or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price and availability of supply. See \"Risk Factors—We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our supplier relationships properly\" in Item 1A.\nAs a result of the pandemic, the industry is being impacted by an increased worldwide demand for electronic components that is anticipated to last at least through the end of this calendar year. This global shortage impacts HPE and the technology market segment as a whole. While we anticipate further industry-wide tightening we took proactive inventory buffering measures in order to position us well during the second half of the fiscal year and going forward. We will take additional inventory actions as appropriate in alignment to the market demand, and will continue to leverage strong partnerships and long-term agreements with our suppliers.\nBacklog\nBacklog represents the price of orders related to current or prior periods for which work has not been performed or goods have not been delivered as of the reporting period.\n7\nThe higher levels of backlog we experienced in the prior-year period due to the pandemic were largely delivered by the end of fiscal 2020. At the same time, the global pandemic resulted in an unprecedented demand for electronic devices, which, coupled with related industry-wide supply constraints, has led to a challenging supply chain environment. Additionally, the pandemic continues to play a role with ongoing delays to the global logistics environment. As a result, in the second half of fiscal 2021, we experienced a shortage of electric components and logistics timing issues which resulted in significantly higher levels of order backlog and commodity costs across our hardware segments, and particularly in Compute, Storage and Intelligent Edge. Currently, we expect these challenging supply chain conditions to persist in the near term.\nDuring the pandemic, we have also viewed backlog as an indication of demand health as governments around the world continue to impose restrictions on non-essential work activities and travel. As and when the pandemic subsides, our focus on backlog may again become less relevant as a reliable indicator of future demand.\nFor a further discussion of the risks, uncertainties and actions taken in response to the pandemic, see risks identified in the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A.\nInternational\nOur products and services are available worldwide. We believe geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for our customers, draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce, provides stability to our operations, provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends, and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products.\nA summary of our domestic and international results is set forth in Note 2, \"Segment Information\", to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II. Approximately 68% of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2021 came from sales outside the United States.\nFor a discussion of certain risks attendant to our international operations, see \"Risk Factors—Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes and the laws and regulatory regimes applying to international transactions or other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses, and financial condition,\" and \"—We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates\" in Item 1A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk\" in Item 7A of Part II and Note 13, \"Financial Instruments\", to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, which are incorporated herein by reference.\nResearch and Development\nInnovation is a key element of our culture and critical to our success. Our research and development efforts (\"R&D\") are focused on designing and developing products, services and solutions that anticipate customers' changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends. Our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers' experiences.\nExpenditures for R&D were $2.0 billion in fiscal 2021, $1.9 billion in fiscal 2020 and $1.8 billion in fiscal 2019. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative, high-quality products, services and solutions to maintain and enhance our competitive position.\nIncluded in the R&D work currently taking place at the Company are the following initiatives:\nIn Compute, we are developing high quality next-generation compute solutions (servers, server attached options, and software) that integrate the latest industry technology, which coupled with other innovations from HPE are aligned to the requirements of our customers. In the area of software-as-a-service we are developing a cloud-native, cloud-based server management solution to complement our existing portfolio.\nIn HPC & AI, we deliver high-performance compute, storage, artificial intelligence and networking systems and solutions for the most demanding workloads. Our R&D investments are focused on developing new technologies in high-performance fabric, artificial intelligence platforms, scalable memory systems, and high-performance storage and data solutions that underpin our differentiated offerings. We also invest in software to enable our solutions. These investments include high-performance computing and artificial intelligence developer tools, cloud-native and scalable cluster management software, and transaction processing software. HPC & AI also hosts an applied research group, Labs, where we invest in long term, disruptive R&D including photonics, advanced systems architectures, and artificial intelligence software that comprise a pipeline of technologies to consider for future commercialization. All of our products are being developed with the potential to be delivered in a consumption model including integrated into our HPE GreenLake platform.\n8\nIn the Storage data management domain, we are investing in new technologies to address the demand in current and emerging markets. Our comprehensive on-premise scalable infrastructure is transforming to utilize HPE’s leadership in Compute, Networking, and Storage to provide end-to-end cloud-native infrastructure. This infrastructure serves as a foundation for our as-a-service offering, includes the industry-first 100% guarantee, and delivers cloud-native infrastructure tightly integrated and managed by our AI engines. Creatively augmented by an all-inclusive as-a-service HPE GreenLake offering, HPE continues to power the edge-to-core-to-cloud data pipeline with embedded AI that delivers deep learning analytics across the full data lifecycle.\nIn Intelligent Edge, we are investing in our cloud native Edge Services Platform (\"ESP\"), which enables simplified operation of wired and wireless networks, together with software defined wide area network (\"SD-WAN\") connectivity.  The ESP platform complements a broad range of network devices in our unified network infrastructure layer with security capabilities that enable us to identify and authenticate users and IoT endpoints, to enforce policy, and finely segment traffic based on context to contain security threats. We are also investing in automation, machine learning and artificial intelligence based network operations to optimize user experience and improve operator efficiency. Many of these capabilities are enabled with the Aruba Central cloud service, and we are investing to integrate Aruba Central as part of the broader HPE GreenLake as-a-service offering.\nIn Hewlett Packard Labs, we are focused on disruptive innovation and applied research in collaboration with other HPE business groups to deliver differentiated intellectual property (\"IP\"). Our innovation agenda is focused on developing technologies in the areas of system architecture, networking, AI, accelerators and silicon photonics. We also continue to invest in our silicon design capability to accelerate the development and delivery of our technology with custom integrated circuits.\nFor a discussion of risks attendant to our R&D activities, see \"Risk Factors—If we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative products, services and solutions, our business and financial performance may suffer\" in Item 1A.\nPatents\nOur general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. As of October 31, 2021, our worldwide patent portfolio included approximately 13,000 issued and pending patents.\nPatents generally have a term of up to 20 years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. We believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services, enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single patent is in itself essential to our company as a whole or to any of our business segments.\nIn addition to developing our patent portfolio, we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses and other rights under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. These license arrangements include a number of cross-licenses with third parties.\nFor a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see \"Risk Factors—Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend\" and \"—Our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties\" in Item 1A.\nSeasonality\nFrom time to time, the markets in which we sell our products, services and solutions experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months. However, the pandemic resulted in a temporary disruption to the seasonal fluctuation of our business. See \"Risk Factors—Our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable\" in Item 1A.\nCompetition\nWe have a broad technology portfolio of enterprise IT infrastructure products, solutions and services. We encounter strong competition in all areas of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service and support, security, and the availability of our IT infrastructure offerings.\n9\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with long-established positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms. Most product life cycles are relatively short, and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services, continuously enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed above, among others. In addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs that design, manufacture and market their products under their own brand names. Our successful management of these competitive partner relationships is critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive.\nThe competitive environments in which our segments operate are described below:\nThe\nCompute\nand\nStorage\nbusinesses operate in the highly competitive enterprise data center infrastructure market, which is characterized by rapid and ongoing technological innovation and price competition. Our primary competitors are technology vendors, such as Dell Technologies Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd., International Business Machines Corporation (\"IBM\"), and NetApp Inc. In certain regions, we also experience competition from local companies and from generically branded or \"white-box\" manufacturers. Our strategy is to deliver superior products, high-value technology support services and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our infrastructure, software and services capabilities. Our competitive advantages include our broad end-to-end solutions portfolio, supported by our strong intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities, coupled with our global reach and partner ecosystem.\nHPC & AI\npredominantly operates in the market for data-intensive super-computing, analytics, and artificial intelligence. Our primary competitors are compute technology vendors that can design and build solutions that deliver performance scalability and connectivity necessary to handle super-compute and AI workloads, including Dell Technologies Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd., and IBM. Similar to the compute space, our strategy is to deliver superior products, high-value technology support services and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our infrastructure, software and services capabilities. Our competitive advantages include our deep expertise and capabilities designing and delivering these solutions, broad end-to-end solutions portfolio, supported by our strong intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities, coupled with our global reach and partner ecosystem.\nIntelligent Edge\noperates in the highly competitive networking and connectivity infrastructure market, which is characterized by rapid and ongoing technological innovation and price competition. Our primary competitors are technology vendors, such as Cisco Systems, Inc., Extreme Networks, Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc., and Arista Networks Inc. Our strategy is to deliver superior enterprise wired and wireless local-area networking components and software, high-value technology support services and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our infrastructure, software and services capabilities. Our competitive advantage includes our broad end-to-end solutions portfolio, supported by our strong intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities, coupled with our global reach and partner ecosystem.\nFinancial Services.\nIn our financing business, our primary competitors are captive financing companies, such as IBM Global Financing, Dell Financial Services, and Cisco Capital, as well as banks and other financial institutions. Our primary IT Asset Disposition (\"ITAD\") competitors are ERI, Ingram Micro, Sage Sustainable Electronics, and Sims Recycling Solutions. We believe our competitive advantage over banks, other financial institutions, and ITAD providers is our ability to bring together our investment solutions with our expertise in managing technology assets. Not only are we able to deliver investment solutions that help customers create unique technology deployments based on specific business needs, but we also help them extract value from existing IT investments while more efficiently managing the retirement of those assets. All of these solutions can help customers accelerate digital transformation, create new budget streams, and meet Circular Economy objectives.\nFor a discussion of certain risks attendant to these competitive environments, see \"Risk Factors—We operate in an intensely competitive industry, and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance\" in Item 1A.\nClimate Change\nLiving Progress -\nLiving Progress is our business strategy for creating sustainable IT solutions that meet the technology demands of the future, while advancing the way people live and work. This strategy underpins our commitment to the environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG\") factors most important to stakeholders. Our edge-to-cloud strategy helps our customers transform and digitize their business while reducing our environmental footprint. A legacy of ESG leadership increases our competitiveness and differentiates us in the marketplace by helping our customers achieve their business objectives and sustainability goals. The HPE Board of Directors provides oversight of our ESG strategy, practices, and policies to ensure integration with our core business strategy.\nSustainable Value Creation\n- Sustainability performance has become a core business discipline within HPE. Our Living Progress program is an increasingly powerful component of our relationships with customers, and our sustainability credentials provide us with a competitive advantage, support talent acquisition and retention, and ensure ongoing access to global markets.\n10\nWe remain committed to becoming a net zero enterprise by no later than 2050, with near-term targets set across our value chain to measure our progress.\nIn 2021, most of our greenhouse gas emissions (\"GHG\") resulted from the manufacture and use of our products. We recognize the opportunity to innovate technologies for a carbon-constrained world and are committed to delivering products and services that empower our customers to operate sustainably and efficiently while also gaining maximum productivity from their IT investments and reducing costs. For instance, as-a-service delivery models can drive the reduction of our climate impact and that of our customers, by eliminating IT inefficiencies and enabling sustainable digital transformations. HPE GreenLake, the Company's as-a-service offering, allows customers to consume IT resources and spend capital expenditures as needed, thereby reducing the energy and resource consumption of IT infrastructure through improved utilization and provisioning.\nTo ensure market access across the globe many of our products are certified by eco-labels such as Electronic Product Environment Assessment Tool, TCO Certified, Energy STAR, China SEPA and the China Energy Conservation Program, thus helping our customers make responsible purchasing choices.\nMaterial Government Regulations\nOur business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and our products and services are governed by a number of rules and regulations. Costs and accruals incurred to comply with these governmental regulations are presently not material to our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future government laws applicable to our operations, services or products will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position, we do not currently anticipate material expenditures for government regulations. Nonetheless, as discussed below, we believe that global trade and certain ESG regulations could potentially materially impact our business.\nEnvironment\nOur products and operations are, or may in the future be, subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations concerning the environment, including, among others, laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water; the management, movement, and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites; product safety, such as chemical composition, packaging and labeling; energy consumption of our products and services; and the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances. We are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods, including servers and networking equipment, financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as \"product take-back legislation\"). Finally, as climate change and other ESG-related laws, regulations, treaties, and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world, we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions, including fines. However, we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements, and we are collaborating with industry, business groups and governments to find and promote ways that our technology can be used to address climate change and other ESG-related issues, and to facilitate compliance with related laws, regulations and treaties.  We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental and ESG-related laws applicable to our operations, products and services, and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business. We meet this commitment with a comprehensive environmental, health and safety policy; a strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services; an extensive supply chain responsibility program; and an approach to ethical standards and strong governance that are the foundations of our business.\nGlobal Trade\nAs a global company, the import and export of our products and services are subject to laws and regulations including international treaties, U.S. export controls and sanctions laws, customs regulations, and local trade rules around the world. Such laws, rules and regulations may delay the introduction of some of our products or impact our competitiveness through restricting our ability to do business in certain places or with certain entities and individuals, or the need to comply with domestic preference programs, laws concerning transfer and disclosure of sensitive or controlled technology or source code, unique technical standards, localization mandates, and duplicative in-country testing and inspection requirements. The consequences of any failure to comply with domestic and foreign trade regulations could limit our ability to conduct business globally.  We continue to support open trade policies that recognize the importance of integrated cross-border supply chains that will continue to contribute to the growth of the global economy and measures that standardize compliance for manufacturers to ensure that products comply with safety and security requirements.\nFor a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations that may materially impact us, see \"Regulatory Risks\" within \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A.\n11\nAdditional Information\nItanium is a trademark of Intel Corporation or its subsidiaries.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nThe following are our current executive officers:\nAntonio Neri; President and Chief Executive Officer\nMr. Neri has served as our President and Chief Executive Officer since June 2017 and February 2018, respectively.

    "text": "You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating Hewlett Packard Enterprise and its common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nWe are unable to predict the extent to which the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our business operations, financial performance and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have significantly curtailed the movement of people, goods and services worldwide, including in most or all of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations. The pandemic has resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity, including travel restrictions, prohibitions of non-essential activities in some cases, disruption and shutdown of businesses and greater uncertainty in global financial markets. Our operations have been affected by a range of external factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are not within our control, including the various restrictions imposed by cities, counties, states and countries on our employees, customers, partners and suppliers designed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Although the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have been assessed, the long-term magnitude and duration of the disruption and resulting decline in business activity is still highly uncertain and cannot currently be predicted.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to ensure the safety of our employees, we have implemented a global work-from-home policy until further notice that applies to a significant majority of our employees, with the exception of those performing essential activities. Most recently, we have announced a vaccination requirement for covered U.S. employees as required by Executive Order 14042 for federal contractors. We recognize that there are existing legal challenges to Executive Order 14042, and we will ensure that the timing and scope of the implementation of our vaccination requirement is consistent with the legal status of Executive Order 14042. Our employees may elect to return to the office in jurisdictions where both local requirements and our own health and safety standards have been met. As such instances occur, employees have returned to the office in a phased process and remain subject to safety regimens anchored around vaccination or testing requirements, as we determine is appropriate based on local conditions. Moreover, certain industry and customer events that we sponsor or at which we present have been canceled, postponed or moved to virtual-only experiences, and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional events in the future. We are also seeing an increase in customer requirements for HPE employees to be vaccinated and/or tested for COVID-19 before being able to enter customer sites, which could potentially present an operational challenge. Also, work-from-home and other modified business practices introduce additional operational risks, including cybersecurity risks, which may result in inefficiencies or delays, and have affected the way we conduct our product development, sales, customer support and other activities. Unanticipated disruptions in services provided through our localized physical infrastructure caused by the COVID-19 pandemic can curtail the functioning of critical components of our IT systems, and adversely affect our ability to fulfill orders, provide services, respond to customer requests and maintain our worldwide business operations. Our implementation of employee vaccination requirements may result in attrition, including attrition of critically skilled labor, and difficulty securing future labor needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe pandemic has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business, by negatively impacting the demand for our products and services; restricting our operations and sales, marketing and distribution efforts; disrupting the supply chains of hardware products; and disrupting our research and development capabilities, engineering, design and manufacturing processes and other important business activities. There have been, and will continue to be, delays of hardware product shipments from our vendors and out of our manufacturing operations worldwide as a result of capacity issues. We also expect product shipment delays as a result of shortages and capacity issues that continue to impact logistics operations.\nWe expect the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have a negative impact on our sales and our results of operations, the size and duration of which we are currently unable to predict. While such changes were factored into the forecast used to assess assets for reserves and impairment, including goodwill, any changes to the profitability for the next fiscal year could impact the realizability of assets. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price, our ability to access capital markets and our ability to fund liquidity needs.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n15\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur worldwide operations and supply chain could be disrupted by natural or human-induced disasters including, but not limited to, earthquakes; tsunamis; floods; hurricanes, cyclones or typhoons; fires; other extreme weather conditions; power or water shortages; telecommunications failures; materials scarcity and price volatility; terrorist acts, civil unrest, conflicts or wars; and medical epidemics or pandemics. We are predominantly self-insured to mitigate the impact of most catastrophic events. Although it is impossible to completely predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, forecasting disruptive events and building additional resiliency into our operations accordingly will become an increasing business imperative. The occurrence of business disruptions could result in significant losses, seriously harm our revenue, profitability and financial condition, adversely affect our competitive position, increase our costs and expenses, decrease in demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers, create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain, result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations.\nClimate change serves as a risk multiplier increasing both the frequency and severity of natural disasters that may affect our worldwide business operations. Our corporate headquarters is located in Houston, Texas, which suffers from floods, hurricanes, and other extreme weather, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, which suffers from drought conditions and catastrophic wildfires, each affecting the health and safety of our employees. In California, to mitigate wildfire risk, electric utilities are deploying public safety power shutoffs, which affects electricity reliability to our facilities and our communities. In 2017, our principal worldwide IT data centers in Houston were flooded due to Hurricane Harvey. Since then, HPE has increased its resiliency through site selection and infrastructure technological investments to mitigate and adapt to physical risks from climate change.\nThe manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including the United States, Czech Republic, Mexico, China, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Singapore. We also rely on major logistics hubs, which are strategically located near manufacturing facilities in the major regions and in proximity to HPE's distribution channels and customers. Our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, IT system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. Other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in California and Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near vulnerable locations is continuing to be assessed.\nOur transition to a subscription/consumption-based business model may adversely affect our business, operating results and free cash flow.\nWe are currently transitioning to an as-a-service company, providing our entire portfolio through a range of subscription/consumption-based, pay-per-use and as-a-service offerings. We will also continue to provide our hardware and software in a capital expenditure and license-based model, ultimately giving our customers choices in consuming HPE products and services in a traditional or as-a-service offering. Such business model changes entail significant risks and uncertainties, and we may be unable to complete the transition to a subscription/consumption-based business model or manage the transition successfully and in a timely manner, and our ability to accurately forecast our future operating results may be adversely affected.  Additionally, we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the subscription/consumption transition, even if we successfully complete the transition. The transition to a subscription/consumption-based business model also means that our historical results, especially those achieved before we began the transition, may not be indicative of our future results. Further, as customer demand for our consumption model offerings increases, we will experience differences in the timing of revenue recognition between our traditional offerings (for which revenue is generally recognized at the time of delivery) and our as-a-service offerings (for which revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement).\nIn addition, the transition to an as-a-service company is expected to require incremental capital requirements, resulting in a negative impact to cash flows in the near term, and may require us to dedicate additional resources, including sales and marketing costs. Furthermore, we anticipate needing to redesign our go-to-market structure, to better align with the subscription/consumption-based business model. We must adapt our sales processes for new sales and marketing approaches, including those required by our shift to subscription/consumption services and other changes resulting from the pandemic. Changing our go-to-market structure may affect employee compensation models and ultimately our ability to retain employees. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these adjustments in a timely or cost-effective manner, or that we will be able to realize all or any of the expected benefits from such adjustments. Further, our subscription/consumption offerings could subject us to increased risk of liability related to the provision of services as well as operational, technical, legal or other costs.\n16\nWe depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our supplier relationships properly.\nOur operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components, products and services, as well as our suppliers' abilities to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components, products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services. Given the wide variety of solutions that we offer, the large and diverse distribution of our suppliers and contract manufacturers, and the long lead times required to manufacture, assemble and deliver certain solutions, problems could arise in production, planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business. In addition, our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming and resource-intensive than expected. Furthermore, certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us. Other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages, excess supply, and contractual, relational and labor risks, each of which is described below.\n•\nComponent shortages.\nWe have been and currently are experiencing delays and shortages of certain components as a result of strong demand and capacity constraints due to economic changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, disruptions in the operations of component suppliers, and other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers. A surge in demand for silicon has arisen across numerous markets affecting availability of key components of our products and our supplier's products, which may adversely affect customer deliveries and our anticipated revenues. As shortages or delays persist, the price of certain components has increased and may continue to increase, we may be exposed to quality issues, or, at some point, the components may not be available at all. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications. Accordingly, our business and financial performance could suffer if we lose time-sensitive sales, incur additional freight costs or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers. If we cannot adequately address supply issues, we might have to reengineer some product or service offerings, which could result in further costs and delays.\n•\nExcess supply.\nIn order to secure components for our products or services, at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into long term agreements or non-cancelable commitments with vendors. In addition, we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\n•\nContractual terms.\nAs a result of binding long-term price or purchase commitments with vendors, we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions. If we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the then-current market price, we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices, our gross margin could suffer, and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence. Any of these developments could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.\n•\nContingent workers.\nWe also rely on third-party suppliers for the provision of contingent workers, and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations. We have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future. We may be subject to shortages, oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers. Our ability to manage the size of, and costs associated with, the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws.\n•\nSingle-source suppliers.\nWe obtain certain components from single-source suppliers due to technology, availability, price, quality, scale or customization needs. Replacing a single-source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may initially be unable to meet demand or be subject to other output limitations. For some components, such as customized components, alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements. In addition, we sometimes purchase components from single-source suppliers under short-term agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty. The performance of such single-source suppliers under those agreements (and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect the quality, quantity and price of our components. The loss of a single-source supplier, the deterioration of our relationship with a single-source supplier or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single-source supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\n17\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans and our periodic restructuring programs can be disruptive to our business.\nWe have announced restructuring plans, including the HPE Next initiative (whereby we are simplifying our operating model and streamlining our offerings, business processes and business systems) and the cost optimization and prioritization plan, in order to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs, as well as simplify our organizational structure, upgrade our IT infrastructure and redesign business processes. We may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring. Additionally, as a result of restructuring initiatives, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency during transitional periods. Reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. If we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For more information about our restructuring plans, the HPE Next initiative and the cost optimization and prioritization plan, see Note 3, \"Transformation Programs\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAny failure by us to identify, manage and complete acquisitions and subsequent integrations, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects.\nAs part of our strategy, we may acquire businesses, divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures, and make investments to further our business (collectively, \"business combination and investment transactions\"), and also handle any post-closing issues, such as integration. For example, in September 2020, we acquired Silver Peak Systems, Inc., an SD-WAN industry leader and in September 2019, we acquired Cray Inc., a global supercomputer leader. In April 2017 and September 2017, we spun off our Enterprise Services and Software businesses, respectively. See also the risk factors below under the heading \"Risks Related to Prior Separations.\"\nRisks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following, any of which could adversely affect our financial results, including our effective tax rate:\n•\nWe may not successfully combine product or service offerings or fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and investment transaction, which may result in (1) failure to retain employees, customers, distributors, and suppliers; (2) increase in unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations which may cause financial results to differ from expectations; and (3) significant increase in costs and expenses, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, inventory adjustments, assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans.\n•\nOur ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions, and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence, is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third parties or their representatives. We may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired company's product quality, financial disclosures, accounting practices or internal control deficiencies or all of the factors necessary to estimate reasonably accurate costs, timing and other matters.\n•\nIn order to complete a business combination and investment transaction, we may issue common stock, potentially creating dilution for our existing stockholders or we may enter into financing arrangements, which could affect our liquidity and financial condition.\n•\nFor an acquisition or other combination, the acquisition partner may have differing or inadequate cybersecurity and data protection controls, which could impact our exposure to data security incidents and potentially increase anticipated costs or time to integrate the business.\n•\nBusiness combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation, which could impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n•\nWe have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions and, to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired, we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.\n•\nFor a divestiture, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, or we may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated.\n•\nThe impact of divestitures on our revenue growth may be larger than projected, as we may experience greater dis-synergies than expected. If we do not satisfy pre-closing conditions and necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms, it may prevent us from completing the transaction. Dispositions may also involve\n18\ncontinued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results.\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult or discourage an acquisition of Hewlett Packard Enterprise if our Board of Directors deems it to be undesirable. Provisions such as indemnification, meeting requirements, and blank check stock authorizations could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests, or changes in control or management of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\nManagement's attention or other resources may be diverted during business combination and investment transactions and further impacted if we fail to successfully complete or integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives.\nSystem security risks, data protection incidents, cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or IT services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.\nAs a leading technology firm we are exposed to attacks from criminals, nation state actors and activist hackers (collectively, \"malicious parties\") who have been able to circumvent or bypass our cyber security measures. Although some of these attacks have caused disruptions or exposure of information, so far, these attacks have not resulted in material losses to HPE, nor have any of HPE's consumers, customers, or employees informed HPE that these attacks resulted in material harm to them. It is possible that future attacks may result in material misappropriation, system disruptions or shutdowns, malicious alteration, or destruction of our confidential or personal information or that of third parties. Malicious parties also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. Malicious parties may compromise our manufacturing supply chain to embed malicious software or hardware in our products for use in compromising our customers. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including flaws that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, including bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities, could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.\nWe manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business. In addition, our business may process, store and transmit customer data, including commercially sensitive and personal data, subject to the European General Data Protection Regulation and other privacy laws. With our business increasingly providing cloud service offerings, malicious parties could target such services, potentially resulting in an increased risk of compromise of customer data and regulatory exposure. Incidents involving our cyber or physical security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information, sensitive, confidential, or personal data about us, our clients or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in regulatory fines, litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. We also could lose existing or potential customers of services or other IT solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers' system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of managing an incident and implementing further data protection measures could be significant.\nPortions of our IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and resource intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.\nIf we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative products, services and solutions, our business and financial performance may suffer.\nOur long-term strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio of hardware, software and services as we deliver global edge-to-cloud platform as-a-service to help customers accelerate outcomes by unlocking value from all of their data, everywhere. HPE delivers unique, open and intelligent technology solutions, including those utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities, with a consistent experience across all clouds and edge computing platforms. To successfully execute this strategy, we must address business model shifts and optimize go-to-market execution by improving cost structure,\n19\naligning sales coverage with strategic goals, improving channel execution and strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, while continuing to pursue new product innovation that builds on our strategic capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing, software-defined networking, converged storage, high-performance compute, and wireless networking. Any failure to successfully execute this strategy, including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe process of developing an edge-to-cloud platform as-a-service solution and enhancing existing hardware and software products, services, and solutions is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share, results of operations and financial condition. For example, as the transition to an environment characterized by cloud-based computing and software being delivered as-a-service progresses, we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloud-based solutions for our customers. We must make long-term investments, develop or obtain and protect appropriate intellectual property, and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products, services and solutions. Should such efforts fail to produce actionable insights or our products not perform as promised, our business results may be adversely affected. Any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends, control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial performance. Our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part, including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding and/or personnel.\nAfter we develop an edge-to-cloud platform product, we must be able to scale quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins. To accomplish this, we must accurately forecast volumes, mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements, and we may not succeed at doing so within a given product's life cycle or at all. Any delay in the development, production or marketing of a new product, service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market, which could further harm our competitive position.\nIf we cannot continue to produce quality products and services, our reputation, business and financial performance may suffer\n.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products, services and solutions, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by third-party contractors or subcontractors or their employees. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions. However, the products, services and solutions that we offer are complex, and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors, particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties. If we are unable to determine the cause, find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix (or \"patch\") to address quality issues with our products, we may delay shipment to customers, which could delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our revenue, cash flows and profitability. In addition, after products are delivered, quality issues may require us to repair or replace such products. Addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, repair, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our financial performance. If new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions, our results of operations could be adversely affected, and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers' expectations. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation, which could, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our business and financial performance could suffer.\nWe use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world, including both direct and indirect (distributors and resellers) sales to enterprise accounts and consumers. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability.\nOur financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement. Moreover, some of our wholesale distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including economic weakness, industry consolidation and market trends. Many of our\n20\nsignificant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution channel partners. Revenue from indirect sales could suffer, and we could experience disruptions in distribution, if our distributors' financial conditions, abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken.\nOur inventory management is complex, as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors. We must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges. Distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues, and therefore make forecasting more difficult. If we have excess or obsolete inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory. Moreover, our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors. We also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition key employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition qualified executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, development, sales, marketing and IT support positions. In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash- and equity-based compensation. Certain equity-based incentive awards for certain executives contain conditions relating to our stock price performance and our long-term financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain. If the anticipated value of such equity-based incentive awards does not materialize, if our equity-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity-based incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened.\nOur failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIndustry Risks\nWe operate in an intensely competitive industry, and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance.\nWe encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business, and our competitors have targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments. We compete primarily on the basis of our technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, product range and ease of use, account relationships, customer training, service and support, and security of our offerings. If our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria, our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed.\nWe have a large portfolio of products and services and must allocate our financial, personnel and other resources across all of our products and services while competing with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product or service lines. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do, and our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their products and services. Industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate. Additionally, our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers.\nCompanies with whom we have vertical relationships in certain areas may be or become our competitors in other areas. In addition, companies with whom we have vertical relationships also may acquire or form relationships with our competitors, which could reduce their business with us. If we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with vertical partners, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive, while simultaneously seeking to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin. In addition,\n21\ncompetitors who have a greater presence in some of the lower-cost markets in which we compete, or who can obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer. Our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures.\nBecause our business model is based on providing innovative and high-quality products and services, we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors. If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure (apart from research and development expenses) on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures, our gross margin and, therefore, our profitability could be adversely affected. In addition, if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive, or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions, we may lose market share in certain areas, which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects.\nEven if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product, its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete. For example, our Storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market transition towards software defined and public cloud, which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage products. Financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products.\nInternational Risks\nDue to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes and the laws and regulatory regimes applying to international transactions or other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses, and financial condition.\nOur business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware, software and services in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products, services and solutions, may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges, and may make it more difficult for us to manage inventory and make accurate forecasts of revenue, gross margin, cash flows and expenses.\nEconomic weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations. Any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations, as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of market volatility and disruption. Poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and post-retirement benefit expenses. Interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates, borrowing costs, currency exchange rates, and costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments. Economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses. Further, ongoing U.S. federal government spending priorities may limit demand for our products, services and solutions from organizations that receive funding from the U.S. government, and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the United States, which could further reduce demand for our products, services and solutions.\nOur business and financial performance also could be adversely affected by changes in U.S. trade policy, U.S. export controls and sanctions, and U.S. regulations concerning imports, as well as international laws and regulations relating to global trade.\nCurrent U.S. government trade policy includes the imposition of tariffs on certain foreign goods, including information and communication technology products. These measures have materially increased costs for certain goods imported into the United States. This in turn could require us to materially increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in lowering our margin on products sold.\nU.S. government trade policy has resulted in, and could result in more, U.S. trading partners adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries.\nSimilarly, changes in regulations relating to exports could prevent us from exporting products to certain locations or customers entirely.\nIn addition, changes in requirements relating to making foreign direct investments could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets, affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components, increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions.\nSales outside the United States constituted approximately 68% of our net revenue in fiscal 2021. Our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors, including:\n•\nongoing instability or changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, including uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic;\n22\n•\ninflationary pressures, such as those the market is currently experiencing, which may increase costs for materials, supplies, and services;\n•\nnetwork security, privacy and data sovereignty concerns, which could make foreign customers reluctant to purchase products and services from U.S.-based technology companies;\n•\nlonger collection cycles and financial instability among customers;\n•\nlocal labor conditions and regulations, including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\"), or changes to immigration and labor law policies which may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent;\n•\nmanaging our geographically dispersed workforce;\n•\ndiffering technology standards or customer requirements;\n•\ndifficulties associated with repatriating earnings in restricted countries, and changes in tax laws; and\n•\nfluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments.\nThe factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the United States. For example, we rely on suppliers in Asia for product assembly and manufacture.\nWe implement policies, procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with anti-corruption laws around the world, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.\nBut in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, people may engage in business practices prohibited by anti-corruption laws. Our employees and third parties we work with may take actions in violation of our policies, and those actions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nCurrencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, the British pound, Chinese yuan (renminbi) and the Japanese yen, can have an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, most notably the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the United States and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the United States.\nFrom time to time, we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks. The effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. We may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations. In addition, certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective, may expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nOur financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend.\nWe rely upon patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the United States, similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell, provide or otherwise use in our operations. However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use; this, too, could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position.\nOur products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third parties.\nMuch of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties. For example, many of our software offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties, including through both proprietary and open source licenses. These third-party software components may become\n23\nobsolete, defective or incompatible with future versions of our products, or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate, or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated. We may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships. In order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses, we must carefully monitor and manage our use of third-party software components, including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms. Additionally, some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product offerings to remain competitive. Our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business, including our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition, third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction. Because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license us at all, or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our competitors. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement, including patent infringement, are commonplace in the IT industry and successful third-party claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services.\nThird parties may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights.  Patent assertion entities frequently purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of extracting infringement settlements. If we cannot license, or replace, allegedly infringed intellectual property on reasonable terms, our operations could be adversely affected. Even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend against and may divert management's attention and resources away from our business. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, discontinue certain product offerings, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing, marketing or selling certain of our products. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us.\nFinancial Risks\nFailure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.\nWe currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings Services. Despite these investment grade credit ratings, any future downgrades could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our derivative contracts. Additionally, increased borrowing costs, including those arising from a credit rating downgrade, can potentially reduce the competitiveness of our financing business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets.\nOur debt obligations may adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations and pay dividends.\nIn addition to our current total carrying debt, we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. This collective amount of debt could have important adverse consequences to us and our investors, including:\n•\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments;\n•\nmaking it more difficult to satisfy other obligations;\n•\nincreasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing;\n•\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n•\nreducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business;\n•\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n•\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase our common stock.\nTo the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our\n24\noutstanding debt or to repay our outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to service or refinance our debt.\nThe revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes our future financial results less predictable.\nOur revenue, gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services, customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future periods than our historical results. Our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services. Delays or reductions in IT spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services, which could result in a significant decline in revenue. In addition, revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose cross-selling opportunities. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product, service, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period's net revenue. Competition, lawsuits, investigations, increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers, component supply disruptions and other risks affecting our businesses may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability. Variations in fixed cost structure and gross margins across business units and product portfolios may lead to significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, newer geographic market opportunities may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures, and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets. Market trends, industry shifts, competitive pressures, commoditization of products, increased component or shipping costs, regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period, which may lead to adjustments to our operations. Moreover, our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period.\nOur uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.\nIn some of our businesses, our quarterly sales have periodically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter's total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult, increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If predicted demand is substantially greater than orders, there may be excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled. Depending on when they occur in a quarter, developments such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages or global logistics disruptions, could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected.  We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.\nWe make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" In addition, as discussed in Note 1, \"Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Use of Estimates\" and Note 17, \"Litigation and Contingencies,\" to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we make certain estimates, including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other contingencies. While we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRegulatory Risks\nOur business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations such as those concerning environmental protection.  For example, we face increasing complexity related to product design, the use of regulated, hazardous and scarce materials, the associated energy consumption and efficiency related to the use of products, the transportation and shipping of products, climate change regulations, and the reuse, recycling and/or disposal of products and their components at end-of-use or useful life as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to our transition to a more circular economy. A significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Any changes to current environmental legal requirements, such\n25\nas the EU Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive or China's regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, among others, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU, China and/or other countries proposing or adopting similar environmental legal requirements. In addition, other ESG-related laws, regulations, treaties, and similar initiatives and programs are being proposed, adopted and implemented throughout the world (including, but not limited to, the European Commission’s proposal on Sustainable Corporate Governance). If we were to violate or become liable under environmental or certain ESG-related laws or if our products become non-compliant with such laws or market access requirements, our customers may refuse to purchase our products, and we could incur costs or face other sanctions, such as restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions, fines, and/or civil or criminal sanctions. Environmental regulations may also impact the availability and cost of energy or emissions related to energy consumption which may increase our cost of manufacturing and/or the cost of powering and cooling owned IT infrastructures.\nIn addition, our business is subject to an ever-growing number of laws addressing privacy and information security. In particular, we face an increasingly complex regulatory environment as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the security of our offerings. If we were to violate or become liable under laws or regulations associated with privacy or security, we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions. Our potential exposure includes regulatory fines and civil or criminal sanctions third-party claims and reputational damage.\nFailure to comply with government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur contracts with federal, state, provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various government procurement laws and regulations, required contract provisions, and other requirements relating to contract formation, administration, and performance. Any violation of government contracting laws and regulations or contract terms could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and fines, treble damages, and suspension from future government contracting. Such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business. In addition, we will continue to be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts. If we are suspended or disbarred from government work or if our ability to compete for new government contracts is adversely affected, our financial performance could suffer.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  Our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters, and may assess additional taxes as a result. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international association of 34 countries including the United States, has proposed changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. These proposals, if finalized and adopted by the associated countries, would impose a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, could increase tax complexity and uncertainty, and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.\nThe U.S. House of Representatives has passed legislation consistent with the framework President Biden announced previously, which includes a number of changes that would impact the U.S. federal taxation of corporations.\nAmong other items, the legislation includes provisions that would raise the tax rate on foreign income of U.S. corporations, apply the Global Intangible Low-Tax Income regime on a country-by-country basis, impose a new alternative minimum tax on book income, and impose a surcharge on corporate stock buybacks.\nThe U.S. Senate has not voted on or agreed to the legislation, but if this happens and President Biden signs it into law, it could materially impact our tax provision, cash tax liability and effective tax rate.\nDuring fiscal 2019, we executed a Termination and Mutual Release Agreement which terminated our Tax Matters Agreement with HP Inc. Because we now have limited indemnity rights from HP Inc., we potentially bear more economic risk for certain potential unfavorable tax assessments.\n26\nRisks Related to Prior Separations\nThe stock distribution in either or both of the completed separations of our former Enterprise Services business and our former Software segment could result in significant tax liability, and DXC or Micro Focus (as applicable) may in certain cases be obligated to indemnify us for any such tax liability imposed on us.\nThe completed separations of our former Enterprise Services business and our Software Segment were conditioned upon the receipt of an opinion from outside counsel regarding the qualification of (i) the relevant distribution and related transactions as a \"reorganization\" within the meaning of Sections 368(a), 361 and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \"Code\"); and (ii) the relevant merger as a \"reorganization\" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. While the Software Separation generally qualified for tax-free treatment for us, Seattle SpinCo and Micro Focus, the acquisition of Seattle SpinCo by Micro Focus resulted in the recognition of gain (but not loss) for U.S. persons who received Micro Focus American Depositary Shares in the Software Separation.\nEach opinion of outside counsel was based upon and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of us, Everett SpinCo and CSC, or us, Seattle SpinCo and Micro Focus, as applicable. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if any party breaches any of its covenants in the relevant separation documents, the relevant opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized. Notwithstanding the opinions of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") could determine that either or both of the distributions should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations, statements or undertakings upon which the relevant opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated, or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert a contrary position.\nIf the distribution of Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable, together with certain related transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, in general, we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the stock of Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable, in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our stockholders who receive Everett SpinCo shares or Seattle SpinCo shares in the relevant distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.\nWe obtained private letter rulings from the IRS regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the separation of our Enterprise Services business and Software Segment.  Those rulings concluded that certain transactions in those separations are generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  The conclusions of the IRS private letter rulings were based, among other things, on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to the IRS. If any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, the validity of the IRS private letter rulings may be affected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we incurred certain tax costs in connection with the completed separation of our former Enterprise Services business and Software Segment, including non-U.S. tax expenses resulting from the completed separation of our former Enterprise Services business and Software Segment in multiple non-U.S. jurisdictions that do not legally provide for tax-free separations, which may be material.  If the completed separation of our former Enterprise Services business or Software Segment (including certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of those separations) are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and/or DXC and/or Micro Focus could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nUnder the tax matters agreements entered into by us with Everett SpinCo and CSC, and with Seattle SpinCo and Micro Focus, Everett SpinCo and Seattle SpinCo generally would be required to indemnify us for any taxes resulting from the relevant separation (and any related costs and other damages) to the extent such amounts resulted from (i) certain actions taken by, or acquisitions of capital stock of, Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable (excluding actions required by the documents governing the relevant separation), or (ii) any breach of certain representations and covenants made by Everett SpinCo or Seattle SpinCo, as applicable. Any such indemnity obligations could be material.\nWe continue to face a number of risks related to the Separation from our former Parent, including those associated with ongoing indemnification obligations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, and shared use of certain intellectual property rights, which could in the future adversely impact our reputation.\nIn connection with the Separation, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. entered into several agreements that determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the Separation and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. In these agreements, HP Inc. agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify HP Inc. for certain liabilities, including cross-indemnities that are designed and intended to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of our business with us, and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of HP Inc.'s business with HP Inc. We may be obligated to fully indemnify HP Inc. for certain liabilities under the\n27\nSeparation agreements or HP Inc. may not be able to fully cover their indemnification obligations to us under the same Separation agreements. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the terms of the Separation also include licenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the operations of both businesses. For example, through a joint brand holding structure, both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain variations of the legacy Hewlett-Packard and HP branding, respectively. As a result of this continuing shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of HP Inc. could also adversely affect the reputation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\nGeneral Risks\nOur stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which may make future prices of our stock difficult to predict.\nInvestors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Our stock price, like that of other technology companies, can be volatile and can be affected by, among other things, speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community; the announcement of new, planned or contemplated products, services, technological innovations, acquisitions, divestitures or other significant transactions by us or our competitors; our quarterly financial results and comparisons to estimates by the investment community or financial outlook provided by us; the financial results and business strategies of our competitors; inflation; developments relating to pending investigations, claims and disputes; or the timing and amount of our share repurchases. General or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to Hewlett Packard Enterprise's performance also may affect the price of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's stock. Volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.\n28"

On November 30, 2021 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, payable on January 7, 2022, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 10, 2021.\nThe payment of any dividends in the future, and the timing and amount thereof, is within the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors' decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, restrictive covenants in our debt, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and on our access to the capital markets. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay a dividend in any future period.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn October 13, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program with a $3.0 billion authorization, which was refreshed with additional share repurchase authorizations of $3.0 billion, $5.0 billion and $2.5 billion on May 24, 2016, October 16, 2017 and February 21, 2018, respectively. This program, which does not have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions. The Company may choose to repurchase shares when sufficient liquidity exists and the shares are trading at a discount relative to estimated intrinsic value.\nOn April 6, 2020, the Company announced that it suspended purchases under its share repurchase program in response to the global economic uncertainty that resulted from the worldwide spread of the novel coronavirus. On September 2, 2021, the Company announced that it reinstated the share repurchase program.\nDuring the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, the Company repurchased and settled 14.7 million shares of the Company's common stock. The Company had unsettled open market repurchases of 0.8 million shares as of October 31, 2021. Shares repurchased during fiscal 2021 were recorded as a $225 million reduction to stockholders' equity. As of October 31, 2021, the Company had a remaining authorization of $1.9 billion for future share repurchases.\nStock Performance Graph and Cumulative Total Return\nThe graph below shows the cumulative total stockholder return, the S&P 500 Index and the S&P Information Technology Index.

References in the MD&A section to \"former Parent\" refer to HP Inc.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020. Discussions of fiscal 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in \"Part II,  Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on December 10, 2020, which is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\nWe intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist the reader in understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear in Part II, Item 8 of this document.\nThis MD&A is organized as follows:\n•\nTrends and Uncertainties.\nA discussion of material events and uncertainties known to management such as COVID-19, our response to the challenges and trends, and our pivot to as-a-service strategy.\n•\nExecutive Overview.\nA discussion of our business and summary analysis of financial and other highlights, including non-GAAP financial measures, affecting the Company in order to provide context to the remainder of the MD&A.\n•\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\nA discussion of accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results.\n•\nResults of Operations.\nA discussion of the results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a discussion of the results of operations at the segment level.\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources.\nAn analysis of changes in our cash flows and a discussion of our financial condition and liquidity.\n•\nContractual Cash and Other Obligations.\nAn overview of contractual obligations, retirement and post-retirement benefit plan funding, restructuring plans, uncertain tax positions and off-balance sheet arrangements.\n•\nGAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\n. Each non-GAAP measure has been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure therein. This section also includes a discussion on the usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, and material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures.\nTRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nCOVID-19\nWhile great progress has been made in the fight against COVID-19, it remains a global challenge and continues to have an impact on our operations. For a further discussion of the pandemic and the risks, uncertainties and actions taken in response to it, see the discussion in the section titled \"COVID-19 Pandemic Update\", \"Manufacturing and Materials\" and \"Backlog\" in Part I, Item 1, and risks identified in the section entitled \" Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A.\nThe Company also believes that the pandemic has forced fundamental changes in businesses and communities that are aligned with the Company's edge-to-cloud platform delivered as-a-service strategy. Navigating through the pandemic and planning for a post-COVID world have increased customers' needs for as-a-service offerings, secure connectivity, remote work capabilities and analytics to unlock insights from data. Our solutions are aligned to these needs, and we see opportunity to help our customers drive digital transformations as they continue to adapt to operate in a new world.\n32\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nOther Trends and Uncertainties\nWe are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business. One set of challenges include dynamic and accelerating market trends, such as the market shift of workloads to cloud-related IT infrastructure business models, emergence of software-defined architectures and converged infrastructure functionality and growth in IT consumption models. Certain of our legacy hardware server and storage businesses face challenges as customers migrate to cloud-based offerings and reduce their purchases of hardware products. Therefore, the demand environment for traditional server and storage products is challenging and lower traditional compute and storage unit volume is impacting support attach opportunities within the associated services organization.\nAnother set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. Our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions, our business-specific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets, our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models, and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors.\nA third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution. We intend to provide our customers with a choice between traditional consumption models or subscription-based, pay-per-use and as-a-service offerings across our entire portfolio of HPE products and services.\nAdditionally, the global pandemic has accelerated several trends relevant to the Company. First, the exponential increase of data at the edge driven by the proliferation of devices. Second is the need for a cloud experience everywhere to manage the growth of data at the edge. Third, data growth is creating new opportunities with the need to quickly extract value from the captured data. Enterprises have embraced multi-cloud strategies, as they recognize the need for different cloud environments for different types of data and workloads. Increasingly, customers want to digitally transform, while preserving capital and eliminating operating expense, by paying only for the IT they use.\nIn response to the aforementioned challenges and trends, we are accelerating growth in our areas of strategic focus, which include the Intelligent Edge and High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence (\"HPC & AI\") businesses while at the same time, we are strengthening our core Compute and Storage businesses, doubling down in key areas of growth, and accelerating our as-a-service pivot to become the edge-to-cloud platform-as-a-service choice for our customers and partners\n.\nAt the same time our transformation programs have improved our cost structure, channel execution and alignment of our sales coverage with our strategic goals. We continue to pursue new product innovations that build on our existing capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing, software-defined networking, converged storage, high-performance compute, and wireless networking, which will keep us aligned with market demand, industry trends and the needs of our customers and partners. In addition, we continue to improve our operations, with a particular focus on enhancing our end-to-end processes and efficiencies.\nExamples of accelerating and strengthening growth in our segments include the following:\n•\nIntelligent Edge\n- we are seeing continued traction from our investment at the edge including rich software capabilities in security and edge services from HPE Aruba. The Aruba Edge Services Platform (\"ESP\") with Aruba’s built-in identity-based network security is unique in the market and provides the ideal foundation for building a zero trust and secure access service edge. Our comprehensive portfolio and Artificial Intelligence-powered cloud-driven platforms, such as Aruba ESP and Aruba Central, will continue to accelerate WAN and security deployments, advance cloud and IoT adoption and fast-track digital transformation. We are on track to grow high-margin recurring revenue with technology that accelerates our ability to capture the high-growth WAN market opportunity. Additionally, we introduced a new class of cloud-native and fully automated data center switching products specifically designed for edge cloud data centers which represents a significant market opportunity for HPE.\n•\nHPC & AI\n- enterprises are running analytics on increasingly large data sets and are adopting new techniques, such as AI, deep learning, and machine learning. They now will have access to HPC technologies, including exascale supercomputing systems, that were historically prohibitive due to their cost and complexity. HPE GreenLake cloud services is a flexible as-a-service platform that customers can run on-premises or in a colocation facility.\n•\nCompute\n- our strategy to grow profitability and pivot to more as-a-service solutions is paying off. Compute includes three new HPE ProLiant Solutions targeting 5G deployments for telecommunication companies and virtual desktop infrastructure. We launched our new HPE 5G Open radio access network (\"RAN\") solution stack for telecommunications companies to accelerate the commercial adoption of Open RAN in 5G network deployments. This\n33\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nis a transformative technology, featuring the industry’s first server-optimized for 5G Open RAN workloads with our HPE ProLiant Servers.\n•\nStorage\n- we continue to see strength in key software defined solutions, which drive our ability to attach rich services and provide data insights with our portfolio offerings. We introduced a new portfolio of cloud native data infrastructure called HPE Alletra which delivers workload optimized systems and provides customers with architectural flexibility to run any application without compromise, from edge-to-cloud with our operational experience. These innovations are propelling our storage business into a cloud-native software-defined data services business through organic innovation and targeted acquisitions.\nAnnualized Revenue Run-rate (\"ARR\")\nOur pivot to as-a-service continues its strong momentum with the addition of HPE GreenLake Cloud Services. Our mix of ARR is becoming more software-rich as we build our GreenLake Cloud platform, which is improving our margin profile. On the innovation front, we announced a transformative new data storage services platform that brings our cloud operations model to wherever data lives by unifying data operations. The platform will be available through HPE GreenLake Central and include a new data services cloud console and a suite of software subscription services that simplifies and automates global infrastructure at scale. We will continue to invest aggressively in HPE GreenLake Cloud Services to provide a true cloud experience and operating model, whether at the edge, on-premises or across multiple clouds.\nARR represents the annualized revenue of all net GreenLake services revenue, related financial services revenue (which includes rental income from operating leases and interest income from capital leases) and software-as-a-service, subscription, and other as-a-service offerings, recognized during a quarter and multiplied by four. We use ARR as a performance metric. ARR should be viewed independently of net revenue, and is not intended to be combined with it.\nThe following presents our ARR as of October 31, 2021 and 2020:\nThe 36% increase in ARR in fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior-year period was due to growth in HPE GreenLake services and related financial services due to an expanding customer installed base. Additionally, ARR increased due to higher Intelligent Edge as-a-service activity, including Silver Peak, and growth in Storage as-a-service driven by Zerto, a recent acquisition.\nThe following Executive Overview, Results of Operations and Liquidity discussions and analysis compare fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2020, unless otherwise noted. The Capital Resources and Contractual Cash and Other Obligations discussions present information as of October 31, 2021, unless otherwise noted.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nNet revenue of $27.8 billion represented an increase of 3.0% (increased 1.0% on a constant currency basis) due to a variety of factors including improvements in the overall demand environment from the prior-year period resulting in revenue growth across most of our segments, a strong order backlog at the beginning of the period, incremental revenue from the Silver Peak acquisition and favorable currency fluctuations. The revenue increase was moderated by a decrease in unit shipments due largely to industry-wide material constraints and a related challenging supply chain environment which resulted in significantly higher levels of order backlog across our hardware segments at the end of the current period. The gross profit margin of 33.7% represented an increase of 2.3 percentage points due to a combination of factors led by strong pricing discipline, cost savings from our transformation programs and a continued mix shift toward higher-margin software-rich offerings. The operating profit margin of 4.1% represented an increase of 5.3 percentage points due primarily to our strong operational execution in fiscal 2021 and the absence of a goodwill impairment charge which we recognized in fiscal 2020. We generated\n$5.9\nbillion of cash flow from operations (including $2.2 billion of after-tax cash from Oracle Corporation's satisfaction of a judgment in the Itanium breach of contract litigation) due to higher net earnings and improved working capital management. Free cash flow excluding the litigation judgment was $1.6 billion.\n34\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nFinancial Results\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated GAAP financial results:\nNM - Not meaningful\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated non-GAAP financial results:\nEach non-GAAP measure has been reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure herein. Please refer to the section \"GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations\" included in this MD&A for these reconciliations, usefulness of non-GAAP financial measures, and material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures.\nReturning capital to our shareholders remains an important part of our capital allocation framework which consists of capital returns to shareholders and strategic investments. We believe our existing balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, are sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations. As of O\nctober 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $4.3 billion, compared to the October 31, 2020 balance of $4.6 billion\n, representing a decrease of $0.3 billion. We maintain a $4.75 billion five year senior unsecured committed credit facility that was entered into in August 2019. As of October 31, 2021 no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility.\n35\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), which requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. A summary of significant accounting policies and a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our Consolidated Financial Statements are included in Note 1, \"Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, which is incorporated herein by reference. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption it incorporates is subject to material level of judgment related to matters that are highly uncertain and changes in those estimates and assumptions are reasonably likely to materially impact our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEstimates and judgments are based on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis.\nWe believe the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe enter into contracts with customers that may include combinations of products and services, resulting in arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products and/or various services.\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from sales of product and the associated support and maintenance which is recognized when, or as, control of promised products or services is transferred to the customer at the transaction price. Transaction price is adjusted for variable consideration which may be offered in contracts with customers, partners and distributors and may include rebates, volume-based discounts, cooperative marketing, price protection, and other incentive programs.\nSignificant judgment is applied in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration at the time of revenue recognition. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. Variable consideration is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable.\nTo recognize revenue for the products and services for which control has been transferred, we allocate the transaction price for the contract among the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (\"SSP\") basis. We establish SSP for most of our products and services based on the observable price of the products or services when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. When the SSP is not directly observable, we estimate SSP based on management judgment by considering available data such as internal margin objectives, pricing strategies, market/competitive conditions, historical profitability data, as well as other observable inputs. We establish SSP ranges for our products and services and reassesses them periodically.\nTaxes on Earnings\nWe calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in our income tax returns. We will adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on our tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future market growth, forecasted earnings, future sources of taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.  In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.\n36\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nOur effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings and basis differences for which we have not provided for U.S. federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings and basis differences indefinitely outside the U.S. We will remit non-indefinitely reinvested earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries for which deferred U.S. state income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated and when we determine that it is advantageous for business operations, tax or cash management reasons.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and approximately 90 other countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our (Provision) benefit for taxes, Net earnings (loss) and cash flows. Our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany transactions and related interest, and uncertain tax positions from acquired companies. For further discussion on taxes on earnings, refer to Note 6, \"Taxes on Earnings\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired, including in-process research and development (\"IPR&D\"), liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill.\nWhen determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available.\nGoodwill\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test.\nIn the goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and, to a lesser extent, the market approach, with the exception of the Software reporting unit which uses a weighting derived most significantly from the market approach. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on discrete forecast periods as well as terminal value determinations, including revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows. These cash flow projections are discounted to arrive at the fair value of each reporting unit. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital of comparable public companies adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit. We weight the fair value derived from the market approach commensurate with the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or not available, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach. A significant and sustained decline in our stock price could provide evidence of a need to record a goodwill impairment charge.\n37\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nIn addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit.\nOn March 31, 2020, due to the macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic on our projected future results of operations, we determined that an indicator of potential impairment existed to require an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test for its reporting units. The quantitative goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying value of the HPC & AI reporting unit exceeded its fair value by $865 million. As a result, we recorded a partial goodwill impairment charge of $865 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.\nDuring the annual impairment test in fiscal 2020, we determined that no additional impairment of goodwill existed.\nOur annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, did not result in any additional impairment charges. The excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from approximately 8% to 133% of the respective carrying amounts. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit. Based on the results of this hypothetical 10% decrease all of the reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying amount, with the exception of HPC & AI reporting unit.\nAs of the annual test date, the HPC & AI reporting unit had a goodwill of $3.7 billion and an excess of fair value over carrying value of net assets of 8%. The HPC & AI business is facing challenges on the current and projected future results as the revenue growth is dependent on timing of delivery and related achievement of customer acceptance milestones. If we are not successful in addressing these challenges, the projected revenue growth rates or operating margins could decline resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit. The fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit could also be negatively impacted by changes in its weighted average cost of capital, changes in management's business strategy or significant and sustained declines in the stock price, which could result in an indicator of impairment. Further impairment charges, if any, may be material to our results of operations and financial position. See Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" for a discussion of the potential impacts of the pandemic on the fair value of our assets.\nIntangible Assets\nWe review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of our finite-lived intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the finite-lived intangible assets are considered to be impaired. The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. We estimate the fair value of finite-lived intangible assets by using an income approach or, when available and appropriate, using a market approach.\nIn March 2020, prior to the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we tested the recoverability of long-lived assets and other assets of the HPC & AI reporting unit and concluded that such assets were not impaired.\nContingencies\nWe are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies. Significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss, if any, from such contingencies. An accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other updated information and events, pertaining to a particular case.\nBased on our experience, we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingency matters further discussed in Note 17, \"Litigation and Contingencies\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements are not a meaningful indicator of our potential liability. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. We believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2021, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements.\n38\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to represent, a majority of our overall net revenue. As a result, our revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis, which assumes no change in foreign currency exchange rates from the prior-year period and doesn't adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This change in revenue on a constant currency basis is calculated as the quotient of (a) current year revenue converted to U.S. dollars using the prior-year period's foreign currency exchange rates divided by (b) prior-year period revenue. This information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends. This constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a GAAP basis. Other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.\nResults of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue were as follows:\nFiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020\nNet revenue\nIn fiscal 2021, total net revenue of $27.8 billion, increased by $0.8 billion, or 3.0% (increased 1.0% on a constant currency basis). U.S. net revenue decreased by $0.3 billion or 3.4% to $8.9 billion, while net revenue from outside of the U.S. increased by $1.1 billion or 6.3% to $18.9 billion.\nFrom a segment perspective, net revenue increased across most of our segments due to the improved demand environment led by revenue growth of 15% in Intelligent Edge and 5%, 3%, 2% and 2% in Corporate Investments and Other,\n39\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nHPC & AI, Storage, and Financial Service, respectively. Compute net revenue was largely unchanged from the prior-year period.\nThe components of the weighted net revenue change by segment were as follows:\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit margin increased 2.3 percentage points due primarily to a combination of factors led by strong pricing discipline, cost savings from our transformation programs, a continued mix shift toward higher-margin software-rich offerings and favorable currency fluctuations.\nOperating expenses\nResearch and development\nR&D expense increased by $105 million, or 6% due primarily to higher employee compensation expense which contributed 11.0 percentage points to the change. The increase was moderated by cost savings of 4.5 percentage points as we rationalize our R&D through transformation programs by focusing investment in growth areas.\nSelling, general and administrative\nSG&A expense increased b\ny\n$305 million, or 7% due primarily to higher employee compensation expense and unfavorable currency fluctuations, which contributed 4.1 percentage points and 2.1 percentage points to the change, respectively.\nAmortization of intangible assets\nAmortization expense decreased by $25 million, or 7% due to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their amortization in the current period and higher write-offs of certain intangible assets in the prior-year period. The decrease was moderated by an increase in amortizations in the current period resulting from recent acquisitions.\nImpairment of goodwill\nImpairment of goodwill for fiscal 2020 represents a partial goodwill impairment charge of $865 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, as it was determined that the fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit was below the carrying value of its net assets.\nTransformation programs and costs\nOur transformation programs consist of the cost optimization and prioritization plan (launched in 2020) and HPE Next initiative (launched in 2017). The cost optimization and prioritization plan focuses on realigning our workforce to areas of growth, a new hybrid workforce model called Edge-to-Office, real estate strategies and simplifying and evolving our product portfolio strategy. The implementation period for the cost optimization and prioritization plan is through fiscal 2023. The HPE Next initiative was intended to put in place a purpose-built company designed to compete and win in the markets where we\n40\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nparticipate by simplifying our operating model, streamlining our offerings, business processes and business systems to improve our execution. The implementation period for HPE Next was extended to fiscal 2023.\nTransformation costs decreased by $20 million, or 2% due primarily to lower restructuring charges recorded in the current year, with higher IT costs and lower gains on real estate sales in the current period moderating the decrease.\nDisaster charges\nIn fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, disaster charges represent direct costs resulting from the pandemic and are primarily related to HPE hosted, co-hosted, or sponsored events which were converted to a virtual format or cancelled.\nAcquisition, disposition and other related charges\nAcquisition, disposition and other related charges decreased by\n$\n44 million due primarily to lower business acquisition costs related to retention bonuses and integration activities in the current year period.\nInterest and other, net\nInterest and other, net expense was relatively unchanged from period to period, due to offsetting factors with the current period including higher gains from equity investments, lower interest expense from lower average borrowings, and lower unfavorable currency fluctuations, offset by early debt redemption costs, lower gains on the sale of certain assets and lower interest income.\nTax indemnification and related adjustments\nWe record changes in certain pre-Separation tax liabilities for which we share joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which we were indemnified under the Termination and Mutual Release Agreement within Tax Indemnification and related Adjustments. We also record changes to certain pre-Separation and pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables for which we remain liable on behalf of the separated or divested business, but which may not be subject to indemnification.\nWe recorded Tax indemnification and related adjustments income of $65 million and expense of $101 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nTax indemnification and related adjustments in fiscal 2021 primarily included the impacts of a Brazilian Supreme Court decision received regarding the base on which two social contribution taxes in Brazil (\"PIS\" and \"COFINS\") are imposed. As a result of this decision, the Company is entitled to recover credits and associated interest related to the overpayment of these transaction taxes imposed between 2005 and 2019 to be used to offset future Brazilian tax liabilities. As such, we have recorded benefits of $17 million and $80 million, both net of taxes, for the recovery of PIS and COFINS, respectively, during fiscal 2021, of which $25 million was included in Net revenue, $10 million related to interest income was included in Interest and other, net, and $80 million related to pre-Separation liabilities was included in Tax indemnification and related adjustments. The corresponding income taxes of $18 million as a result of this recovery were included in (Provision) benefit for taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\nTax indemnification and related adjustments in fiscal 2020 resulted from changes in certain pre-Separation tax liabilities for which we shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which we are indemnified under the Termination and Mutual Release Agreement and changes to certain pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables.\nNon-service net periodic benefit credit\nNon-service net periodic benefit credit represents the components of net periodic pension benefit costs, other than service cost, for the Hewlett Packard Enterprise defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans such as interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and the amortization of prior plan amendments and actuarial gains or losses. The credit also includes the impact of any plan settlements, curtailments, or special termination benefits.\nNon-service net periodic benefit credit decreased by\n$66 million\ndue primarily to lower expected returns on plan assets.\nLitigation judgment\nIn October 2021, the Company received $2.35 billion which represents Oracle Corporation's satisfaction of the judgment in the Itanium breach of contract dispute. The gain was recognized as other income and presented as a Litigation judgment in\n41\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nthe Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For further discussion, refer to Note 17, “Litigation and Contingencies\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nEarnings from equity interests\nEarnings from equity interests primarily represents our 49% interest in H3C Technologies and the amortization of our interest in a basis difference. Earnings from equity interests increased by $113 million due to higher net income earned by H3C and gains from certain venture investments.\n(Provision) benefit for taxes\nFor fiscal 2021 and 2020, we recorded income tax expense of $160 million and an income tax benefit of $120 million, respectively, which reflect effective tax rates of 4.5% and 27.1%, respectively. Our effective tax rate generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world but may also be materially impacted by discrete tax adjustments during the fiscal year. The jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented include Puerto Rico and Singapore.\nIn fiscal 2021, we recorded $294 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included:\n•\n$180 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges,\n•\n$157 million of income tax benefits related to releases of foreign valuation allowances,\n•\n$39 million of income tax benefits related to tax rate changes on deferred taxes,\n•\n$32 million of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-Separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which we share joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which we are indemnified by HP Inc.\n•\nThese benefits were partially offset by $337 million of net income tax charges associated with income from the Itanium litigation judgment, against which $244 million of income tax attributes previously subject to a valuation allowance were utilized, resulting in a net tax expense of $93 million.\nIn fiscal 2020, we recorded $362 million of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included:\n•\n$174 million of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges,\n•\n$66 million of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-Separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which we shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which we are indemnified by HP Inc.,\n•\n$57 million of income tax benefits related to Indian distribution tax rate changes, and\n•\n$40 million of income tax benefits related to tax rate changes on deferred taxes.\n•\nThese discrete tax benefits were offset by $242 million of net income tax charges related to normal operations and the impact of the Company's goodwill impairment charge being non-deductible from a tax perspective.\nSegment Information\nHewlett Packard Enterprise's organizational structure is based on a number of factors that the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\"), who is the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), uses to evaluate, view and run our business operations, which include, but are not limited to, customer base and homogeneity of products and technology. The segments are based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management to evaluate segment results.\nIn October 2021, we renamed the segment previously known as High Performance Computing and Mission Critical Solutions (\"HPC & MCS\") to High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence (\"HPC & AI\").\n42\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nAs described in Note 1, \"Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we (a) excluded stock-based compensation expense from our segment earnings from operations; and (b) implemented certain organizational changes to align our segment financial reporting more closely with our current business structure. As a result of these organizational changes, our operations are now organized into six segments for financial reporting purposes: Compute, HPC & AI, Storage, Intelligent Edge, FS, and Corporate Investments and Other. The Corporate Investments and Other Segment now includes the A & PS operating segment, the Communications and Media Solutions operating segment, the Software operating segment, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Labs which is responsible for research and development. We reflected these changes in our segment information retrospectively to the earliest period presented, which primarily resulted in the realignment of net revenue and operating profit for each of the segments. These changes had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's previously reported consolidated results.\nA description of the products and services for each segment, along with other pertinent information related to Segments can be found in Note 2, \"Segment Information\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nSegment Results\nThe following provides an overview of our key financial metrics by segment for fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020:\n(1)\nHPE consolidated net revenue excludes intersegment net revenue.\n(2)\nSegment earnings from operations exclude certain unallocated corporate costs and eliminations, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of initial direct costs, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, transformation costs, disaster charges and acquisition, disposition and other related charges.\nCompute\nFiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020\nCompute net revenue increased by $7 million, or 0.1% (decreased 2.0% on a constant currency basis) due primarily to favorable currency fluctuations and an increase in average unit prices. The net revenue increase was partially offset by a decrease in unit shipments resulting from material constraints due to a challenging supply chain environment. As a result, we ended the period with a significantly higher level of order backlog.\nFrom a product perspective, Compute experienced revenue growth in the rack and synergy server product categories partially moderated by a revenue decline due to certain products approaching their end-of-life. Services net revenue was relatively unchanged from period to period.\n43\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nCompute earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 2.6 percentage points due to decreases in costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to favorable currency fluctuations,  lower supply chain overhead costs from operational efficiencies, and disciplined pricing. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to cost savings from our transformation programs partially offset by higher employee compensation expense.\nFiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019\nCompute net revenue decreased by $1.4 billion, or 10.5% (decreased 9.4% on a constant currency basis) due to the impact of the pandemic on the demand environment as we experienced multiple factors including competitive pricing pressures, manufacturing capacity constraints in North America in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and unfavorable currency fluctuations. As a result, Compute experienced a decline in unit shipments and average unit selling prices.\nCompute earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 4.3 percentage points due primarily to an increase in costs of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in cost of products as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to competitive pricing pressures, unfavorable currency fluctuations, higher supply chain costs and the scale of the net revenue decline, partially offset by lower commodity costs and a favorable mix. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due to the scale of the net revenue decline as total operating expenses declined due primarily to lower spending resulting from our cost containment measures and lower variable compensation expense, partially offset by higher field selling costs.\nHPC & AI\nFiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020\nHPC & AI net revenue increased by $83 million or 2.7% (increased 1.8% on a constant currency basis) as the challenges  encountered in the prior year period resulting from the pandemic receded, such as delays with meeting customer milestones, and the demand environment improved. This resulted in net revenue growth in the Apollo and Cray product categories within HPC and growth in Edge Compute. Favorable currency fluctuations also added to the net revenue increase. These increases were moderated by revenue declines in Data Solutions and Services due to certain products approaching their end-of-life and lower support services, respectively.\nHPC & AI earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 1.9 percentage points primarily due to  increases in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to a lower mix of revenue from services and higher-margin Data Solutions, while cost savings from our transformation programs moderated the increase. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to higher field selling costs and employee compensation expense, while cost savings from our transformation programs moderated the increase.\nFiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019\nHPC & AI net revenue increased by $122 million, or 4.1% (increased 4.4% on a constant currency basis) due primarily to higher revenue in HPC from the addition of product and services revenue resulting from the acquisition of Cray, partially offset by a revenue decline in Edge Compute and Data Solutions.\nHPC & AI earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 3.0 percentage points due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue partially offset by lower cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to an improved product mix resulting from Cray. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due to the addition of operating expenses from Cray.\n44\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nStorage\nFiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020\nStorage net revenue increased by $78 million, or 1.7% (decreased 0.1% on a constant currency basis) as we continue our transition to more services, and software-rich offerings. The net revenue increase was led by favorable currency fluctuations, growth in Storage services and incremental revenue from the Zerto acquisition. Net revenue in Storage products was unchanged as growth from HPE Primera products, Traditional Storage and Nimble Storage was offset by revenue declines in SimpliVity and HPE 3PAR, while we are transitioning to the next-generation HPE Primera and HPE Alletra product set.\nStorage earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 1.1 percentage points due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue, partially offset by a decrease in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to a favorable mix of higher-margin HPE Primera and Big Data products, and improved operational efficiencies achieved through our transformation programs, the effects of which were partially offset by higher fixed overhead costs as a percentage of net revenue. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased across all functions due to higher employee compensation expense and planned investments in our cloud data services.\nFiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019\nStorage net revenue decreased by $570 million, or 10.8% (decreased 9.9% on a constant currency basis) due primarily to the impact of the pandemic on the demand environment as we experienced commodity and manufacturing capacity constraints in\nNorth America in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and lower revenue from the expiration of a one-time legacy contract, partially offset by higher revenue from Big Data.\nStorage earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 1.8 percentage points due to an increase in cost of product and services as a percentage of net revenue and an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in cost of product and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to a combination of factors including competitive pricing pressures, increased cost of products due to higher fixed overhead cost, and unfavorable currency fluctuations, partially offset by lower cost of services due to delivery efficiencies. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to the scale of the net revenue decline while total operating expenses declined due to lower field selling costs amid lower spending resulting from our cost containment measures.\nIntelligent Edge\n45\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nFiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020\nIntelligent Edge net revenue increased by $432 million, or 15.1% (increased 12.8% on a constant currency basis) from growth in product and services revenue due to an improved demand environment in the current period, the addition of revenue from Silver Peak and favorable currency fluctuations. The increase in product revenue was led by the Switching and WLAN product categories. The increase in services revenue was led by higher attached support services and increased as-a-service offerings.\nIntelligent Edge earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 3.4 percentage points due primarily to decreases in cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in cost of product and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to lower product costs in Switching and WLAN and addition of higher-margin Silver Peak activity. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to improved operational efficiencies including cost savings from transformation programs, while higher employee compensation expense and the addition of expenses from Silver Peak moderated the decrease.\nFiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019\nIntelligent Edge net rev\nenue decreased by $58 million, or 2.0% (decreased 1.2% on a\nconstant currency basis) due\nprimarily to weak market demand, competitive pricing pressures and unfavorable currency fluctuations. As a result, we experienced lower revenue from WLAN, switching products, and software offerings. These declines were partially offset by an increase in net revenue due to higher service renewals.\nIntelligent Edge earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 4.4 percentage points due to a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue coupled with lower cost of products and services as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in cost of product and services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to a favorable mix of revenue from services and lower costs of switching products, partially offset by higher logistics cost. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to lower spending as a result of cost containment measures, partially offset by higher variable compensation expense.\nFinancial Services\nFiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020\nFS net revenue increased by $49 million, or 1.5% (decreased 0.9% on a constant currency basis) due primarily to favorable currency fluctuations, partially offset by a decrease in rental revenue due to lower average operating lease assets, along with lower asset management revenue from lease buyouts.\nFS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 3.0 percentage points due primarily to lower cost of services as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease to cost of services as a percentage of net revenue resulted primarily from lower borrowing costs while operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue remained relatively flat.\nFiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019\nFS net revenue decreased by $229 million, or 6.4% (decreased 5.2% on a constant currency basis) due primarily to a decrease in rental revenue due to lower average operating leases assets and lower lease equipment buyout revenue, along with unfavorable currency fluctuations, partially offset by higher revenue from lease extensions.\nFS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 0.2 percentage points due primarily to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue, partially offset by lower cost of services as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease to cost of services as a percentage of net revenue resulted from lower depreciation expense and borrowing costs, partially offset by higher bad debt expense. The increase to operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to lower capitalized initial direct costs as a result of adopting the new lease accounting standard.\n46\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nFinancing Volume\nFinancing volume, which represents the amount of financing provided to customers for equipment and related software and services, including intercompany activity, increased by 2.7% in fiscal 2021 and decreased 3.1% in fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior-year periods. The increase in fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by favorable currency fluctuations, along with higher financing associated with third-party product sales and related service offerings. The decrease in fiscal 2020 was primarily related to lower financing associated with both third-party and HPE product sales and related service offerings, along with unfavorable currency fluctuations.\nPortfolio Assets and Ratios\nThe FS business model is asset intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial services companies, including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal management reporting system. The accounting policies used to derive FS amounts are substantially the same as those used by the Company. However, intercompany loans and certain accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe portfolio assets and ratios derived from the segment balance sheets for FS were as follows:\n(1)\nIntercompany activity is eliminated in consolidation.\n(2)\nAllowance for credit losses for financing receivables includes both the short- and long-term portions.\n(3)\nDebt benefiting FS consists of intercompany equity that is treated as debt for segment reporting purposes, intercompany debt, and borrowing- and funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries. Debt benefiting FS totaled $11.9 billion and $11.7 billion at October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and was determined by applying an assumed debt-to-equity ratio, which management believes to be comparable to that of other similar financing companies. FS equity at both October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2020 was  $1.7 billion.\nAs of October 31, 2021 and 2020, FS net cash and cash equivalents were $898 million and $729 million, respectively.\nNet portfolio assets as of October 31, 2021 increased 0.2% from October 31, 2020. The increase generally resulted from favorable currency fluctuations, largely offset by portfolio runoff exceeding new financing volume during the period.\nFS bad debt expense includes charges to general reserves, specific reserves and write-offs for sales-type, direct-financing and operating leases. FS recorded net bad debt expense of $95 million, $93 million and $75 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n47\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nAs of October 31, 2021, FS experienced an increase in billed finance receivables compared to October 31, 2020, which included a limited impact to collections from customers as a result of the pandemic. We are currently unable to fully predict the extent to which the pandemic may adversely impact future collections of our receivables.\nCorporate Investments and Other\nFiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020\nCorporate Investments and Other net revenue increased by $58 million, or 4.5% (increased 2.5% on a constant currency basis) due to favorable currency fluctuations and higher revenue from Communications and Media Solutions (\"CMS\") and Software.\nCorporate Investments and Other loss from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 8.9 percentage points due primarily to a decrease in cost of services and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in cost of services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to service delivery and overhead efficiencies achieved through our transformation programs. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to lower spending resulting from cost containment measures.\nFiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019\nCorporate Investments and Other net revenue increased by $10 million, or 0.8% (increased 1.2% on a constant currency basis) due to higher revenue from Software partially offset by lower revenue from A & PS and CMS, and unfavorable currency fluctuations.\nCorporate Investments and Other loss from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 8.5 percentage points due to a decrease in costs of services and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in cost of services as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to service delivery and overhead efficiencies achieved through our transformation programs. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to lower spending resulting from our cost containment measures.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCurrent Overview\nWe use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. We believe that internally generated cash flows will be generally sufficient to support our operating businesses, capital expenditures, product development initiatives, acquisition and disposal activities including legal settlements, restructuring activities, transformation costs, indemnifications, maturing debt, interest payments, and income tax payments, in addition to any future investments, share repurchases, and  stockholder dividend payments. We expect to supplement this short-term liquidity, if necessary, by accessing the capital markets, issuing commercial paper, and borrowing under credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign financial institutions. However, our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic conditions. We anticipate that the available funds and cash generated from operations along with our access to capital markets will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months. We continue to monitor the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the U.S. and other global economies, the capital markets, consumer behavior, our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A and market risks identified in the section entitled \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" in Item 7A, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n48\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nOur cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with a substantial amount held outside the U.S as of October 31, 2021. We utilize a variety of planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed.\nAmounts held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support our non-U.S. liquidity needs. Repatriations of amounts held outside the U.S. generally will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be subject to state income or foreign withholding tax. Where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is to keep cash balances outside of the U.S. and to meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both. We do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on repatriation of amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs a result of increased uncertainty due to the pandemic, purchases under our share repurchase program previously authorized by our Board of Directors, were temporarily suspended in April, 2020. We resumed our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and settled $213 million of our stock. As of October 31, 2021, we had a remaining authorization of $1.9 billion for future share repurchases. For more information on our share repurchase program, refer to Note 15, \"Stockholders' Equity\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nLiquidity\nOur cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, total debt and available borrowing resources were as follows:\nThe tables below represent the way in which management reviews cash flows:\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.6 billion, for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was due primarily to higher earnings, which includes a $2.2 billion litigation judgment.\nOur key working capital metrics were as follows:\n49\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nThe cash conversion cycle is the sum of DSO and DOS less DPO. Items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ include, but are not limited to, changes in business mix, changes in payment terms (including extended payment terms to customers or from suppliers), early or late invoice payments from customers or to suppliers, the extent of receivables factoring, seasonal trends, the timing of sales and inventory purchases within the period, the impact of commodity costs and acquisition activity.\nDSO measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average of net revenue. For fiscal 2021, as compared to the prior-year period, DSO increased due primarily to a decrease in early payments and factoring, extended payments terms and unfavorable billing linearity.\nDOS measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DOS is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. For fiscal 2021, as compared to the prior-year period, the DOS increased due primarily to higher levels of inventory resulting from a combination of supply chain constraints, positioning of  inventory to fulfill planned future shipments and strategic purchases of certain key components.\nDPO measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts payable by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. For fiscal 2021, as compared to the prior-year period, DPO increased due primarily to higher inventory purchases for planned future shipments and extended payment terms.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $0.2 billion in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. The change was primarily due to higher cash utilized for investment in property, plant and equipment, net of sales proceeds of $0.5 billion and  higher cash utilized in net financial collateral activities of $0.1 billion, partially offset by lower payments made in connection with business acquisitions, net of $0.4 billion.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash generated in financing activities decreased by $4.2 billion in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. The decrease was due primarily to lower proceeds from debt issuance of $4.0 billion, higher cash utilized for debt repayment of $0.4 billion and lower cash utilized for share repurchase of $0.1 billion.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less investments in property, plant and equipment net of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. In fiscal 2021, free cash flow does not include $2.2 billion of after-tax cash impact from Oracle’s satisfaction of the judgment in the Itanium litigation. Free cash flow increased by $1.0 billion in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was due to higher cash generated from operations and improved net working capital moderated by increased cash used for investments in property, plant and equipment, net of sales proceeds.\nOur improved free cash flow outlook and cash position help to ensure we have ample liquidity to run operations, continuing to invest in our business to drive growth and return capital to shareholders.\nFor more information on the impact from operating assets and liabilities to cash flows, see Note 7, \"Balance Sheet Details\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n50\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nCapital Resources\nDebt Levels\nWe maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including acquisitions), share repurchase activities, our cost of capital, and targeted capital structure.\nFor more information on the activity for fiscal 2021 relating to Unsecured Senior Notes and Asset-Backed Debt Securities, see Note 14, \"Borrowings\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nCommercial Paper\nWe maintain two commercial paper programs, \"the Parent Programs\", and a wholly-owned subsidiary maintains a third program. Our U.S. program provides for the issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $4.75 billion which was increased from $4.0 billion in March 2020. Our euro commercial paper program provides for the issuance of commercial paper outside of the U.S. denominated in U.S. dollars, euros or British pounds up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion or the equivalent in those alternative currencies. The combined aggregate principal amount of commercial paper outstanding under those programs at any one time cannot exceed $4.75 billion as authorized by our Board of Directors.  In addition, our subsidiary's euro Commercial Paper/Certificate of Deposit Program provides for the issuance of commercial paper in various currencies of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion. As of October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the Parent Programs, and $705 million and $677 million, respectively, were outstanding under our subsidiary's program. During fiscal 2021, we issued $757 million and repaid $728 million of commercial paper.\nOur weighted-average interest rate reflects the average effective rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the impact of interest rate swaps. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 13, \"Financial Instruments\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nIn December 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to sell, at any time and from time to time, in one or more offerings, debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, depository shares, purchase contracts, guarantees or units consisting of any of these securities.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nWe maintain a $4.75 billion five year senior unsecured committed credit facility that was entered into in August 2019. Loans under the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including support of the commercial paper program. Commitments under the Credit Agreement are available for a period of five years, which period may be extended, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, by up to two, one-year periods. Commitment fees, interest rates and other terms of borrowing under the credit facility vary based on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's external credit rating. As of October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2020, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement.\n51\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nAvailable Borrowing Resources\nAs of October 31, 2021, we had the following resources available to obtain short- or long-term financing if we need additional liquidity:\nFor more information on our available borrowing resources and the impact of operating assets and liabilities to cash flows, see Note 14, \"Borrowings\", and Note 7, \"Balance Sheet Details\", respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nCONTRACTUAL CASH AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS\nIn fiscal 2020 the total of our contractual cash and other obligations was $20.8 billion and in fiscal 2021 totals $17.9 billion. Hence we do not currently expect changes to our contractual cash and other obligations to significantly impact our free cash flow expectations.\nOur contractual cash and other obligations as of October 31, 2021, were as follows:\n(1)\nAmounts represent the principal cash payments relating to our long-term debt, including current portion of long-term debt, and do not include fair value adjustments, discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs. As of October 31, 2021, the future principal payments related to asset-backed debt securities were expected to be $1.2 billion in fiscal 2022, $0.7 billion in fiscal 2023 and $0.2 billion in fiscal 2024. For more information on our debt, see Note 14, \"Borrowings\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n(2)\nAmounts represent the expected interest payments relating to our long-term debt. We use interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure of our fixed rate debt to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates, or hedge the variability of cash flows in the interest payments associated with our variable-rate debt. The impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps at October 31, 2021 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on long-term debt.\n(3)\nAmounts include uncommenced operating leases as of fiscal 2021 and do not reflect imputed interest adjustments.\n(4)\nFor additional information on our Unconditional Purchase Obligations, see Note 19, \"Commitments\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n(5)\nIn fiscal 2022, we anticipate making contributions of $199 million to our non-U.S. pension plans. Our policy is to fund pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by various authorities including local government and taxing authorities. Expected contributions and payments to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows, as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes. For more information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 4, \"Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n(6)\nAs of October 31, 2021, we expect future cash payments of approximately $0.8 billion in connection with our approved restructuring plans, which includes $0.5 billion expected to be paid in fiscal 2022 and $0.3 billion expected to be paid thereafter. Payments for restructuring activities have been excluded from the contractual obligations table, because they do not represent contractual cash\n52\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\noutflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments. For more information on our restructuring activities, see Note 3, \"Transformation Programs\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n(7)\nAs of October 31, 2021, we had approximately $428 million of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions. These liabilities and related interest and penalties include $68 million expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining amount, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters. Payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. For more information on our uncertain tax positions, see Note 6, \"Taxes on Earnings\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nWe have third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers. For more information on our third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements, see Note 7, \"Balance Sheet Details\", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nGAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS\nEffective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company excluded stock-based compensation expense from its segment earnings from operations results and excluded stock-based compensation expense from non-GAAP results. The Company has reflected this change retrospectively to its financial results for the earliest period presented. This change had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's previously reported consolidated GAAP results. However, the Company reflected the change resulting from the reclassification of its stock-based compensation expense by restating its consolidated non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP earnings from operations, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP net earnings per share.\nThe following tables provide reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures for fiscal 2021 and 2020:\n53\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nReconciliation of GAAP net earnings and diluted net earnings per share to non-GAAP net earnings and diluted net earnings per share.\n(1) Represents the amortization of basis difference adjustments related to the H3C divestiture.\nReconciliation of GAAP earnings from operations and operating profit margin to non-GAAP earnings from operations and operating profit margin.\n54\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nReconciliation of GAAP gross profit and gross profit margin to non-GAAP gross profit and gross profit margin.\n(1) Represent charges related to a non-cash inventory fair value adjustment in connection with the acquisition of Cray, which was included in Cost of Sales.\nReconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow.\nNon-GAAP financial measures\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented are net revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue), non-GAAP net earnings, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures are used by management for purposes of evaluating our historical and prospective financial performance, as well as evaluating our performance relative to our competitors. These non-GAAP financial measures are not computed in accordance with, or as an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net revenue on a constant currency basis is net revenue. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit is gross profit. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP gross profit margin is gross profit margin. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP earnings from operations is earnings from operations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue) is operating profit margin (Earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue). The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP net earnings is net earnings. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is diluted net earnings per share. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to cash flow from operations and free cash flow, each excluding litigation judgment, net of taxes paid, is cash flow from operations.\nNet revenue on a constant currency basis assumes no change in the foreign exchange rate from the prior-year period. Non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP gross profit margin is defined to exclude charges related to the amortization of initial direct costs, stock-based compensation expense and certain acquisition, disposition and other related charges. Non-GAAP earnings from operations and non-GAAP operating profit margin (non-GAAP earnings from operations as a percentage of net\n55\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)\nrevenue) consist of earnings from operations excluding any charges related to the amortization of initial direct costs, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, transformation costs, disaster charges, stock-based compensation expense and acquisition, disposition and other related charges. Non-GAAP net earnings and Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share consist of net earnings or diluted net earnings per share excluding those same charges, as well as items such as tax indemnification and related adjustments, non-service net periodic benefit credit, litigation judgment, early debt redemption costs, earnings from equity interests, certain income tax valuation allowances and separation taxes, the impact of U.S. tax reform, structural rate adjustment and excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation. In addition, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share are adjusted by the amount of additional taxes or tax benefits associated with each non-GAAP item. We believe that excluding the items mentioned above from these non-GAAP financial measures allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance in relation to the operating results of our segments. Management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results, and excluding them facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our current operating performance in comparison to our peers. The excluded items can be inconsistent in amount and frequency and/or not reflective of the operational performance of the business.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of the limitations in relying on these non-GAAP financial measures are that they can have a material impact on the equivalent GAAP earnings measures, they may be calculated differently by other companies and may not reflect the full economic effect of the loss in value of certain assets.\nWe compensate for these limitations on the use of non-GAAP financial measures by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement. We also provide a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure. We believe that providing net revenue on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP earnings from operations, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net earnings and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share in addition to the related GAAP measures provides greater transparency to the information used in our financial and operational decision making and allows the reader of our Consolidated Financial Statements to see our financial results “through the eyes” of management.\n56"

    "text": "In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations. Our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. Our risks, risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below.\nActual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change, as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure.\nForeign currency exchange rate risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We transact business in approximately 50 currencies worldwide, of which the most significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal 2021 were the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Chinese yuan (renminbi). For most currencies, we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. Even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency, a weaker U.S. dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures, if taken alone.\nWe use a combination of forward contracts and, from time to time, options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales, operating expenses, and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, when debt is denominated in a foreign currency, we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, consisting primarily of forward contracts, to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. Alternatively, we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with our foreign currency exposures, primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge.\nWe have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2021 and 2020, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at October 31, 2021 and 2020. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of $35 million and $29 million at October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nInterest rate risk\nWe also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued, our investment portfolio and financing receivables. We issue long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing.\nWe often use interest rate and/or currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve U.S. dollar based floating or fixed interest expense. The swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments. However, in circumstances where we believe additional fixed-rate debt would be beneficial, we may choose to terminate a previously executed swap, or swap certain floating interest payments to fixed.\nIn order to hedge the fair value of certain fixed-rate investments, we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns. We may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of interest income received on certain variable-rate investments, by entering into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixed-rate interest returns.\nWe have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2021 and 2020, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover our debt, investments, financing receivables, and interest rate swaps. The analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt, investments, financing receivables, and interest rate swaps. The discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at October 31, 2021 and 2020. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our\n57\ndebt, investments and financing receivables, net of interest rate swaps, of $58 million and $47 million at October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n58"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at October 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated December 10, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n60\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2014.\nSan Jose, California\nDecember 10, 2021\n61\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Zerto, Ltd., which is included in the 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted less than 1% of total assets as of October 31, 2021 and less than 1% and 1% of net revenues and net earnings, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Zerto, Ltd.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of October 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated December 10, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nDecember 10, 2021\n62\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nHewlett Packard Enterprise's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Hewlett Packard Enterprise; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of Hewlett Packard Enterprise are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Hewlett Packard Enterprise; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise's management assessed the effectiveness of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2021, utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Management's evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of Zerto Ltd., which is included in the 2021 consolidated financial statements of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and constituted less than 1% of total assets as of October 31, 2021 and less than 1% and 1% of net revenue and net earnings, respectively, for the year then ended. Based on the assessment by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management, we determined that Hewlett Packard Enterprise's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2021. The effectiveness of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2021 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise's independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report on the preceding pages.\n63\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n64\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n65\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n66\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n67\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity\n68\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(1)\nFor fiscal 2019, includes $\n2.3\nbillion related to an addition to accumulated deficit as a result of the adoption of an accounting standard update for Income Taxes and $\n124\nmillion related to a reduction to accumulated deficit as a result of the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard.\n(2)\nFor fiscal 2020, $\n43\nmillion represents the impact of the adoption of an accounting standard update that allows for the reclassification of stranded tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive loss to accumulated deficit.\n(3)\nFor fiscal 2021, $\n25\nmillion represents the impact of the adoption of the accounting standard on the measurement of credit losses on financing receivables.\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n69\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1:\nOverview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBackground\nHewlett Packard Enterprise Company (\"Hewlett Packard Enterprise\", \"HPE\", or the \"Company\") is a global technology leader focused on developing intelligent solutions that allow customers to capture, analyze and act upon data seamlessly from edge to cloud. Hewlett Packard Enterprise enables customers to accelerate business outcomes by driving new business models, creating new customer and employee experiences, and increasing operational efficiency today and into the future. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's customers range from small- and medium-sized businesses (\"SMBs\") to large global enterprises and governmental entities.\nAcquisition\nIn August 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Zerto\nLtd. (\"Zerto\"), an industry leader in cloud data management and protection for a fair value consideration of $\n416\nmillion. Zerto's results of operations were included within the Storage segment from the date of acquisition. This acquisition expands HPE GreenLake and further enables the shift of the Storage segment toward more cloud-native and software-defined data services solutions. For further discussion on this acquisition, refer to Note 10, \"Acquisitions\".\nLitigation Judgment\nIn October 2021, the Company received $\n2.35\nbillion which represents Oracle Corporation’s satisfaction of the judgment in the Itanium litigation. The gain was recognized as other income and presented as Litigation judgment in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For further discussion on this litigation judgment, refer to Note 17, “Litigation and Contingencies\".\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates in which the Company has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and accounts within the consolidated businesses of the Company have been eliminated.\nThe Company consolidates a Variable Interest Entity (\"VIE\") where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the entity's operation. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company evaluates its power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE by considering the purpose and design of the entity and the risks the entity was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders. The Company also evaluates its economic interests in the VIE.\nThe Company accounts for investments in companies over which it has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not hold a controlling interest under the equity method of accounting, and the Company records its proportionate share of income or losses in Earnings (loss) from equity interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nNon-controlling interests are presented as a separate component within Total stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net earnings attributable to non-controlling interests are recorded within Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and are not presented separately, as they were not material for any periods presented.\nSegment Realignment and Reclassifications\nIn October 2021, we renamed the segment previously known as High Performance Computing and Mission Critical Solutions (\"HPC & MCS\") to High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence (\"HPC & AI\").\nEffective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, HPE implemented certain organizational changes to align its segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure. These organizational changes are: (i) the transfer of the lifecycle event services business, previously reported within the Advisory and Professional Services (\"A & PS\") reportable segment to the Compute, Storage and HPC & AI reportable segments; (ii) the transfer of certain software and related services businesses, previously reported within the Compute, Storage and A & PS reportable segments to the Corporate Investments and Other reportable segment, to form a new Software operating segment; and (iii) the transfer of the remaining A & PS operating\n70\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nsegment, previously reported as a separate reportable segment, to the Corporate Investments and Other reportable segment. As a result of these changes, the Corporate Investments and Other Segment now includes the A & PS operating segment, the Communications and Media Solutions operating segment, the Software operating segment, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Labs which is responsible for research and development.\nAdditionally, effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company excluded stock-based compensation expense from its segment earnings from operations.\nThe Company reflected these changes to its segment information retrospectively to the earliest period presented, which primarily resulted in the realignment of net revenue, operating profit and total assets for each of the segments as described above. These changes had no impact on Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s previously reported consolidated net revenue, net earnings, net earnings per share (\"EPS\") or total assets.\nFor further discussion on the Company's segments, refer to Note 2, \"Segment Information\".\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information, including those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, net periodic benefit costs, restructuring accruals, provision for taxes, valuation allowance for deferred taxes, provision for expected credit losses, inventory reserves, and impairment assessments of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The Company believes that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control. Should any of these estimates change, it could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe Company predominately uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and at historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Net revenue, costs and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies are recorded in U.S. dollars at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the period. The Company includes gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and gains and losses from cash flow hedges in Net revenue as the hedged revenue is recognized. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries designate the local currency as their functional currency, and the Company records the translation of their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date as translation adjustments and includes them as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents was not material for any of the fiscal years presented.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company accounts for a contract with a customer when both parties have provided written approval and are committed to perform, each party's rights including payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collection of consideration is probable.\nThe Company enters into contracts with customers that may include combinations of products and services, resulting in arrangements containing multiple performance obligations for hardware and software products and/or various services. The Company determines whether each product or service is distinct in order to identify the performance obligations in the contract and allocate the contract transaction price among the distinct performance obligations. Arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether the commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. The Company classifies its hardware, perpetual software licenses, and software-as-a-service (\"SaaS\") as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where the Company delivers hardware or software, it is typically the principal and records revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.\nThe majority of the Company's revenue is derived from sales of product and the associated support and maintenance which is recognized when, or as, control of promised products or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled, in exchange for those products or services. Variable\n71\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nconsideration offered in contracts with customers, partners and distributors may include rebates, volume-based discounts, cooperative marketing, price protection, and other incentive programs. Variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available and recognized only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.\nTransfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or once delivery and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term. The Company's hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On its product sales, the Company records consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. Revenue is recorded net of any associated sales taxes.\nThe Company allocates the transaction price for the contract among the performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price (\"SSP\") is the price at which an entity would sell a promised product or service separately to a customer. The Company establishes SSP for most of its products and services based on the observable price of the products or services when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. When the SSP is not directly observable, the Company estimates SSP based on management judgment by considering available data such as internal margin objectives, pricing strategies, market/competitive conditions, historical profitability data, as well as other observable inputs. The Company establishes SSP ranges for its products and services and reassesses them periodically.\nJudgment is applied in determining the transaction price as the Company may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration may include various rebates, volume-based discounts, cooperative marketing, price protection, and other incentive programs that are offered to customers, partners and distributors. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, the Company estimates the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and updates the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. The Company also considers the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable.\nContract Balances\nAccounts receivable and contract assets\nA receivable is a right to consideration in exchange for products or services the Company has transferred to a customer that is unconditional. A contract asset is a right to consideration in exchange for products or services transferred to a customer that is conditional on something other than the passage of time. A receivable is recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional.\nThe Company's contract assets include unbilled receivables which are recorded when the Company recognizes revenue in advance of billings. Unbilled receivables generally relate to services contracts where a service has been performed and control has transferred, but invoicing to the customer is subject to future milestone billings or other contractual payment schedules. The Company classifies unbilled receivables as Accounts receivable.\nContract liabilities\nA contract liability is an obligation to transfer products or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration, or the amount is due, from the customer. The Company's contract liabilities primarily consist of deferred revenue. Deferred revenue is recorded when amounts invoiced to customers are in excess of revenue that can be recognized because performance obligations have not been satisfied and control of the promised products or services has not transferred to the customer. Deferred revenue largely represents amounts invoiced in advance for product (hardware/software) support contracts, consulting projects and product sales where revenue cannot be recognized yet.\n72\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nCosts to obtain a contract with a customer\nThe Company capitalizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, primarily sales commissions, if the Company expects to recover those costs. The Company has elected, as a practical expedient, to expense the costs of obtaining a contract as incurred for contracts with terms of one year or less. The typical amortization periods used range from\ntwo\nto\nfive years\n. The Company periodically reviews the capitalized sales commission costs for possible impairment losses. The amortization of capitalized costs to obtain a contract are included in Selling, general and administrative expense. Refer to Note 7, \"Balance Sheet Details\" for additional information.\nShipping and Handling\nThe Company includes costs related to shipping and handling in Cost of products.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is based on the measurement date fair value of the award and is recognized only for those awards expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions. Stock-based compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock units with only a service condition is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. For stock options and restricted stock units with both a service condition and a performance or market condition, the expense is recognized on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service period of the award. Stock-based compensation expense is determined at the aggregate grant level for service-based awards and at the individual vesting tranche level for awards with performance and/or market conditions. The forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical experience.\nRetirement and Post-Retirement Plans\nThe Company has various defined benefit, other contributory and noncontributory, retirement and post-retirement plans. The costs and obligations for these plans depend on various assumptions. Major assumptions relate primarily to discount rates, mortality rates, expected increases in compensation levels and the expected long-term return on plan assets. These assumptions vary by plan, and the weighted-average rates used are set forth in Note 4, \"Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\".\nThe discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period. Mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the plan. The expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects long-term actual experience and future expectations. The expected long-term return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations, historical portfolio results, historical asset correlations and management's expected returns for each asset class. In any fiscal year, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Historically, differences between the actual return and expected long-term return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation, short-term performance relative to expected long-term performance, and to a lesser extent, differences between target and actual investment allocations, the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations, and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures.\nThe following table provides the impact changes in the weighted-average assumptions of discount rates, the expected increase in compensation levels and the expected long-term return on plan assets would have had on the net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2021:\nThe Company generally amortizes unrecognized actuarial gains and losses on a straight-line basis over the average remaining estimated service life or, in the case of closed plans, life expectancy of participants. In limited cases, actuarial gains and losses are amortized using the corridor approach.\n73\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nAdvertising\nCosts to produce advertising are expensed as incurred during production. Costs to communicate advertising are expensed when the advertising is first run.\nAdvertising expense totaled approximately $\n172\nmillion in fiscal 2021, $\n143\nmillion in fiscal 2020, and $\n188\nmillion in fiscal 2019.\nRestructuring\nThe Company's transformation programs include charges to approved restructuring plans. Restructuring charges include severance costs to eliminate a specified number of employees, infrastructure charges to vacate facilities and consolidate operations, and contract cancellation costs. These restructuring actions require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs, the fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete, and the value of lease and contract cancellation and other exit costs. The Company records restructuring charges based on estimated employee terminations and site closure and consolidation plans. The Company accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements. For a full description of our restructuring actions, refer to our discussions in Note 3, \"Transformation Programs\".\nTaxes on Earnings\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse.\nThe Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers future market growth, forecasted earnings, future sources of taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event the Company were to determine that it is more likely than not that the Company will be unable to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, the Company would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which such a determination was made. Likewise, if the Company later determines that the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized, the Company would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. In order for the Company to realize deferred tax assets, the Company must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.\nThe Company records accruals for uncertain tax positions when the Company believes that it is not more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of adjustments for uncertain tax positions as well as any related interest and penalties. The Company recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and interest expense and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits in (Provision) benefit for taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nThe Company is subject to the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (\"GILTI\") tax in the U.S. The Company elected to treat taxes on future GILTI inclusions in U.S. taxable income as a current period expense when incurred.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts Receivable\nThe allowance for expected credit losses related to accounts receivable is comprised of a general reserve and a specific reserve. The Company may record a specific reserve for individual accounts when the Company becomes aware of specific customer circumstances, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If there are additional changes in circumstances related to the specific customer, the Company further adjusts estimates of the recoverability of receivables. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the use of third-party credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors, the financial condition of customers and the length of time receivables are past due. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment. The past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable. The Company establishes an allowance for expected credit losses related to accounts receivable, including unbilled receivables.\n74\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFinancing Receivable\nThe allowance for expected credit losses related to financing receivables is comprised of a general reserve and a specific reserve. The Company establishes a specific reserve for financing receivables with identified exposures, such as customer defaults, bankruptcy or other events, that make it unlikely the Company will recover its investment. For individually evaluated receivables, the Company determines the expected cash flow for the receivable, which includes consideration of estimated proceeds from disposition of the collateral and calculates an estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts where a loss is considered probable, the Company records a specific reserve. The Company maintains a general reserve using a credit loss model on a regional basis and bases such percentages on several factors, including consideration of historical credit losses and portfolio delinquencies, trends in the overall weighted-average risk rating of the portfolio, current economic conditions, and forward-looking information, including reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company excludes accounts evaluated as part of the specific reserve from the general reserve analysis. The Company generally writes off a receivable or records a specific reserve when a receivable becomes 180 days past due, or sooner if the Company determines that the receivable is not collectible.\nNon-Accrual and Past-Due Financing Receivables\nThe Company considers a financing receivable to be past due when the minimum payment is not received by the contractually specified due date. The Company generally places financing receivables on non-accrual status, which is the suspension of interest accrual, and considers such receivables to be non-performing at the earlier of the time at which full payment of principal and interest becomes doubtful or the receivable becomes 90 days past due. Subsequently, the Company may recognize revenue on non-accrual financing receivables as payments are received, which is on a cash basis, if the Company deems the recorded financing receivable to be fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of the recorded financing receivable, all cash receipts are applied to the carrying amount of the financing receivable, which is the cost recovery method. In certain circumstances, such as when the Company deems a delinquency to be of an administrative nature, financing receivables may accrue interest after becoming 90 days past due. The non-accrual status of a financing receivable may not impact a customer's risk rating. After all of a customer's delinquent principal and interest balances are settled, the Company may return the related financing receivable to accrual status.\nConcentrations of Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, investments, receivables from trade customers and contract manufacturers, financing receivables and derivatives.\nThe Company maintains cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, investments, derivatives, and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are located in many different geographic regions, and the Company's policy is designed to limit exposure from any particular institution. As part of its risk management processes, the Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions. The Company has not sustained material credit losses from instruments held at these financial institutions. The Company utilizes derivative contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Such contracts involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty, which could result in a material loss. For more details on the collateral program, see Note 13, \"Financial Instruments\".\nCredit risk with respect to accounts receivable from trade customers and financing receivables is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the Company's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic regions. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of its customers and may require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain circumstances. As of October 31, 2021 and 2020 no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's receivable from trade customers and financing receivables.\nThe Company utilizes outsourced manufacturers around the world to manufacture company-designed products. The Company may purchase product components from suppliers and sell those components to its outsourced manufacturers thereby creating receivable balances from the outsourced manufacturers. The\nthree\nlargest outsourced manufacturer receivable balances collectively represented\n92\n% and\n89\n% of the Company's manufacturer receivables of $\n947\nmillion and $\n687\nmillion at October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company includes the manufacturer receivables in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis. The Company's credit risk associated with these receivables is mitigated wholly or in part by the amount the Company owes to these outsourced manufacturers, as the Company generally has the legal right to offset its payables to the outsourced manufacturers against these receivables. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in revenue and does not recognize any profit on these component sales until the manufactured products are sold by\n75\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nthe Company, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction to cost of sales. The Company obtains certain components from single source suppliers due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. The loss of a single source supplier, the deterioration of the Company's relationship with a single source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which the Company is supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect the Company's revenue and gross margins.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash is included within Other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and is primarily related to cash received under the Company's collateral securities agreements for its derivative instruments and cash restricted under the fixed-term securitization program for the issuance of asset-backed debt securities.\nInventory\nThe Company values inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. At each reporting period, the Company assesses the value of its inventory and writes down the cost of inventory to its net realizable value if required, for estimated excess or obsolescence. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in future demand forecasts, market conditions, technological changes, product life-cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration, and quality issues. The write down for excess or obsolescence is charged to the provision of inventory, which is a component of Cost of Products and Cost of Services in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nThe Company states property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company capitalizes additions and improvements and expenses maintenance and repairs as incurred. Depreciation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are\nfive\nto\n40\nyears for buildings and improvements and\nthree\nto\n15\nyears for machinery and equipment. The Company depreciates leasehold improvements over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is shorter. The Company depreciates equipment held for lease over the initial term of the lease to the equipment's estimated residual value. The estimated useful lives of assets used solely to support a customer services contract generally do not exceed the term of the customer contract. On retirement or disposition, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets with any gain or loss recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nThe Company capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software, principally related to software coding, designing system interfaces and installation and testing of the software. The Company amortizes capitalized internal use software costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally from\nthree\nto\nfive years\n.\nLeases\nLessee Accounting\nThe Company enters into various leases as a lessee for assets including office buildings, data centers, vehicles, and aviation. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. An arrangement contains a lease when the arrangement conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset over the lease term. Upon lease commencement, the Company records a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lease liability is measured at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments not yet paid over the lease term and the Company's incremental borrowing rate. As most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate which approximates the rate at which the Company would borrow, on a secured basis, in the country where the lease was executed. The ROU asset is based on the lease liability, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received, and the lessee's initial direct costs. Fixed payments are included in the recognition of ROU assets and liabilities, while non-lease components, such as maintenance or utility charges are expensed as incurred. The Company has agreements with lease and non-lease components that are accounted for separately and not included in its leased assets and corresponding liabilities for the majority of the Company's lease agreements. The Company allocates consideration to the lease and non-lease components using their relative standalone values.\n76\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor finance leases, the ROU asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term. Interest expense on the lease liability is recorded separately using the interest method. For operating leases, lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nLessor Accounting\nThe Company's lease offerings are non-cancelable and the payment schedule primarily consists of fixed payments. Variable payments that are based on an index are included in lease receivables. The Company allocates consideration amongst lease components and non-lease components on a relative standalone selling price basis, when lease arrangements include multiple performance obligations. At the end of the lease term, the Company allows the client to either return the equipment, purchase the equipment or renew the lease based on mutually agreed upon terms.\nThe Company retains a residual position in equipment through lease and finance agreements which is equivalent to an estimated market value. The residual amount is established prior to lease inception, based upon estimated equipment values at end of lease using product road map trends, historical analysis, future projections and remarketing experience. The Company's residual amounts are evaluated at least annually to assess the appropriateness of our carrying values. Any anticipated declines in specific future residual values that are considered to be other-than-temporary would be recorded in current earnings. The Company is able to optimize the recovery of residual values by selling equipment in place, extending lease arrangements on a fixed term basis, entering into a monthly usage rental term beyond the initial lease term, and selling lease returned equipment in the secondary market. The contractual lease agreement also identifies return conditions that ensures the leased equipment will be in good operating condition upon return minus any normal wear and tear. During the residual review process, product changes, product updates, as well as market conditions are reviewed and adjustments if other than temporary are made to residual values in accordance with the impact of any such changes. The remarketing sales organization closely manages the sale of equipment lease returns to optimize the recovery of outstanding residual by product.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company includes the results of operations of acquired businesses in the Company's consolidated results prospectively from the date of acquisition. The Company allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired including in-process research and development (\"IPR&D\"), liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquired entity based on their fair values at the acquisition date. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquired entity is recorded as goodwill. The primary items that generate goodwill include the value of the synergies between the acquired company and the Company and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset. Acquisition-related expenses and post-acquisition restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company performs a quantitative test for all of its reporting units as part of its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach, and to a lesser extent, the market approach with the exception of the Software reporting unit which uses a weighting derived most significantly from the market approach. Under the income approach, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows covering discrete forecast periods as well as terminal value determinations. The Company prepares cash flow projections based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The Company bases the discount rate on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, the Company estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. The Company weights the fair value derived from the market approach commensurate with the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or not available, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach.\n77\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nIf the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired. The goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value (not to exceed the total goodwill allocated to that reporting unit).\nIntangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews intangible assets with finite lives, long-lived assets and ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For lease assets such circumstances would include a decision to abandon the use of all or part of an asset, or subleases that do not fully recover the costs of the associated lease. The Company assesses the recoverability of assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is impaired. The Company measures the amount of impairment loss, if any, as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value using an income approach or, when available and appropriate, using a market approach. The Company amortizes intangible assets with finite lives using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging from\none\nto\nten years\n.\nEquity Method Investments\nInvestments and ownership interests are accounted for under equity method accounting if the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not have a controlling financial interest. The Company records its interest in the net earnings of its equity method investees, along with adjustments for unrealized profits or losses on intra-entity transactions and amortization of basis differences, within Earnings or loss from equity interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Profits or losses related to intra-entity sales with its equity method investees are eliminated until realized by the investor or investee. Basis differences represent differences between the cost of the investment and the underlying equity in net assets of the investment and are generally amortized over the lives of the related assets that gave rise to them. Equity method goodwill is not amortized or tested for impairment; instead the equity method investment is tested for impairment. The Company records its interest in the net earnings of its equity method investments based on the most recently available financial statements of the investees.\nThe carrying amount of the investment in equity interests is adjusted to reflect the Company's interest in net earnings, dividends received and other-than-temporary impairments. The Company reviews for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. In such a case, the decrease in value is recognized in the period the impairment occurs in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\nEquity Securities Investments\nEquity securities investments with readily determinable fair values (other than those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are measured at fair value and any changes in fair value are recognized in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. For equity investments without readily determinable fair values, the Company has elected to use the fair value option or apply the measurement alternative, under which investments are measured at cost, less impairment, and adjusted for qualifying observable price changes on a prospective basis. The Company reviews for impairment at each reporting period, assessing factors such as deterioration of earnings, adverse change in market/industry conditions, the ability to operate as a going concern, and other factors which indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. In such a case, the decrease in value is recognized in the period the impairment occurs in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\nDebt Securities Investments\nDebt securities are generally considered available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are calculated based on the specific identification method and included in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company monitors its investment portfolio for potential impairment on a quarterly basis. When the carrying amount of an investment in debt securities exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be due to credit-related factors, the Company recognizes the impairment using an allowance for credit loss in Interest and other, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, while the impairment that is not credit related is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n78\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nDerivatives\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards, swaps, and, at times, options, to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nThe Company receives fair value to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When prices in active markets are not available for an identical asset or liability, the Company generally uses industry standard valuation models to measure the fair value of derivative positions. Such measurements involve projecting future cash flows and discounting the future amounts to present value using market based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, Company and counterparty credit risk, foreign currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices.  In the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. The determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued.\nFor a further discussion of fair value measurements and derivative instruments, refer to Note 12, \"Fair Value\" and Note 13, \"Financial Instruments\", respectively.\nContingencies\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability for contingencies when it believes it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not record gain contingencies until realized. See Note 17, \"Litigation and Contingencies\", for a full description of the Company's contingencies.\nWarranties\nThe Company accrues the estimated cost of product warranties at the time of recognizing revenue. The Company's standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time. The Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers. The estimated warranty obligation is based on contractual warranty terms, repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failure outside of the Company's baseline experience. Warranty terms generally range from\none\nto\nfive years\nfor parts and labor, depending upon the product. For certain networking products, the Company offers a lifetime warranty. Over the last three fiscal years, the annual warranty expense has averaged approximately\n1.3\n% of annual net product revenue. Refer to Note 18, \"Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties\" for additional information.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") amended guidance to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a business combination. Generally, this new guidance will result in the Company recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with those reported by the acquiree immediately before the acquisition date. The Company adopted the guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 retrospectively to all business combinations completed since the beginning of fiscal 2021. There was no material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued guidance to clarify that all derivative instruments affected by changes to the interest rates used for discounting, margining or contract price alignment can apply certain optional expedients and exceptions mentioned in its reference rate reform guidance even though they do not reference to LIBOR or a rate being discontinued. This guidance was effective upon issuance. The Company adopted the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and there was no impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption.\nIn December 2019, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for income taxes. The amendments clarify and simplify the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions to the general principles. The Company adopted the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and there was no material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\n79\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued guidance on a customer's accounting for implementation costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements that are hosted by a vendor. Certain types of implementation costs should be capitalized and amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement. The Company adopted the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and there was no material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued guidance which changes the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and defined benefit pension plans. The Company adopted the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and there was no impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 4, \"Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\" for additional disclosures.\nIn June 2016, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for the measurement of credit losses with additional amendments in 2018, 2019 and 2020. These amendments primarily require the measurement and recognition of current expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. The amended accounting standard replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss model, which requires the use of forward-looking information to calculate credit loss estimates. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. These changes will result in earlier recognition of credit losses. The Company adopted the Current Expected Credit Losses standard (the “CECL standard”) as of November 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective method, with the cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the opening balance of Accumulated deficit within stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cumulative effect of adopting the CECL standard resulted in an increase of $\n28\nmillion to the allowance for expected credit losses within financing receivables, and a corresponding increase of $\n25\nmillion, net of $\n3\nmillion of deferred taxes to Accumulated deficit as of November 1, 2020.\nRecently Enacted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued guidance to increase the transparency of government assistance received by an entity by requiring disclosures relating to accounting policy, nature of the assistance, and the effect of the assistance on the financial statements. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, though early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued guidance to clarify certain interactions between the guidance to account for equity securities, the guidance to account for investments under the equity method of accounting, and the guidance to account for derivatives and hedging. The new guidance clarifies the application of measurement alternatives and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options to acquire investments. The Company is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, though early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the guidance to have a material impact  on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNote 2:\nSegment Information\nAs described in Note 1, \"Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\", effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company implemented certain organizational changes to align its segment financial reporting more closely with its current business structure. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's operations are now organized into\nsix\nsegments for financial reporting purposes: Compute, HPC & AI, Storage, Intelligent Edge, Financial Services (\"FS\"), and Corporate Investments and Other. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's organizational structure is based on a number of factors that the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\"), who is the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), uses to evaluate, view and run the Company's business operations, which include, but are not limited to, customer base and homogeneity of products and technology. The\nsix\nsegments are based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise's management to evaluate segment results. A summary of the types of products and services within each segment is as follows:\nCompute\nincludes both general purpose servers for multi-workload computing and workload optimized servers to offer the best performance and value for demanding applications. This portfolio of products includes the HPE Proliant rack and tower servers; HPE Synergy and HPE BladeSystems. Compute offerings also include operational and support services and HPE GreenLake for Compute as-a-service.\nHigh Performance Computing & Artificial Intelligence\noffers standard and custom hardware and software solutions designed to support specific use cases. The HPC hardware solutions are segmented into several categories, High Performance Computing (“HPC”), Data Solutions, and Edge Compute. The HPC portfolio of products includes the HPE Apollo and Cray products that are often sold as supercomputing systems, including exascale supercomputers. The Data Solutions portfolio (formerly named Mission Critical Solutions) includes the HPE Superdome Flex, HPE Nonstop and HPE Integrity product lines.\n80\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nEdge Compute primarily offers HPE Edgeline products. HPC & AI offerings also include operational and support services and solutions delivered as-a-service through HPE GreenLake.\nStorage\nprovides workload optimized storage product and service offerings which include an intelligent hyperconverged infrastructure (\"HCI\") with HPE Nimble Storage dHCI and HPE SimpliVity. The portfolio also includes primary storage with HPE Primera, HPE Nimble Storage, HPE Alletra and HPE 3PAR Storage for mission-critical and general-purpose workloads, HPE Recovery Manager Central, HPE StoreOnce, HPE Cloud Volumes Backup and Big Data solutions running on Apollo servers. Storage also provides solutions for secondary workloads and traditional tape, storage networking and disk products, such as HPE Modular Storage Arrays (\"MSA\") and HPE XP. Storage offerings also include operational and support services, software subscription services, and solutions delivered as-a-service through HPE GreenLake.\nIntelligent Edge\noffers wired and wireless local area network (\"LAN\"), campus and data center switching, software-defined wide-area-network (from the Silver Peak acquisition), network security, and associated services to enable secure connectivity for businesses of any size. The HPE Aruba product portfolio includes products such as Wi-Fi access points, switches, routers, and sensors. The HPE Aruba software and services portfolio includes cloud-based management, network management, network access control, analytics and assurance, location services software and professional and support services, as well as as-a-service and consumption models through HPE GreenLake for the Intelligent Edge portfolio of products. Intelligence Edge also offers an Edge Service Platform (\"Aruba ESP\") to help customers meet their connectivity, security, and financial requirements across campus, branch, data center, and remote worker environments, covering all aspects of wired, wireless LAN, and wide area networking.\nFinancial Services\nprovides flexible investment solutions, such as leasing, financing, IT consumption, utility programs and asset management services, for customers that facilitate unique technology deployment models and the acquisition of complete IT solutions, including hardware, software and services from Hewlett Packard Enterprise and others. FS also supports financial solutions for on-premise flexible consumption models, such as HPE GreenLake.\nCorporate Investments and Other\nincludes the A & PS business which primarily offers consultative-led services, HPE and partner technology expertise and advice, implementation services as well as complex solution engagement capabilities; the Communications and Media Solutions business (\"CMS\") which primarily offers software and related services to the telecommunications industry; the HPE Software business which offers HPE Ezmeral Container Platform and HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric; and Hewlett Packard Labs which is responsible for research and development.\nSegment Policy\nHewlett Packard Enterprise derives the results of its business segments directly from its internal management reporting system. The accounting policies that Hewlett Packard Enterprise uses to derive segment results are substantially the same as those the consolidated company uses. The CODM measures the performance of each segment based on several metrics, including earnings from operations. The CODM uses these results, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and to allocate resources to each of the segments.\nSegment revenue includes revenues from sales to external customers and intersegment revenues that reflect transactions between the segments on an arm's-length basis. Intersegment revenues primarily consist of sales of hardware and software that are sourced internally and, in the majority of the cases, are financed as operating leases by FS to our customers. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's consolidated net revenue is derived and reported after the elimination of intersegment revenues from such arrangements.\nFinancing interest in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings reflects interest expense on borrowing and funding-related activity associated with FS and its subsidiaries, and debt issued by Hewlett Packard Enterprise for which a portion of the proceeds benefited FS.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise does not allocate to its segments certain operating expenses, which it manages at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include certain corporate costs and eliminations, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of initial direct costs, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, transformation costs, disaster charges and acquisition, disposition and other related charges.\n81\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nSegment Operating Results\n82\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe reconciliation of segment operating results to Consolidated Statement of Earnings results was as follows:\nSegment Assets\nHewlett Packard Enterprise allocates assets to its business segments based on the segments primarily benefiting from the assets.\nTotal assets by segment and the reconciliation of segment assets to total assets as per Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\nMajor Customers\nNo single customer represented 10% or more of the Company's total net revenue in any fiscal year presented.\n83\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nGeographic Information\nNet revenue by country is based upon the sales location that predominately represents the customer location. For each of the fiscal years of 2021, 2020 and 2019, other than the U.S., no country represented more than 10% of the Company's net revenue.\nNet revenue by country was as follows:\nProperty, plant and equipment by country in which the Company's operates was as follows:\nNote 3:\nTransformation Programs\nTransformation programs are comprised of the cost optimization and prioritization plan and the HPE Next initiative. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company launched the cost optimization and prioritization plan which focuses on realigning the workforce to areas of growth, a new hybrid workforce model called Edge-to-Office, real estate strategies and simplifying and evolving our product portfolio strategy. The implementation period of the cost optimization and prioritization plan is through fiscal 2023. During this time the Company expects to incur transformation costs predominantly related to labor restructuring, non-labor restructuring, IT investments, design and execution charges and real estate initiatives.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company launched an initiative called HPE Next to put in place a purpose-built company designed to compete and win in the markets where it participates. Through this program the Company is simplifying the operating model, streamlining our offerings, business processes and business systems to improve our execution. The implementation period of the HPE Next initiative is extended through fiscal 2023. During the remaining implementation period, the Company expects to incur transformation costs predominantly related to IT infrastructure costs for streamlining, upgrading and simplifying back-end operations, and real estate initiatives. These costs are expected to be partially offset by gains from real estate sales.\nCost Optimization and Prioritization Plan\nDuring fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company incurred $\n695\nmillion and $\n384\nmillion, respectively, of charges related to the cost optimization and prioritization plan\nof which $\n690\nmillion and $\n384\nmillion were recorded within Transformation costs, and $\n5\nmillion in fiscal 2021 was recorded with in Non-service net periodic benefit credit in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, the components of which were as follows:\n84\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nHPE Next\nDuring fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred $\n240\nmillion, $\n569\nmillion and $\n462\nmillion, respectively, in net charges associated with HPE Next. For fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, $\n240\nmillion, $\n566\nmillion and $\n453\nmillion were recorded within Transformation costs, and $\n3\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion were recorded within Non-service net periodic benefit credit in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe components of costs relating to HPE Next were as follows:\nRestructuring Plan\nOn May 19, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan in connection with the cost optimization and prioritization plan. As of October 31, 2021, the Company estimates that it will incur aggregate charges of approximately $\n1.3\nbillion through fiscal 2023 in connection with the cost optimization and prioritization plan which relates to labor restructuring and non-labor restructuring, primarily relating to real estate site exits. The changes to the workforce will vary by country, based on business needs, local legal requirements and consultations with employee works councils and other employee representatives, as appropriate.\nOn October 16, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan in connection with the HPE Next (the \"HPE Next Plan\") and on September 20, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a revision to that restructuring plan. As of October 31, 2020, the headcount exits under the HPE Next Plan were complete. The Company estimates that it will incur charges through fiscal 2023, relating to non-labor restructuring, primarily from real estate site exits.\n85\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nRestructuring activities related to the Company's employees and infrastructure under the cost optimization and prioritization plan and HPE Next Plan, are presented in the table below:\nThe current restructuring liability related to the transformation programs, reported in Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 31, 2021 and 2020, was $\n287\nmillion and $\n359\nmillion, respectively, in accrued restructuring, and $\n27\nmillion and $\n24\nmillion, respectively, in Other accrued liabilities. The non-current restructuring liability related to the transformation programs, reported in Other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 31, 2021 and 2020 was $\n180\nmillion and $\n91\nmillion, respectively.\nNote 4:\nRetirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nDefined Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans worldwide, the most significant of which are the United Kingdom (\"UK\") and Germany plans. The pension plan in the UK is closed to new entrants, however, members continue to earn benefit accruals. This plan provides benefits based on final pay and years of service and generally requires contributions from members. The German pension program that is open to new hires consists of cash balance plans that provide employer credits as a percentage of pay, certain employee pay deferrals and employer matching contributions. There also are previously closed German pension programs that include cash balance and final average pay plans. These previously closed pension programs comprise the majority of the pension obligations in Germany.\nPost-Retirement Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors retiree health and welfare benefit plans, the most significant of which is in the U.S. Generally, employees hired before August 2008 are eligible for employer credits under the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Retirement Medical Savings Account Plan (\"RMSA\") upon attaining age 45. Employer credits to the RMSA available after September 2008 are provided in the form of matching credits on employee contributions made to a voluntary employee beneficiary association. Upon retirement, employees may use these employer credits for the reimbursement of certain eligible medical expenses.\n86\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe Company offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The Company's defined contribution expense was approximately $\n170\nmillion in fiscal 2021, $\n160\nmillion in fiscal 2020 and $\n181\nmillion in fiscal 2019. U.S. employees are automatically enrolled in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 401(k) Plan (\"HPE 401(k) Plan\"), when they meet eligibility requirements, unless they decline participation. The HPE 401(k) Plan's quarterly employer matching contributions are\n100\n% of an employee's contributions, up to a maximum of\n4\n% of eligible compensation. Due to cost containment measures put in place in response to COVID-19, the Company suspended the employer match for U.S. employees from July 1, 2020 through the end of the calendar year 2020.\nPension Benefit Expense\nThe Company's net pension and post-retirement benefit costs that were directly attributable to the eligible employees, retirees and other former employees of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 are presented in the table below.\n(1)\nThese non-service components of net periodic benefit cost are included in Non-service net periodic benefit credit in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to calculate the net benefit cost (credit)  in the table above for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n(1)\nThe average assumed interest credited for HPE's cash balance plans and postretirement plans, as applicable.\nTo estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit plans that use the yield curve approach, which represent substantially all of the Company's defined benefit plans, the Company has elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.\n87\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFunded Status\nThe funded status of the plans was as follows:\n(1)\nIncludes the addition/deletion of plans resulting from acquisitions.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2021, the benefit obligation remained flat at approximately $\n14.9\nbillion primarily due to the effects of increasing discount rates offset by increases in long-term inflation assumptions for various plans. Assets returned much better than expected resulting in an increase in pension assets from approximately $\n14.1\nbillion to $\n15.4\nbillion. For the year ended October 31, 2020, the increase in the benefit obligation was primarily attributable to a decrease in the discount rate which resulted in an increase to HPE's pension liability of approximately $\n0.6\nbillion. Assets performed as expected contributing to an increase in pension assets from $\n13.4\nbillion to $\n14.1\nbillion.\n88\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligations were as follows:\nThe net amounts recognized for defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\nThe following table summarizes the pre-tax net actuarial loss and prior service benefit recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the defined benefit plans:\nDefined benefit plans with projected benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets were as follows:\nDefined benefit plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets were as follows:\nFair Value of Plan Assets\nThe Company pays the U.S. defined benefit plan obligations when they come due since these plans are unfunded.\nThe table below sets forth the fair value of non-U.S. defined benefit plan assets by asset category within the fair value hierarchy as of October 31, 2021 and 2020.\n89\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(1)\nRepurchase agreements, primarily in the UK, represent the plans' short-term borrowing to hedge against interest rate and inflation risks. Investments in approximately $\n5\nbillion of government bonds collateralize this short-term borrowing at October 31, 2021 and 2020. The plans have an obligation to return the cash after the term of the agreements. Due to the short-term nature of the agreements, the outstanding balance of the obligation approximates fair value.\n(2)\nIncludes a fund that invests in various government bonds issued by worldwide governments, interest rate swaps, and cash, to match or slightly outperform the benchmark of the future liabilities of the fund. While the fund is not publicly traded, the custodian strikes a net asset value daily. There are no redemption restrictions or future commitments on these investments.\n(3)\nIncludes funds that invest primarily in asset-backed securities, mortgage backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, and/or private debt investments. Primary valuation techniques for level 3 investments include discounted cash flows and broker quotes and/or 3rd party pricing services. Significant unobservable inputs include yields which are determined by considering the market yield of comparable public debt instruments adjusted for estimated losses to reflect where the expected recovery rate would be less than\n100\n%. The yields ranged from\n4\n% to\n17\n%, with the weighted average around\n7\n%. Generally, an increase in yield may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain investments.\n(4)\nIncludes funds, primarily in the UK, that invest in both private and public equities, as well as emerging markets across all sectors. The funds also hold fixed income and derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and inflation risk. In addition, the funds include units in transferable securities, collective investment schemes, money market funds, asset-backed income, cash, and deposits. Primary valuation techniques for level 3 investments include discounted cash flows and book value or net asset value. Significant unobservable inputs include discount rates. The discount rates ranged from\n3\n% to\n25\n%, with the main weighted average around\n7\n%. Generally, an increase in discount rates may result in a decrease in the fair value of certain investments.\n90\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n(5)\nIncludes a pooled fund in the UK, that seeks a rate of return with direct or indirect linkage to UK inflation by investing in vehicles including bonds, long lease property, income strips, asset-backed securities, and index linked assets. Units are available for subscription on the first day of each calendar month at net asset value. There are no redemption restrictions or future commitments on these investments.\n(6)\nHPE Invest Common Contractual Funds (CCFs) are investment arrangements in which institutional investors pool their assets.  Units may be acquired in four different sub-funds focused on equities, fixed income, alternative investments, and emerging markets. Each sub-fund is invested in accordance with the fund's investment objective and units are issued in relation to each sub-fund. While the sub-funds are not publicly traded, the custodian strikes a net asset value either once or twice a month, depending on the sub-fund. There are no redemption restrictions or future commitments on these investments.\n(7)\nIncludes international insured contracts, derivative instruments, and unsettled transactions.\nAs of October 31, 2021 post-retirement benefit plan assets of $\n60\nmillion were invested in publicly traded registered investment entities of which $\n49\nmillion are classified within Level 1 and $\n11\nmillion within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. As of October 31, 2020 post-retirement benefit plan assets of $\n57\nmillion were invested in publicly traded registered investment entities of which $\n46\nmillion are classified within Level 1 and $\n11\nmillion within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nChanges in fair value measurements of Level 3 investments for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans were as follows:\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to measure plan assets at fair value.\nInvestments in publicly traded equity securities are valued using the closing price on the measurement date as reported on the stock exchange on which the individual securities are traded. For corporate, government backed debt securities, and some other investments, fair value is based on observable inputs of comparable market transactions. The valuation of certain real estate funds, insurance group annuity contracts and alternative investments, such as limited partnerships and joint ventures, may require significant management judgment and involves a level of uncertainty. The valuation is generally based on fair value as reported by the asset manager and adjusted for cash flows, if necessary. In making such an assessment, a variety of factors are reviewed by management, including, but are not limited to, the timeliness of fair value as reported by the asset manager and changes in general economic and market conditions subsequent to the last fair value reported by the asset manager. The use of\n91\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\ndifferent techniques or assumptions to estimate fair value could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nCash and cash equivalents includes money market funds, which are valued based on cost, which approximates fair value. Other than those assets that have quoted prices from an active market, investments are generally classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measure in its entirety. Investments measured using net asset value as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.\nPlan Asset Allocations\nThe weighted-average target and actual asset allocations across the benefit plans at the respective measurement dates for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans were as follows:\nFor the Company's post-retirement benefit plans, approximately\n81\n% of the plan assets are invested in cash and cash equivalents and approximately\n19\n% in multi-asset credit investments which consists primarily of investment grade credit, emerging market debt and high yield bonds.\nInvestment Policy\nThe Company's investment strategy is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk depending on the funded status of each plan and the timing of expected benefit payments. The majority of the plans' investment managers employ active investment management strategies with the goal of outperforming the broad markets in which they invest. Risk management practices include diversification across asset classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. A number of the plans' investment managers are authorized to utilize derivatives for investment or liability exposures, and the Company may utilize derivatives to effect asset allocation changes or to hedge certain investment or liability exposures.\nAsset allocation decisions are typically made by an independent board of trustees for the specific plan. Investment objectives are designed to generate returns that will enable the plan to meet its future obligations. In some countries, local regulations may restrict asset allocations, typically leading to a higher percentage of investment in fixed income securities than would otherwise be deployed. The Company reviews the investment strategy and provides a recommended list of investment managers for each country plan, with final decisions on asset allocation and investment managers made by the board of trustees or investment committees for the specific plan.\nBasis for Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the expected returns for each major asset class in which the plan invests and the weight of each asset class in the target mix. Expected asset returns reflect the current yield on government bonds, risk premiums for each asset class and expected real returns, which considers each country's specific inflation outlook. Because the Company's investment policy is to employ primarily active investment managers who seek to outperform the broader market, the expected returns are adjusted to reflect the expected additional returns, net of fees.\nEmployer Contributions and Funding Policy\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Company contributed approximately $\n167\nmillion to its non-U.S. pension plans and paid $\n5\nmillion to cover benefit claims under the Company's post-retirement benefit plans.\n92\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company expects to contribute approximately $\n199\nmillion to its non-U.S. pension plans and an additional $\n2\nmillion to cover benefit payments to U.S. non-qualified plan participants. In addition, the Company expects to pay approximately $\n7\nmillion to cover benefit claims for its post-retirement benefit plans. The Company's policy is to fund its pension plans so that it makes at least the minimum contribution required by various authorities including local government and taxing authorities.\nEstimated Future Benefits Payments\nAs of October 31, 2021, estimated future benefits payments for the Company's retirement plans were as follows:\nNote 5:\nStock-Based Compensation\nOn April 14, 2021 (the \"Approval Date\"), shareholders of the Company approved the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2021 Plan\") that replaced the Company’s 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”). The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of various types of awards including restricted stock awards, stock options and performance-based awards. These awards generally vest over\n3\nyears from the grant date. The maximum number of shares that may be delivered to the participants under the 2021 Plan shall not exceed\n7\nmillion shares, plus\n35.8\nmillion shares that were available for grant under the 2015 Plan as of the Approval Date and any awards granted under the 2015 Plan prior to the Approval Date that were cash-settled, forfeited, terminated or lapsed after the Approval Date. The Company's stock-based incentive compensation program also includes various replacement awards through acquisitions under which stock-based awards are outstanding.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense and the resulting tax benefits were as follows:\n93\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nStock-based compensation expense as presented in the table above is recorded within the following cost and expense lines in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nEffective November 1, 2015, the Company adopted the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\"). The total number of shares of Company's common stock authorized under the ESPP was\n80\nmillion. The ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to\n10\n% of their eligible compensation to purchase Hewlett Packard Enterprise's common stock. The ESPP provides for a discount not to exceed\n15\n% and an offering period up to\n24\nmonths. The Company currently offers\n6\n-month offering periods during which employees have the ability to purchase shares at\n95\n% of the closing market price on the purchase date.\nNo\nstock-based compensation expense was recorded in connection with those purchases, as the criteria of a non-compensatory plan were met.\nRestricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock units have forfeitable dividend equivalent rights equal to the dividend paid on common stock. Restricted stock units do not have the voting rights of common stock, and the shares underlying restricted stock units are not considered issued and outstanding upon grant. The fair value of the restricted stock units is the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date of the award. The Company expenses the fair value of restricted stock units ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse.\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock unit activity for the year ended October 31, 2021:\nThe total grant date fair value of restricted stock awards vested for Company employees in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n271\nmillion, $\n254\nmillion and $\n182\nmillion, respectively. As of October 31, 2021, there was $\n259\nmillion of unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock units, which the Company expects to recognize over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of\n1.3\nyears.\nPerformance Restricted Units\nThe Company issues performance stock units (\"PSU\") that vest on the satisfaction of service and performance conditions. The fair value of the PSUs is the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date of the award. The Company also issues performance-adjusted restricted stock units (\"PARSU\") that vest only on the satisfaction of service, performance and market conditions. The Company estimates the fair value of PARSUs subject to performance-contingent vesting conditions using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The expenses associated with these performance restricted units were not material for any of the periods presented.\n94\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nStock Options\nStock options granted under the Plan are generally non-qualified stock options, but the Plan permits some options granted to qualify as incentive stock options under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The exercise price of a stock option is equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the option grant date. The majority of the stock options issued by the Company contain only service vesting conditions. The Company has also issued performance-contingent stock options that vest only on the satisfaction of both service and market conditions. The Company did not issue stock options in fiscal 2021 and  2020, other than those that were replacement awards through acquisitions in fiscal 2020. The expenses associated with these stock options were not material for any of the periods presented.\nThe Company utilizes the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of stock options subject to service-based vesting conditions. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options subject to performance-contingent vesting conditions using a combination of a Monte Carlo simulation model and a lattice model, as these awards contain market conditions.\nNote 6:\nTaxes on Earnings\nProvision for Taxes\nThe domestic and foreign components of Net earnings (loss) from operations before taxes were as follows:\nThe increase in the foreign earnings from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 was primarily a result of the income from the Itanium litigation judgment.\nThe (Provision) benefit for taxes on Net earnings (loss) from operations were as follows:\n95\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe differences between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and the Company's effective tax rate were as follows:\n(1)\nPositive numbers represent tax benefits and negative numbers represent tax expense as the Company recorded income tax benefit on a pretax loss.\nThe jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on the Company's effective tax rate in the periods presented include Puerto Rico and Singapore.\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company recorded $\n294\nmillion of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included $\n180\nmillion of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges, $\n157\nmillion of income tax benefits related to releases of foreign valuation allowances, $\n39\nmillion of income tax benefits related to tax rate changes on deferred taxes, and $\n32\nmillion of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-Separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which the Company shares joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which the Company is indemnified by HP Inc. These benefits were partially offset by $\n337\nmillion of net income tax charges associated with income from the Itanium litigation judgment, against which $\n244\nmillion of income tax attributes previously subject to a valuation allowance were utilized, resulting in a net tax expense of $\n93\nmillion.\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company recorded $\n362\nmillion  of net income tax benefits related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included $\n174\nmillion of income tax benefits related to transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges, $\n66\nmillion of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-Separation tax liabilities, primarily those for which the Company shared joint and several liability with HP Inc. and for which the Company is indemnified by HP Inc., $\n57\nmillion of income tax benefits related to Indian distribution tax rate changes, and $\n40\nmillion of income tax benefits related to tax rate changes on deferred taxes.\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company recorded $\n152\nmillion of net income tax charges related to items discrete to the year. These amounts primarily included $\n488\nmillion of net income tax charges related to changes in U.S. federal and state valuation allowances primarily as a result of impacts of the Tax Act and $\n40\nmillion of income tax charges related to future withholding costs on potential intercompany distributions of earnings, the effects of which were partially offset by $\n274\nmillion of income tax benefits related to the change in pre-Separation tax liabilities for which the Company shared joint and several liability with HP Inc., and $\n104\nmillion of income tax benefits on transformation costs, and acquisition, disposition and other related charges.\nAs a result of certain employment actions and capital investments the Company has undertaken, income from manufacturing and services in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates through 2037. The gross foreign income tax benefits attributable to these actions and investments were $\n889\nmillion ($\n0.67\ndiluted net EPS) in fiscal 2021, $\n521\nmillion ($\n0.40\ndiluted net EPS) in fiscal 2020, and $\n837\nmillion ($\n0.61\ndiluted net EPS) in fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 16, \"Net Earnings Per Share\" for details on shares used to compute diluted net EPS.\n96\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nUncertain Tax Positions\nA reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nUp to $\n688\nmillion, $\n731\nmillion and $\n772\nmillion of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's unrecognized tax benefits at October 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, would affect the Company's effective tax rate if realized.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and interest expense and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits in (Provision) benefit for taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company recognized $\n17\nmillion of interest expense, $\n10\nmillion of interest income, and $\n13\nmillion of interest income in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had accrued $\n136\nmillion and $\n119\nmillion, respectively, for interest and penalties in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise is subject to income tax in the U.S. and approximately\n90\nother countries and is subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions.\nWith the resolution of the 2013 through 2015 U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") tax audits of its former parent in fiscal 2019, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is no longer subject to U.S. federal tax audits for years prior to 2016\n.\nWith respect to major state and foreign tax jurisdictions, HPE is no longer subject to tax authority examinations for years prior to 2005.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise is joint and severally liable for certain pre-Separation state tax liabilities of HP Inc. HP Inc. is subject to numerous ongoing audits by state tax authorities.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise engages in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. Hewlett Packard Enterprise does not expect complete resolution of any IRS audit cycle within the next\n12\nmonths. However, it is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign and state tax issues may be concluded in the next\n12\nmonths, including issues involving resolution of certain intercompany transactions, joint and several tax liabilities and other matters. Accordingly, Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it is reasonably possible that its existing unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by an amount up to $\n69\nmillion within the next\n12\nmonths.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise believes it has provided adequate reserves for all tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could result from federal, state and foreign tax audits. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of the Company's tax provision. The Company adjusts its uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular audit. However, income tax audits are inherently unpredictable and there can be no assurance that the Company will accurately predict the outcome of these audits. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in the (Provision) benefit for taxes and therefore the resolution of one or more of these uncertainties in any particular period could have a material impact on net earnings or cash flows.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise has not provided for U.S. federal and state income and foreign withholding taxes on $\n8.9\nbillion of undistributed earnings and basis differences from non-U.S. operations as of October 31, 2021 because the Company intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings and basis differences is not practicable. The Company will remit non-indefinitely\n97\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nreinvested earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries for which deferred U.S. state income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated and the Company determines that it is advantageous for business operations, tax or cash management reasons.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting and tax purposes.\nThe significant components of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities were as follows:\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:\nAs of October 31, 2021, the Company had $\n555\nmillion, $\n3.2\nbillion and $\n19.8\nbillion of federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, respectively. Amounts included in federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in years 2030, 2022, and 2022, respectively. Hewlett Packard Enterprise has provided a valuation allowance of $\n171\nmillion and $\n4.4\nbillion for deferred tax assets related to state and foreign net operating losses carryforwards, respectively. As of October 31, 2021, the Company also had $\n6.0\nbillion, $\n6.0\nbillion, and $\n112\nmillion of federal, state, and foreign capital loss carryforwards, respectively. Amounts included in federal and state capital loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2023;\n98\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nforeign capital losses can carry forward indefinitely. Hewlett Packard Enterprise has provided a valuation allowance of $\n1.3\nbillion, $\n181\nmillion, and $\n33\nmillion for deferred tax assets related to federal, state, and foreign capital loss carryforwards, respectively.\nAs of October 31, 2021, Hewlett Packard Enterprise had recorded deferred tax assets for various tax credit carryforwards as follows:\nTotal valuation allowances decreased by $\n356\nmillion in fiscal 2021, primarily as a result of the release of foreign valuation allowances due to sufficient history of income and release of U.S. valuation allowances as a result of foreign tax credit utilization resulting from the Itanium litigation judgment.\nTax Matters Agreement and Other Income Tax Matters\nIn connection with the Separation, the Company entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with HP Inc., which was terminated with the Termination and Mutual Release Agreement in fiscal 2019. Pursuant to that termination, HP Inc. paid the Company $\n200\nmillion in fiscal 2019 and $\n50\nmillion in both fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021. In connection with the Everett and Seattle Transactions, the Company entered into a DXC Tax Matters Agreement with DXC and a Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement with Micro Focus, respectively. See Note 18, \"Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties\", for a description of the DXC Tax Matters Agreement and Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement.\nNote 7:\nBalance Sheet Details\nBalance sheet details were as follows:\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nAccounts Receivable, Net\n99\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable and changes therein were as follows:\nThe Company has third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers. The Company recorded an obligation of $\n65\nmillion, $\n75\nmillion and $\n80\nmillion in Notes payable and short-term borrowings in its Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to the trade receivables sold and collected from the third-party for which the revenue recognition was deferred. For arrangements involving an element of recourse, the fair value of the recourse obligation is measured using market data from similar transactions and reported as a current liability in Other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe activity related to Hewlett Packard Enterprise's revolving short-term financing arrangements was as follows:\n(1)\nBeginning and ending balances represent amounts for trade receivables sold but not yet collected. The ending credit balance as of October 31, 2019 represents credit memos issued but not applied to trade receivables prior to cash remittance.\nInventory\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation expense was $\n2.2\nbillion, $\n2.2\nbillion and $\n2.3\nbillion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n100\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nLong-Term Financing Receivables and Other Assets\nOther Accrued Liabilities\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\nContract Liabilities and Remaining Performance Obligations\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. The aggregate balance of current and non-current deferred revenue was $\n6.4\nbillion and $\n6.2\nbillion as of October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During fiscal 2021, approximately $\n3.2\nbillion\nof d\neferred revenue as of October 31, 2020 was recognized as revenue.\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contract work that has not yet been performed and does not include contracts where the customer is not committed. Remaining performance obligations estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including contract terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, adjustments for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency.\nRemaining performance obligations consist of deferred revenue. As of October 31, 2021, the aggregate amount of remaining performance obligations was $\n6.4\nbillion. The Company expect to recognize approximately\n53\n% of this amount as revenue over the next\ntwelve months\nwith the remainder to be recognized thereafter.\n101\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nCosts to obtain a Contract\nAs of October 31, 2021, the current and non-current portions of the capitalized costs to obtain a contract were $\n64\nmillion and $\n95\nmillion, respectively. As of October 31, 2020, the current and non-current portions of the capitalized costs to obtain a contract were $\n54\nmillion and $\n76\nmillion, respectively. The current and non-current portions of the capitalized costs to obtain a contract were included in Other current assets, and Long-term financing receivables and other assets, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company amortized $\n73\nmillion and $\n58\nmillion, respectively, of the capitalized costs to obtain a contract which are included in Selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nNote 8:\nAccounting for Leases as a Lessee\nComponents of lease cost included in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings were as follows:\nIn fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded $\n3\nmillion and $\n41\nmillion, respectively, of net gain from sale and leaseback transactions.\nThe ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating and finance leases included on the Hewlett Packard Enterprise Consolidated Balance Sheet were as follows:\n102\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term and the weighted-average discount rate for the operating and finance leases were as follows:\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\nThe following tables shows the future payments on the Company's operating and finance leases:\nAs of October 31, 2021, the Company entered into $\n16\nmillion of operating leases that have not yet commenced and are not yet recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These operating leases are scheduled to commence during fiscal 2022 and contain lease terms of\n1\nto\n10\nyears.\nNote 9:\nAccounting for Leases as a Lessor\nFinancing Receivables\nFinancing receivables represent sales-type and direct-financing leases of the Company and third-party products. These receivables typically have terms ranging from\ntwo\nto\nfive years\nand are usually collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Financing receivables also include billed receivables from operating leases.  The allowance for credit losses represents future expected credit losses over the life of the receivables based on past experience, current information and forward-looking economic considerations.\nThe components of financing receivables were as follows:\n103\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nAs of October 31, 2021, scheduled maturities of the Company's minimum lease payments receivable were as follows:\nSale of Financing Receivables\nThe Company entered into arrangements to transfer the contractual payments due under certain financing receivables to third party financial institutions. During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company sold $\n142\nmillion and $\n103\nmillion, respectively, of financing receivables.\nCredit Quality Indicators\nDue to the homogeneous nature of its leasing transactions, the Company manages its financing receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and monitoring credit risk. Credit risk is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the Company's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic regions. The Company evaluates the credit quality of an obligor at lease inception and monitors that credit quality over the term of a transaction. The Company assigns risk ratings to each lease based on the creditworthiness of the obligor and other variables that augment or mitigate the inherent credit risk of a particular transaction and periodically updates the risk ratings when there is a change in the underlying credit quality. Such variables include the underlying value and liquidity of the collateral, the essential use of the equipment, the term of the lease, and the inclusion of credit enhancements, such as guarantees, letters of credit or security deposits.\n104\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe credit risk profile of gross financing receivables, based on internal risk ratings as of October 31, 2021, presented on an amortized cost basis by year of origination was as follows:\nThe credit risk profile of gross financing receivables, based on internal risk ratings as of October 31, 2020, was as follows:\nAccounts rated low risk typically have the equivalent of a Standard & Poor's rating of BBB– or higher, while accounts rated moderate risk generally have the equivalent of BB+ or lower. The Company classifies accounts as high risk when it considers the financing receivable to be impaired or when management believes there is a significant near-term risk of impairment. Effective November 1, 2020, under the new guidance for credit losses, the Company discloses its credit quality by year of origination. The credit quality indicators do not reflect any mitigation actions taken to transfer credit risk to third parties.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses for financing receivables and changes therein were as follows:\n105\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNon-Accrual and Past-Due Financing Receivables\nThe following table summarizes the aging and non-accrual status of gross financing receivables:\n(1)\nIncludes billed operating lease receivables and billed sales-type and direct-financing lease receivables.\n(2)\nIncludes billed operating lease receivables and billed and unbilled sales-type and direct-financing lease receivables.\nOperating Leases\nOperating lease assets included in Property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\nAs of October 31, 2021, minimum future rentals on non-cancelable operating leases related to leased equipment were as follows:\nIf a lease is classified as an operating lease, the Company records lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease term. At commencement of an operating lease, initial direct costs are deferred and are expensed over the lease term on the same basis as the lease revenue is recorded.\n106\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe following table presents amounts included in the Consolidated\nStatement of\nEarnings related to lessor activity:\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company has issued asset-backed debt securities under a fixed-term securitization program to private investors. The asset-backed debt securities are collateralized by the U.S. fixed-term financing receivables and leased equipment in the offering, which is held by a Special Purpose Entity (\"SPE\").  The SPE meets the definition of a VIE and is consolidated, along with the associated debt, into the Consolidated Financial Statements as the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The SPE is a bankruptcy-remote legal entity with separate assets and liabilities. The purpose of the SPE is to facilitate the funding of customer receivables and leased equipment in the capital markets.\nThe Company's risk of loss related to securitized receivables and leased equipment is limited to the amount by which the Company's right to receive collections for assets securitized exceeds the amount required to pay interest, principal, and fees and expenses related to the asset-backed securities.\nThe following table presents the assets and liabilities held by the consolidated VIE as of October 31, 2021 and 2020, which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe assets in the table below includes those that can be used to settle the obligations of the VIE. Additionally, general Creditors do not have recourse to the assets of the VIE.\nFinancing receivables transferred via securitization through the SPE were $\n1.1\nbillion and $\n1.2\nbillion for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Leased equipment transferred via securitization through the SPE was $\n720\nmillion and $\n675\nmillion for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNote 10:\nAcquisitions\nAcquisitions in fiscal 2021\nThe purchase price allocations for the acquisitions described below reflect various preliminary fair value estimates and analysis, including preliminary work performed by third-party valuation specialists, of certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, the valuation of intangible assets acquired, certain legal matters, income and non-income based taxes, and residual goodwill, which are subject to change within the measurement period as valuations are finalized. Measurement period adjustments are recorded in the reporting period in which the estimates are finalized and adjustment amounts are determined. Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to the Company's consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate. Goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, is not deductible for tax purposes.\n107\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Company completed\nfour\nacquisitions, none of which were material, both individually and in the aggregate, to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table presents the aggregate purchase price allocation, including those items that were preliminary allocations and subject to change, for the Company's acquisitions for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021:\nOn August 31, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Zerto, an industry leader in cloud data management and protection. Zerto's results of operations were included within the Storage segment. The acquisition date fair value consideration of $\n416\nmillion primarily consisted of cash paid for outstanding common stock and vested in-the-money stock awards. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $\n214\nmillion of goodwill, and $\n208\nmillion of intangible assets. The Company is amortizing the intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted-average useful life of\nseven years\n.\nAcquisitions in fiscal 2020\nDuring fiscal 2020, the Company completed\ntwo\nacquisitions.\nThe following table presents the aggregate purchase price allocation for the Company's acquisitions for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020:\nOn September 21, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Silver Peak, a Software-Defined Wide Area Network leader. Silver Peak's results of operations were included within the Intelligent Edge segment. The acquisition date fair value consideration of $\n879\nmillion consisted of cash paid for outstanding common stock, pre-acquisition service of the replacement awards, and vested in-the-money stock awards. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $\n561\nmillion of goodwill, and $\n348\nmillion of intangible assets. The Company is amortizing the intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted-average useful life of\nfive years\n.\nAcquisitions in fiscal 2019\nDuring fiscal 2019, the Company completed\nthree\nacquisitions.\nThe following table presents the aggregate purchase price allocation for the Company's acquisitions for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019:\n108\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nOn September 25, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Cray, a global supercomputer leader. Cray's results of operations are included within the HPC & AI segment. The acquisition date fair value consideration of $\n1.5\nbillion consisted of cash paid for outstanding common stock, vested in-the-money stock awards and amount attributable to pre-acquisition service of the replacement awards. In connection with this acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $\n702\nmillion of goodwill, $\n425\nmillion of intangible assets and $\n141\nmillion of in-process research and development. The Company is amortizing the intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted-average useful life of\nfour years\n.\nNote 11:\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill and related changes in the carrying amount by reportable segment were as follows:\n(1)\nAs a result of the organizational realignments which were effective as of November 1, 2020, (described in Note 1, \"Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\"), $\n213\nmillion of goodwill was reallocated from the Storage segment to the Software reporting unit within Corporate Investments and Other as of the beginning of the period using a relative fair value approach.\n(2)\nGoodwill is net of accumulated impairment losses of $\n953\nmillion. Of this amount, $\n865\nmillion related to HPC & AI which was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and $\n88\nmillion related to the CMS reporting unit within Corporate Investments and Other was recorded during fiscal 2018. There is\nno\ngoodwill remaining in the CMS reporting unit.\nGoodwill Impairments\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. As of October 31, 2021, our reporting units with goodwill are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 2, \"Segment Information\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements, with the exception of Corporate Investments and Other which contains three reporting units, Software, CMS and A&PS.\nBased on the results of the Company's interim and annual impairment tests in fiscal 2021, the Company determined that no impairment of goodwill existed.  As of our annual test date, performed at the beginning of the fourth quarter, the excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from approximately\n8\n% to\n133\n% of the respective carrying amounts. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical\n10\n% decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit. Based on the results of this hypothetical\n10\n% decrease all of the reporting units had an excess of fair value over carrying amount, with the exception of the HPC & AI reporting unit.\nAs of the annual test date, the HPC & AI reporting unit had goodwill of $\n3.7\nbillion and an excess of fair value over carrying value of net assets of\n8\n%. The fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit is based on a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach, and to a lesser extent, the market approach. The HPC & AI business is facing challenges on the current and projected future results as revenue growth is dependent on timing of delivery and related achievement of customer acceptance milestones. If the Company is not successful in addressing these challenges, the projected revenue growth rates or operating margins could decline resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit. The fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit could also be negatively impacted by changes in its weighted average cost of capital, changes in management's business strategy or significant and sustained declines in the stock price, which could result in an indicator of impairment.\n109\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nIn addition, should economic conditions deteriorate or remain depressed for a prolonged period of time, estimates of future cash flows for each of the Company's reporting units may be insufficient to support the carrying value and the goodwill assigned to them, requiring impairment charges, including additional impairment charges for the HPC & AI reporting unit. Further impairment charges, if any, may be material to the results of operations and financial position.\nBased on the results of the Company’s annual impairment test in fiscal 2020 the Company determined that no impairment of goodwill existed.\nBased on the results of the Company’s interim impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, it was concluded that the fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit was below the carrying value of net assets assigned to HPC & AI. The decline in the fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit resulted from macroeconomic impacts of COVID-19 which lowered the projected revenue growth rates and profitability levels of the reporting unit. The fair value of the HPC & AI reporting unit was based on the above described methodology for the annual test which was a weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach, and to a lesser extent, the market approach. Under the income approach, the Company estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows which the Company considers to be a level 3 unobservable input in the fair value hierarchy. The Company prepares cash flow projections based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration the historical performance and the current macroeconomic industry and market conditions. The Company bases the discount rate on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, the Company estimates fair value based on market multiple earnings derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. The Company weights the fair value derived from the market approach commensurate with the level of comparability of these publicly traded companies to the reporting unit.\nPrior to the quantitative goodwill impairment test, the Company tested the recoverability of long-lived assets and other assets of the HPC & AI reporting unit and concluded that such assets were not impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment test indicated that the carrying value of the HPC & AI reporting unit exceeded its fair value by $\n865\nmillion. As a result, the Company recorded a partial goodwill impairment charge of $\n865\nmillion in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets comprise:\nFor fiscal 2021, the decrease in gross intangible assets was due primarily to $\n409\nmillion of intangible assets which became fully amortized and were eliminated from gross intangible assets and accumulated amortization, partially offset by $\n273\nmillion of purchases related to acquisitions.\nFor fiscal 2021, the Company reclassified in-process research and development assets acquired of $\n113\nmillion to developed and core technology and patents as the projects were completed, and began amortization. For fiscal 2020,\nno\nin-process research and development assets were completed.\n110\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nAs of October 31, 2021, the weighted-average remaining useful lives of the Company's finite-lived intangible assets were as follows:\nAs of October 31, 2021, estimated future amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets was as follows:\nNote 12:\nFair Value\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe Company uses valuation techniques that are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are developed using market data such as publicly available information and reflect the assumptions market participants would use, while unobservable inputs are developed using the best information available about the assumptions market participants would use. Assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2—Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs.\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to observable inputs and lowest priority to unobservable inputs.\n111\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe following table presents the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nFor the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy.\nValuation Techniques\nCash Equivalents and Investments: The Company holds time deposits, money market funds, debt securities primarily consisting of corporate and foreign government notes and bonds. The Company values cash equivalents using quoted market prices, alternative pricing sources, including net asset value, or models utilizing market observable inputs. The fair value of debt and equity investments was based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using inputs primarily derived from or corroborated by observable market data, and, in certain instances, valuation models that utilize assumptions which cannot be corroborated with observable market data.\nDerivative Instruments: The Company uses forward contracts, interest rate and total return swaps to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. The Company uses industry standard valuation models to measure fair value. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, the Company and counterparties' credit risk, foreign currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and interest rates. See Note 13, \"Financial Instruments\", for a further discussion of the Company's use of derivative instruments.\nOther Fair Value Disclosures\nShort- and Long-Term Debt: The Company estimates the fair value of its debt primarily using an expected present value technique, which is based on observable market inputs using interest rates currently available to companies of similar credit standing for similar terms and remaining maturities, and considering its own credit risk. The portion of the Company's debt that is hedged is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as an amount equal to the debt's carrying amount and a fair value adjustment representing changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligations arising from movements in benchmark interest rates. As of  October 31, 2021, the estimated fair value of the Company's short-term and long-term debt was $\n14.6\nbillion and\n112\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nthe carrying value was $\n13.4\nbillion. As of October 31, 2020, the estimated fair value of the Company's short-term and long-term debt was $\n17.1\nbillion and the carrying value was $\n15.9\nbillion. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, short-term and long-term debt would be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nOther Financial Instruments: For the balance of the Company's financial instruments, primarily accounts receivable, accounts payable and financial liabilities included in other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these other financial instruments would be classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair value: Equity Investments are recorded at cost and measured at fair value, when they are deemed to be impaired or when there is an adjustment from observable price changes. For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no material impairment charges relating to equity investments. For the fiscal years ended October 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized a gain of $\n64\nmillion, $\n19\nmillion and $\n13\nmillion in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, based on observable price changes for certain equity investments without readily determinable fair value. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these would generally be classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nNon-Financial Assets: The Company's non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, goodwill and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at cost. The Company records ROU assets based on the lease liability, adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives received and the lessee's initial direct costs. Fair value adjustments are made to these non-financial assets in the period an impairment charge is recognized.\nIn fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded a ROU asset impairment charge of $\n89\nmillion and $\n74\nmillion, respectively in Transformation costs in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as the carrying value of certain ROU assets exceeded its fair value. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these would generally be classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $\n865\nmillion associated with the HPC & AI reporting unit.  The fair value of the Company's reporting units was classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company-specific information. For more information on the goodwill impairment, see Note 11, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\".\nNote 13:\nFinancial Instruments\nCash Equivalents and Available-for-Sale Investments\nCash equivalents and available-for-sale investments were as follows:\nAll highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents. As of October 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximated fair value due to the short period of time to maturity. Interest income related to cash, cash equivalents and debt securities was approximately $\n18\nmillion\n113\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nin fiscal 2021, $\n44\nmillion in fiscal 2020 and $\n64\nmillion in fiscal 2019. Time deposits were primarily issued by institutions outside th\ne U.S. as of October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2020. The estimated fair value of the available-for-sale investments may not be representative of values that will be realized in the future.\nContractual maturities of investments in available-for-sale debt securities were as follows:\nNon-marketable equity investments in privately held companies are included in Long-term financing receivables and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These non-marketable equity investments are carried either at fair value or under the measurement alternative.\nThe carrying amount of those non-marketable equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative was  $\n253\nmillion and $\n295\nmillion as of  October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the twelve months ended October 31, 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $\n64\nmillion on these investments.\nThe carrying amount of those non-marketable equity investments accounted for under the fair value option was $\n129\nmillion as of October 31, 2021. During the twelve months ended October 31, 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $\n50\nmillion on these investments.\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are included in Long-term financing receivables and other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying amount of such equity investments amounted to $\n57\nmillion as of October 31, 2021. During the twelve months ended October 31, 2021, the Company recorded an unrealized gain of $\n25\nmillion on these investments.\nInvestments in equity securities that are accounted for using the equity method are included in Investments in equity interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounted to $\n2.2\nbillion at October 31, 2021 and 2020. For additional information, see Note 20, \"Equity Method Investments\".\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company is a global company exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of its business. As part of its risk management strategy, the Company uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, interest rate swaps and total return swaps to hedge certain foreign currency, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, equity exposures. The Company's objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts used to hedge them, thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting the fair value of assets and liabilities. The Company does not have any leveraged derivatives and does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The Company may designate its derivative contracts as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation (\"net investment hedges\"). Additionally, for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, the Company categorizes those economic hedges as other derivatives. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The change in fair value of the derivative instruments is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings or Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income depending upon the type of hedge as further discussed below. The Company classifies cash flows from its derivative programs with the activities that correspond to the underlying hedged items in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nAs a result of its use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that its counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of only entering into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors, and the Company maintains dollar risk limits that correspond to each financial institution's credit rating and other factors. The Company's established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and periodically reassessing the creditworthiness of its counterparties. Master netting agreements also mitigate credit exposure to counterparties by permitting the Company to net amounts due from the Company to a counterparty against amounts due to the Company from the same counterparty under certain conditions.\n114\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nTo further mitigate credit exposure to counterparties, the Company has collateral security agreements, which allows the Company to hold collateral from, or require the Company to post collateral to counterparties when aggregate derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds which are generally based on the credit ratings of the Company and its counterparties. If the Company's credit rating falls below a specified credit rating, the counterparty has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives' net liability position. Conversely, if the counterparty's credit rating falls below a specified credit rating, the Company has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives' net liability position. Collateral is generally posted within\ntwo\nbusiness days. The fair value of the Company's derivatives with credit contingent features in a net liability position was $\n3\nmillion and $\n45\nmillion at October 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, all of which were fully collateralized within\ntwo\nbusiness days.\nUnder the Company's derivative contracts, the counterparty can terminate all outstanding trades following a covered change of control event affecting the Company that results in the surviving entity being rated below a specified credit rating. This credit contingent provision did not affect the Company's financial position or cash flows as of October 31, 2021 and 2020.\nFair Value Hedges\nThe Company issues long-term debt in U.S. dollars based on market conditions at the time of financing. The Company may enter into fair value hedges, such as interest rate swaps, to reduce the exposure of its debt portfolio to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving a primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest rate. The swap transactions generally involve principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts. Alternatively, the Company may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if it believes a larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be beneficial. When investing in fixed-rate instruments, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps that convert the fixed interest payments into variable interest payments and may designate these swaps as fair value hedges.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the Company recognizes the change in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company uses forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales, operating expenses, and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company's foreign currency cash flow hedges mature generally within\ntwelve months\n; however, forward contracts associated with sales-type and direct-financing leases and intercompany loans extend for the duration of the lease or loan term, which can extend up to\nfive years\n.\nThe Company uses interest rate contracts designated as cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of cash flows in the interest payments associated with its variable-rate debt due to changes in the U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest rate. The swap transactions generally involve principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, and as long as they remain highly effective, the Company records the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the same financial statement line item when the hedged transaction is recognized.\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe Company uses forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency. The Company records the changes in the fair value of the hedged items in cumulative translation adjustment as a separate component of Equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther Derivatives\nOther derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts used to hedge foreign currency-denominated balance sheet exposures. The Company also uses total return swaps, based on equity or fixed income indices, to hedge its executive deferred compensation plan liability.\n115\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, the Company recognizes changes in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.\nHedge Effectiveness\nFor interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged items with the change in fair value of the derivative. For forward contracts designated as cash flow or net investment hedges, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates.\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nThe gross notional and fair value of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows:\n116\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nOffsetting of Derivative Instruments\nThe Company recognizes all derivative instruments on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements and collateral security arrangements.

This program, which does not have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions.\nOn April 6, 2020, the Company temporarily suspended its share repurchases in response to the global economic uncertainty that resulted from the pandemic. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company resumed its share repurchase activity.\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company repurchased and settled a total of\n14.7\nmillion shares under its share repurchase program through open market repurchases and there were\nno\nunsettled open market repurchases outstanding as of October 31, 2020.

Diluted net EPS includes the weighted-average dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, and performance-based awards.\nThe reconciliations of the numerators and denominators of each of the basic and diluted net EPS calculations were as follows:\n(1)\nThe Company excludes shares potentially issuable under employee stock plans that could dilute basic net EPS in the future from the calculation of diluted net earnings (loss) per share, as their effect, if included, would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented.\nNote 17:\nLitigation and Contingencies\nHewlett Packard Enterprise is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings including those consisting of intellectual property, commercial, securities, employment, employee benefits and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, as part of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. (formerly known as \"Hewlett-Packard Company\") agreed to cooperate with each other in managing certain existing litigation related to both parties' businesses. The Separation and Distribution Agreement included provisions that allocate liability and financial responsibility for pending litigation involving the parties, as well as provide for cross-indemnification of the parties against liabilities to one party arising out of liabilities allocated to the other party. The Separation and Distribution Agreement also included provisions that assign to the parties responsibility for managing pending and future litigation related to the general corporate matters of HP Inc. arising prior to the Separation. Hewlett Packard Enterprise records a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability. Hewlett Packard Enterprise reviews these matters at least quarterly and adjusts these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events pertaining to a particular matter. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. Hewlett Packard Enterprise believes it has recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2021, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been incurred in connection with such matters in excess of the amounts recognized in its financial statements.\n124\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nLitigation, Proceedings and Investigations\nRoss and Rogus v. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company.\nOn November 8, 2018, a putative class action complaint was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara alleging that HPE pays its California-based female employees \"systemically lower compensation\" than HPE pays male employees performing substantially similar work.  The complaint alleges various California state law claims, including California's Equal Pay Act, Fair Employment and Housing Act, and Unfair Competition Law, and seeks certification of a California-only class of female employees employed in certain \"Covered Positions.\"  The complaint seeks damages, statutory and civil penalties, attorneys' fees and costs. On April 2, 2019, HPE filed a demurrer to all causes of action and an alternative motion to strike portions of the complaint. On July 2, 2019, the court denied HPE’s demurrer as to the claims of the putative class and granted HPE's demurrer as to the claims of the individual plaintiffs.\nIndia Directorate of Revenue Intelligence Proceedings\n.\nOn April 30 and May 10, 2010, the India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (the \"DRI\") issued show cause notices to Hewlett-Packard India Sales Private Ltd (\"HP India\"), a subsidiary of HP Inc.,\nseven\nHP India employees and\none\nformer HP India employee alleging that HP India underpaid customs duties while importing products and spare parts into India and seeking to recover an aggregate of approximately $\n370\nmillion, plus penalties. Prior to the issuance of the show cause notices, HP India deposited approximately $\n16\nmillion with the DRI and agreed to post a provisional bond in exchange for the DRI's agreement to not seize HP India products and spare parts and to not interrupt the transaction of business by HP India.\nOn April 11, 2012, the Bangalore Commissioner of Customs issued an order on the products-related show cause notice affirming certain duties and penalties against HP India and the named individuals of approximately $\n386\nmillion, of which HP India had already deposited $\n9\nmillion. On December 11, 2012, HP India voluntarily deposited an additional $\n10\nmillion in connection with the products-related show cause notice. On April 20, 2012, the Commissioner issued an order on the parts-related show cause notice affirming certain duties and penalties against HP India and certain of the named individuals of approximately $\n17\nmillion, of which HP India had already deposited $\n7\nmillion. After the order, HP India deposited an additional $\n3\nmillion in connection with the parts-related show cause notice to avoid certain penalties.\nHP India filed appeals of the Commissioner's orders before the Customs Tribunal along with applications for waiver of the pre-deposit of remaining demand amounts as a condition for hearing the appeals. The Customs Department has also filed cross-appeals before the Customs Tribunal. On January 24, 2013, the Customs Tribunal ordered HP India to deposit an additional $\n24\nmillion against the products order, which HP India deposited in March 2013. The Customs Tribunal did not order any additional deposit to be made under the parts order. In December 2013, HP India filed applications before the Customs Tribunal seeking early hearing of the appeals as well as an extension of the stay of deposit as to HP India and the individuals already granted until final disposition of the appeals. On February 7, 2014, the application for extension of the stay of deposit was granted by the Customs Tribunal until disposal of the appeals. On October 27, 2014, the Customs Tribunal commenced hearings on the cross-appeals of the Commissioner's orders. The Customs Tribunal rejected HP India's request to remand the matter to the Commissioner on procedural grounds. The hearings were scheduled to reconvene on April 6, 2015, and again on November 3, 2015, April 11, 2016, and January 15, 2019, but were canceled at the request of the Customs Tribunal. The hearing was again rescheduled for January 20, 2021 but was postponed and has not yet been rescheduled.\nECT Proceedings\n.\nIn January 2011, the postal service of Brazil, Empresa Brasileira de Correios e Telégrafos (\"ECT\"), notified a former subsidiary of HP Inc. in Brazil (\"HP Brazil\") that it had initiated administrative proceedings to consider whether to suspend HP Brazil's right to bid and contract with ECT related to alleged improprieties in the bidding and contracting processes whereby employees of HP Brazil and employees of several other companies allegedly coordinated their bids and fixed results for\nthree\nECT contracts in 2007 and 2008. In late July 2011, ECT notified HP Brazil it had decided to apply the penalties against HP Brazil and suspend HP Brazil's right to bid and contract with ECT for five years, based upon the evidence before it. In August 2011, HP Brazil appealed ECT's decision. In April 2013, ECT rejected HP Brazil's appeal, and the administrative proceedings were closed with the penalties against HP Brazil remaining in place. In parallel, in September 2011, HP Brazil filed a civil action against ECT seeking to have ECT's decision revoked. HP Brazil also requested an injunction suspending the application of the penalties until a final ruling on the merits of the case. The court of first instance has not issued a decision on the merits of the case, but it has denied HP Brazil's request for injunctive relief. HP Brazil appealed the denial of its request for injunctive relief to the intermediate appellate court, which issued a preliminary ruling denying the request for injunctive relief but reducing the length of the sanctions from\nfive\nto\ntwo years\n. HP Brazil appealed that decision and, in December 2011, obtained a ruling staying enforcement of ECT's sanctions until a final ruling on the merits of the case. HP Brazil expects any appeal of the decision on the merits to last several years.\nForsyth, et al. vs. HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\nThis purported class and collective action was filed on August 18, 2016 and an amended complaint was filed on December 19, 2016 in the United States District Court for the\n125\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNorthern District of California, against HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (collectively, \"Defendants\") alleging Defendants violated the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, California public policy and the California Business and Professions Code by terminating older workers and replacing them with younger workers.  Plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide collective action under the ADEA comprised of all individuals age 40 years and older who had their employment terminated by an HP entity pursuant to a work force reduction (\"WFR\") plan on or after December 9, 2014 for individuals terminated in deferral states and on or after April 8, 2015 in non-deferral states. Plaintiffs also seek to certify a Rule 23 class under California law comprised of all persons\n40\nyears or older employed by Defendants in the state of California and terminated pursuant to a WFR plan on or after August 18, 2012. Following the filing of Plaintiffs' Fourth Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Class Certification on December 30, 2020. On April 14, 2021, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Conditional Class Certification was granted. The conditionally certified collective action consists of all individuals who had their employment terminated by Defendants pursuant to a WFR Plan on or after November 1, 2015, and who were 40 years or older at the time of such termination.  The collective action excludes all individuals who signed a Waiver and General Release Agreement or an Agreement to Arbitrate Claims.\nHewlett-Packard Company v. Oracle (Itanium).\nOn June 15, 2011, HP Inc. filed suit against Oracle in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara in connection with Oracle's March 2011 announcement that it was discontinuing software support for HP Inc.'s Itanium-based line of mission critical servers. HP Inc. asserted, among other things, that Oracle's actions breached the contract that was signed by the parties as part of the settlement of the litigation relating to Oracle's hiring of Mark Hurd. Trial was bifurcated into two phases. HP Inc. prevailed in the first phase of the trial, in which the court ruled that the contract at issue required Oracle to continue to offer its software products on HP Inc.'s Itanium-based servers for as long as HP Inc. decided to sell such servers.  Phase 2 of the trial was then postponed by Oracle's appeal of the trial court's denial of Oracle's \"anti-SLAPP\" motion, in which Oracle argued that HP Inc.'s damages claim infringed on Oracle's First Amendment rights. On August 27, 2015, the California Court of Appeal rejected Oracle's appeal.  The matter was remanded to the trial court for Phase 2 of the trial, which began on May 23, 2016, and was submitted to the jury on June 29, 2016. On June 30, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of HP Inc., awarding HP Inc. approximately $\n3.0\nbillion in damages: $\n1.7\nbillion for past lost profits and $\n1.3\nbillion for future lost profits. On October 20, 2016, the court entered judgment for this amount with interest accruing until the judgment is paid. Oracle's motion for a new trial was denied on December 19, 2016, and Oracle filed its notice of appeal from the trial court's judgment on January 17, 2017. On February 2, 2017, HP Inc. filed a notice of cross-appeal challenging the trial court's denial of prejudgment interest. On May 16, 2019, HP Inc. filed its application to renew the judgment.  As of May 16, 2019, the renewed judgment is approximately $\n3.8\nbillion. Daily interest on the renewed judgment is now accruing at $\n1\nmillion and will be recorded upon receipt. On June 14, 2021, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of the trial court.  Oracle filed a Petition for Rehearing with the California Court of Appeal, which was denied on July 8, 2021.  On July 26, 2021, Oracle filed a Petition for Review with the California Supreme Court. The California Supreme Court denied the petition on September 29, 2021, and the California Court of Appeal issued the remittitur on September 30, 2021. On October 12, 2021, Oracle paid $\n4.66\nbillion, reflecting all amounts owed on the judgment plus accrued interest. Pursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement between HP Inc. and HPE, this amount was split evenly between the parties following the reimbursement of approximately $\n48\nmillion in pre-separation legal costs incurred by HPE in prosecution of the litigation. In total, HPE has received payment of approximately $\n2.35\nbillion. On October 27, 2021, HP Inc. filed an acknowledgement of full satisfaction of judgment. Oracle has until December 28, 2021 to file a petition for certiorari asking the United States Supreme Court for review. Review by the United States Supreme Court is discretionary, and we believe the likelihood the award of damages will be reduced or reversed is remote.\nOracle America, Inc., et al. v. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (Terix copyright matter)\n.\nOn March 22, 2016, Oracle filed a complaint against HPE in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging copyright infringement, interference with contract, intentional interference with prospective economic relations, and unfair competition. Oracle’s claims arise out of HPE's prior use of a third-party maintenance provider named Terix Computer Company, Inc. (\"Terix\"). Oracle contends that in connection with HPE's use of Terix as a subcontractor for certain customers of HPE's multivendor support business, Oracle's copyrights were infringed, and HPE is liable for vicarious and contributory infringement and related claims. The lawsuit against HPE follows a prior lawsuit brought by Oracle against Terix in 2013 relating to Terix's alleged unauthorized provision of Solaris patches to customers on Oracle hardware. On January 29, 2019, the court granted HPE's Motion for Summary Judgment as to all of Oracle's claims. On February 20, 2019, the court entered judgment in favor of HPE, dismissing Oracle's claims in their entirety.  Oracle appealed the trial court's ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  On August 20, 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued its ruling, affirming in part and reversing in part the trial court's decision granting summary judgment in favor of HPE. On October 6, 2020, the matter was remanded to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. On\n126\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nJune 4, 2021, the Court issued an order denying HPE’s motion for summary judgment and granting-in-part Oracle’s motion for partial summary judgment as to a certain of HPE’s defenses.  The Court has rescheduled the start of trial to May 23, 2022.\nNetwork-1 Technologies, Inc. v. Alcatel-Lucent USA Inc., et al.\nThis patent infringement action was filed on September 15, 2011 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that various Hewlett Packard Enterprise switches and access points infringe Network-1's patent relating to the 802.3af and 802.3at \"Power over Ethernet\" standards. Network-1 seeks damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and declaratory and injunctive relief. A jury trial was conducted beginning on November 6, 2017. On November 13, 2017, the jury returned a verdict in favor of HPE, finding that HPE did not infringe Network-1's patent and that the patent was invalid. On August 29, 2018, the court denied Network-1's motion for a new trial on infringement and entered the jury's verdict finding that HPE does not infringe the relevant Network-1 patent. The court also granted Network-1's motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law on validity. Network-1 appealed the jury verdict of non-infringement to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. HPE cross-appealed the court's decision to grant Network-1's motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law on validity. On September 24, 2020, the Federal Circuit issued its ruling, affirming-in-part and reversing-in-part the jury's verdict, and finding that an erroneous claim construction was presented to the jury that prejudiced Network-1. The matter has been remanded back to United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas for further proceedings consistent with the Federal Circuit's ruling. On May 7, 2021, the District Court issued an order granting Network-1's motion for a new trial. The parties have agreed to the terms of a settlement that resolves the litigation with no material financial statements impact. The lawsuit was dismissed on August 13, 2021 and the matter is now closed.\nQ3 Networking Litigation.\nOn September 21 and September 22, 2020, Q3 Networking LLC filed complaints against HPE, Aruba Networks, Commscope and Netgear in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and the United States International Trade Commission (“ITC”). Both complaints allege infringement of\nfour\npatents, and the ITC complaint defines the “accused products” as “routers, access points, controllers, network management servers, other networking products, and hardware and software components thereof.” The ITC action was instituted on October 23, 2020. The District of Delaware action has been stayed pending resolution of the ITC action. The evidentiary hearing before the ITC has been completed. On December 7, 2021, the Administrative Law Judge issued his initial determination finding no violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act.  A public version of the initial determination will be available by January 7, 2022. The ITC must decide whether to adopt the Administrative Law Judge’s findings or grant review of the initial determination no later than February 7, 2022.\nShared Litigation with HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus\nAs part of the Separation and Distribution Agreements between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise and DXC, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Seattle SpinCo, the parties to each agreement agreed to cooperate with each other in managing certain existing litigation related to both parties' businesses. The Separation and Distribution Agreements also included provisions that assign to the parties responsibility for managing pending and future litigation related to the general corporate matters of HP Inc. (in the case of the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise from HP Inc.) or of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (in the case of the separation of DXC from Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the separation of Seattle SpinCo from Hewlett Packard Enterprise), in each case arising prior to the applicable separation.\nEnvironmental\nThe Company's operations and products are or may in the future become subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the clean-up of contaminated sites, the substances and materials used in the Company's products, the energy consumption of products, services and operations and the operational or financial responsibility for recycling, treatment and disposal of those products. This includes legislation that makes producers of electrical goods, including servers and networking equipment, financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as \"product take-back legislation\"). The Company could incur substantial costs, its products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions, and it could face other sanctions, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws, including those related to addressing climate change and other environmental, social, and governance-related issues, or if its products become non-compliant with such environmental laws. The Company's potential exposure includes impacts on revenue, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims and clean-up costs. The amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict.\nIn particular, the Company may become a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"), known as \"Superfund,\" or other federal, state or foreign laws and regulations addressing the clean-up of contaminated sites, and\n127\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nmay become a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by private parties for contribution towards clean-up costs. The Company is also contractually obligated to make financial contributions to address actions related to certain environmental liabilities, both ongoing and arising in the future, pursuant to its Separation and Distribution Agreement with HP Inc.\nNote 18:\nGuarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties\nGuarantees\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company may issue performance guarantees to certain of its clients, customers and other parties pursuant to which the Company has guaranteed the performance obligations of third parties. Some of those guarantees may be backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds. In general, the Company would be obligated to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event a specified triggering event occurs as defined by the guarantee. The Company believes the likelihood of having to perform under a material guarantee is remote.\nThe Company has entered into service contracts with certain of its clients that are supported by financing arrangements. If a service contract is terminated as a result of the Company's non-performance under the contract or failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, the Company could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract. The Company believes the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets under these arrangements is remote.\nIndemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under which the Company may agree to indemnify a third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of the Company or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. The Company also provides indemnifications to certain vendors and customers against claims of IP infringement made by third parties arising from the use by such vendors and customers of the Company's software products and support services and certain other matters. Some indemnifications may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.\nGeneral Cross-indemnification\nIn connection with the Separation, Everett and Seattle transactions, the Company entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement with HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus respectively, whereby the Company agreed to indemnify HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus, each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to the Company as part of the Separation, Everett and Seattle transactions. Similarly, HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus agreed to indemnify the Company, each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all claims and liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to HP Inc., DXC and Micro Focus  as part of the Separation, Everett and Seattle transactions.\nTax Matters Agreement with DXC/Micro Focus and Other Income Tax Matters\nIn connection with the Everett Transaction and the Seattle Transaction, the Company entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with DXC and Micro Focus respectively (the \"DXC Tax Matters Agreement\" and the \"Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement\").  The DXC Tax Matters Agreement and the Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement govern the rights and obligations of the Company and DXC/Micro Focus for certain pre-divestiture tax liabilities and tax receivables. The DXC Tax Matters Agreement and the Micro Focus Tax Matters Agreement generally provide that the Company will be responsible for pre-divestiture tax liabilities and will be entitled to pre-divestiture tax receivables that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to the Company's and DXC's, or Micro Focus', as applicable, U.S. and certain non-U.S. tax returns. In certain jurisdictions, the Company and DXC/Micro Focus have joint and several liability for past tax liabilities and accordingly, the Company could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments.\nIn addition, if the distribution of Everett's or Seattle's common shares to Hewlett Packard Enterprise's stockholders is determined to be taxable, the Company would generally bear the tax liability, unless the taxability of the distribution is the direct result of actions taken by DXC/Micro Focus, in which case DXC/Micro Focus would be responsible for any taxes imposed on the distribution.\n128\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nAs of October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's receivable and payable balances related to indemnified litigation matters and other contingencies, and income tax-related indemnification covered by these agreements were as follows:\n(1)\nThe actual amount that the Company may receive or pay could vary depending upon the outcome of certain unresolved tax matters, which may not be resolved for several years.\nWarranties\nThe Company's aggregate product warranty liabilities and changes therein were as follows:\n(1)\nThe Company includes the current portion in Other accrued liabilities, and amounts due after one year in Other non-current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNote 19:\nCommitments\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nAs of October 31, 2021, the Company had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately $\n768\nmillion. These unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction, as well as settlements that the Company has reached with third parties, requiring it to pay determined amounts over a specified period of time. These unconditional purchase obligations are related principally to inventory purchase, software maintenance and support services and other items. Unconditional purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty.\n129\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nAs of October 31, 2021, future unconditional purchase obligations were as follows:\nNote 20:\nEquity Method Investments\nThe Company includes investments which are accounted for using the equity method, under Investments in equity interests on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2020, the Company's Investments in equity interests were $\n2.2\nbillion and primarily related to a\n49\n% equity interest in H3C Technologies (\"H3C\").\nIn the periods presented, the Company recorded its interest in the net earnings of H3C along with an adjustment to eliminate unrealized profits on intra-entity sales, and the amortization of basis difference, within Earnings from equity interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nThe difference between the sale date carrying value of the Company's investment in H3C and its proportionate share of the net assets fair value of H3C, created a basis difference of $\n2.5\nbillion, which was allocated as follows:\nThe Company amortizes the basis difference over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to this difference. The weighted-average life of the H3C intangible assets is\nfive years\nand is being amortized using the straight-line method. As of October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company determined that\nno\nimpairment of its equity method investments existed.\nEarnings from equity interest\nThe Company recorded earnings from equity interests of $\n180\nmillion, $\n67\nmillion and $\n20\nmillion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, the components of which are as follows:\n(1) In fiscal 2021, earnings from equity interests, net of taxes included $\n260\nmillion from H3C and $\n32\nmillion from other venture investments.\n130\nHEWLETT PACKARD ENTERPRISE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nDuring fiscals 2021 and 2020, the Company received a cash dividend of $\n184\nmillion and $\n165\nmillion, respectively, from H3C. This amount was accounted for as a return on investment and reflected as a reduction in the carrying balance of the Company's Investments in equity interests in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company also has commercial arrangements with H3C to buy and sell HPE branded servers, storage and networking products and services. During fiscals 2021, 2020 and 2019, HPE recorded approximately $\n794\nmillion, $\n737\nmillion and $\n897\nmillion of sales to H3C and $\n150\nmillion, $\n215\nmillion and $\n202\nmillion of purchases from H3C, respectively. Payables due to H3C as of October 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $\n32\nmillion and $\n29\nmillion, respectively. Receivables due from H3C as of  October 31, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $\n70\nmillion and $\n19\nmillion, respectively.\n131"

    "text": "Effective December 8, 2021, HPE and Keerti Melkote, former President of HPE's Intelligent Edge business unit, entered into a retirement agreement (the “Agreement”) that amended Mr. Melkote’s outstanding restricted stock unit (“RSU”) award agreements to provide that the underlying RSU awards shall be eligible to continue vesting on their current vesting schedule after Mr. Melkote’s December 31, 2021 retirement, subject to (i) all existing performance vesting criteria for performance-adjusted RSUs, (ii) Mr. Melkote’s entry into a standard release of claims and (iii) Mr. Melkote’s ongoing adherence to standard non-competition and non-solicitation covenants for the duration of the RSU awards’ vesting schedule.\nThe foregoing description of the Agreement is qualified entirely by the Agreement itself, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.32 and incorporated by reference herein.\nThe following disclosure is being made under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act:\nOn March 2, 2021, the U.S. Secretary of State designated the Russian Federal Security Service (“FSB”) as a party subject to the provisions of U.S. Executive Order No. 13382 issued in 2005 (“Executive Order 13382”). On the same day, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control updated General License 1B (“General License 1B”) which generally authorizes U.S. companies to engage in certain licensing, permitting, certification, notification and related transactions with the FSB as may be required for the importation, distribution or use of information technology products in the Russian Federation. Our local subsidiary is required to engage on a regular basis with the FSB as a licensing authority and file documents in order to conduct business within the Russian Federation. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB and all such dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B. We plan to continue these activities as required to continue to conduct business in the Russian Federation to the extent permitted by applicable law.\nOn April 15, 2021, the U.S. Government issued an executive order on Blocking Property with Respect to Specified Harmful Foreign Activities of the Government of the Russian Federation (“Executive Order 14024”), implementing additional U.S. sanctions against the Russian government and against Russian actors that threaten U.S. interests, including certain technology companies that support the Russian Intelligence Service. The U.S. Secretary of the Treasury designated Pozitiv\n132\nTeknolodzhiz, AO (“Positive Technologies”) under Executive Order 14024 and Executive Order 13382. Prior to its designation, HPE’s local Russian subsidiary, occasionally through distributors and resellers, had sold equipment to and entered into service contracts with Positive Technologies. HPE’s local subsidiary had also entered into an original equipment manufacturing agreement with Positive Technologies and approved it as a reseller. Following the sanctions designation, our local subsidiary immediately initiated procedures to terminate its relationship with Positive Technologies. HPE does not plan to engage in any further transactions with this entity, except wind down activities that are authorized by OFAC going forward. In fiscal 2021, the total cash received, excluding sales tax, from our business with Positive Technologies since its designation was $33,412, of which $1,755 has been recognized as revenue and the remaining $31,657 has been recorded as deferred revenue. There are no identifiable net profits associated with HPE’s relationship with Positive Technologies for this reporting period.\nFor a summary of our revenue recognition policies, see \"Revenue Recognition\" described in Note 1, \"Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n133\nPART III"
