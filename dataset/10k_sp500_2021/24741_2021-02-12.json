    "text": "We operate in rapidly changing economic, political, and technological environments that present numerous risks.  Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, our ability to successfully execute our Strategy & Growth Framework and the trading price of our common stock or debt.  The following discussion identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.  This information should be read in conjunction with our MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report.  The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider, as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements and from historical trends.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has, and may continue to, adversely impact the global economy and disrupt our operations and supply chains, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCOVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the global economy and could have additional impacts on economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates.\nThe pandemic has resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures such as travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and facility shutdowns. These measures have impacted, and may continue to impact our workforce and operations, and those of our customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers, particularly in the event of a significant global resurgence of the illness. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic and the impacts on our business and the global economy from the effects of the ongoing pandemic and response measures.\n14\nCorning’s Display Technologies segment generates a significant amount of the Company’s profits and cash flow.  Any significant decrease in display glass pricing or market share could have a material and negative impact on our financial results\nCorning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely on the profitability of our\ndisplay glass business, which is subject to continuous\npricing pressure due to industry competition, potential over-capacity, and development of new technologies.  If we are not able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs and increases in volume to offset ongoing pricing pressure it\ncould have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nBecause we have a concentrated customer base in each of our businesses, our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or insolvency of one or more key customers, as well as our ability to retain these customers\nA relatively small number of end customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in each of our reportable segments.  This concentration subjects us to a variety of risks including:\n\nLower sales and cash flow that could result from the loss of one or more of our key customers;\n\nMergers and consolidations between customers could result in further concentration of Corning’s customer base;\n\nThe loss or insolvency of a key customer, could result in a substantial loss of sales and reduction in anticipated cash flows; and\n\nCustomers may possess substantial leverage in negotiating contractual obligations, including liability provisions.\nThe following table details the number of combined customers of our segments that accounted for a large percentage of segment net sales:\nEvents outside of Corning’s control, could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Corning’s net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity\nDisruption to our manufacturing operations could significantly impact Corning’s ability to supply its customers and could produce a near-term severe impact on our individual businesses and the Company as a whole. Given the geographical concentration of certain of our plants, the highly engineered nature of our facilities and the globally dispersed talent required to run these facilities, any event that adversely affects or restricts movement into or out of a specific geographic area where we, our suppliers, or our customers have a presence, could adversely impact our results. Due to the specialized nature of the assets and certain single-site manufacturing locations, in the event such a location experiences disruption, it may not be possible to find replacement capacity or substitute production from other facilities.\n15\nWe may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others\nWe rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights.  Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses.  We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors.  Changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share.  Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights.  Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are unpredictable.  If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.\nThe intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products.  Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios.  We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them.  These third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse.  Such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.\nInformation technology dependency and cyber security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, or competitive harm\nThe Company is dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, including cloud-based services (“IT systems”) to conduct its business.  Our IT systems may be vulnerable to disruptions from human error, outdated applications, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions.  We have measures and defenses in place against such events, but we may not be able to prevent, immediately detect, or remediate all instances of such events.  Any significant disruption, breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could cause the loss of data or intellectual property, equipment damage, downtime, and/or safety related issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  A material security breach or disruption of our IT systems could result in theft, unauthorized use, or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information, harm our competitive position, disrupt our manufacturing, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, impair our ability to access vendors, suppliers and cloud-based services, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, we believe that utilities and other operators of critical infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks, including cyber-attack.  In the event of such an attack, disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power (electrical, gas, etc.).\nWe may not earn a positive return from our research, development and engineering investments\nDeveloping our products through our innovation model of research and development is expensive and often involves a long investment cycle.  We make significant expenditures and investments in research, development and engineering that may not earn an economic return.  If our investments do not provide a pipeline of products or technologies that our customers demand or lower our manufacturing costs, it could negatively impact our revenue and operating margins both near- and long-term.\n16\nIf we are unable to obtain certain specialized equipment, raw and batch materials or natural resources required in our products or processes, our business will suffer\nOur ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of equipment, parts, components and raw materials from our suppliers.  We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations.  Certain manufacturing equipment, components and raw materials are available only from single or limited sources, and we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner.  A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, precious metals, raw materials, utilities including energy and industrial water, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nWe use specialized raw materials from single-source suppliers (e.g., specific mines or quarries) and natural resources (e.g., helium) in certain products and processes.  If a supplier is unable to provide the required raw materials or the natural resource is in scarce supply or not readily available, we may be unable to change our product composition or manufacturing process to prevent disruption to our business.\nOur innovation model depends on our ability to attract and retain specialized experts in our core technologies\nOur innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science, ceramic science, and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities.  The loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering team without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nWe are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations\nSome of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste, waste water, other industrial waste or greenhouse gases, and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances.  We have installed anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities.  We have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations.  However, we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards.\nAny failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, or the suspension/cessation of production or operations.  In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in regulations and the regulatory environment in the U.S. and other countries, such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and CO\n2\nabatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may have additional tax liabilities\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions, and are commonly audited by various tax authorities.  There are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain.  Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\n17\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly impacted how U.S. global corporations are taxed.  Significant guidance has been issued with the intention of clarifying the new tax provisions.  To date, some of the regulations had been finalized and clarified but a considerable amount of this guidance is still in the form of proposed regulations.  Due to the volume and complexity of both the final and proposed regulations, we continue to evaluate any development and impact of the 2017 Tax Act that could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.  In addition to the 2017 Tax Act, other foreign countries and international organizations, such as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), may have law changes and issue new international tax standards that may also impact our taxes.\nAs a global company, we face many risks which could adversely impact our operations and financial results\nWe are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenue from, and have significant operations, outside of the United States.  Our international operations include manufacturing, assembly, sales, research and development, customer support, and shared administrative service centers.  Additionally, we rely on a global supply chain for key components and capabilities that are central to our ability to invent, make and sell products.\nCompliance with laws and regulations increases our costs.  We are subject to both U.S. laws and the local laws where we operate which, among other things, include data privacy requirements, employment and labor laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements.  Non-compliance or violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business.  Such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and operating results.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks.\nWe are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization, including those related to:\n\nThe economic and political conditions in each country or region and among countries;\n\nComplex regulatory requirements affecting international trade and investment, including anti-dumping laws, export controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting improper payments.  Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the substance or enforcement of these regulatory requirements, and by actual or alleged violations of them;\n\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates, convertibility of currencies and restrictions involving the movement of funds between jurisdictions and countries;\n\nGovernmental protectionist policies and sovereign and political risks that may adversely affect Corning’s profitability and assets;\n\nTariffs, trade duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping duties;\n\nGeographical concentration of our factories and operations, and regional shifts in our customer base;\n\nPeriodic health epidemic concerns;\n\nPolitical unrest, confiscation or expropriation of assets by foreign governments, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities;\n\nDifficulty in protecting intellectual property, sensitive commercial and operations data, and information technology systems;\n\nDiffering legal systems, including protection and treatment of intellectual property and patents;\n\nComplex, changing or competing tax regimes;\n\nDifficulty in collecting obligations owed to us;\n\nNatural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis and windstorms; and\n\nPotential loss of utilities or other disruption affecting manufacturing.\n18\nWe have significant exposure to foreign currency movements\nA large portion of our sales, profit and cash flows are transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies.  The Company expects to continue to experience fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of these activities if it is not possible, cost-effective or should we not elect to hedge certain currency exposure.  Additionally, gains or losses may be experienced if the underlying exposure which has been hedged increases or decreases significantly.\nThe ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposure that we have, the changes in exchange rates associated with those exposures, whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.\nForeign currency movements may impact our competitive cost position relative to our largest, Japan-based competitors in the Display Technologies segment.  The profitability of customers may also be impacted as they typically purchase from us in Japanese yen and sell in various currencies.\nThese factors, which are variable and generally outside of our control, could materially impact our results of operations, anticipated future results, financial position and cash flows.\nWe may have significant exposure to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio\nWe maintain a significant portfolio of over the counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency and periodically may utilize interest rate derivatives, equity derivatives, and commodities.  We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts.  Any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nCurrent or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations\nAs a global technology and manufacturing company, we are engaged in various litigation and regulatory matters.  Litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, resulting in significant liabilities, penalties or damages.  Any such substantial legal liability or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.\nOur global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Anti-boycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries.  Any alleged or actual violation by an employee or the Company may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States.  We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the way existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials to obtain or retain business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.  Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.  Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of alleged violations.  Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.\n19\nMoreover, several of our key customers are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that may notably differ from those in the United States, and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws, rules and business practices.\nInternational trade policies may negatively impact our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the U.S.\nGovernment policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, tariffs, and capital controls, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us, our equity affiliates or joint ventures, from being able to sell and manufacture products in certain countries.  The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations."

    "text": "Corning is a defendant in various lawsuits and is subject to various claims that arise in the normal course of business, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 14 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements.  In the opinion of management, the likelihood that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on Corning’s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, is remote.\n20\nEnvironmental Litigation\nCorning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the Agency) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites.  Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise.  It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.  At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Corning had accrued approximately $68 million (undiscounted) and $41 million (undiscounted), respectively, for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.  Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote."

Under the Framework, we outlined and demonstrated how Corning’s probability of success increases as we invest in our world-class capabilities. We concentrate approximately 80% of our research, development and engineering investment along with capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five Market-Access Platforms. This strategy allows us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets across the company, as needed, to capture high-return opportunities.\nBuilding on the success of the 2016 - 2019 Framework, we announced our 2020 - 2023 Strategy & Growth Framework, highlighting significant opportunities to sell more Corning content through each of our Market-Access Platforms. Under this new Framework, our leadership priorities and our fundamental approach to capital allocation remain the same. We continue to focus our portfolio and utilize our financial strength. We expect to generate strong operating cash flow as we move forward. We will continue to use our cash to grow, extend our leadership, and reward shareholders.\nWhile 2020, brought unprecedented challenges to our end markets and operations, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, economic uncertainty, and social unrest, Corning adapted rapidly and remained resilient. We executed well to preserve financial strength, while advancing major innovations with industry leaders. We effectively applied our focused and cohesive portfolio to create value and outperform our underlying markets, contributing to growth in the second half of this year.\n‎\n24\n2020 Results\nNet sales in the year ended December 31, 2020 were $11.3 billion, a net decrease of $200 million, or 2%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by lower sales in the Display Technologies, Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments partially offset by higher sales the Specialty Materials segment and “All Other”.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated net income of $512 million, or $0.54 per share, compared to a net income of $960 million, or $1.07 per share, for 2019.  When compared to 2019, the $448 million decrease in net income was primarily due to the following items (amounts presented after tax):\n\nThe negative impact of mark-to-market translated earnings contract losses of $226 million;\n\nHigher costs of $170 million for an asset impairment loss related to investments in research and development programs within “All Other”;\n\nHigher costs for litigation and environmental reserves of $133 million;\n\nHigher expenses\nof $117 million, primarily driven by severance costs for the Display Technologies segment;\n\nThe negative impact of a cumulative adjustment recorded during the first quarter of 2020 to reduce revenue in the amount of $105 million.  The adjustment was associated with a previously recorded commercial benefit asset, reflected as a prepayment, to a customer with a long-term supply agreement that is exiting its production of LCD panels; and\n\nLower segment net income of $73 million mainly driven by lower volumes in the first half of 2020.\nPartially offsetting these events were the following items:\n\nGain on a previously held equity investment in HSG of $387 million;\nand\n\nAn $83 million gain recognized from the initial public offering of an investment in the fourth quarter of 2020\n.\nDiluted earnings per share decreased in 2020 by $0.53 per share, or 50%, when compared to 2019, primarily driven by the decrease\nin net income describ\ned above.  The impact of share repurchases\ndid not materially impact the change in diluted earnings per share.\nThe translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current year, positively impacted Corning’s net income by approximately $51 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019.\n2021 Corporate Outlook\nWe believe 2021 will be a year of growth and\nwe will continue to focus on operational excellence, cash-flow generation and prudent capital allocation.  We expect year-over-year sales growth to accelerate in the first quarter of 2021, with approximately $3.0 - $3.2 billion of net sales.\n25\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSelected highlights from our operations follow (in millions):\n*    Percent change not meaningful.\n‎\n26\nSegment Net Sales\nThe following table presents segment net sales by reportable segment (in millions):\n(1)\nThis amount primarily represents the impact of foreign currency adjustments in the Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments.\n(2)\nAmount represents the negative impact of a cumulative adjustment recorded during the first quarter of 2020 to reduce revenue in the amount of $105 million.  The adjustment was associated with a previously recorded commercial benefit asset, reflected as a prepayment, to a customer with a long-term supply agreement that is exiting its production of LCD panels.\n*    Percent change not meaningful.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, segment net sales decreased by $204 million, or 2%, when compared to the same period in 2019.  The primary sales drivers by segment were as follows:\n\nDisplay Technologies’ net sales decreased by $82 million, primarily driven by lower sales and production volumes in the first half of the year;\n\nOptical Communications’ net sales declined $501 million, as sales declined for carrier products by $273 million and enterprise products by $228 million, due to general market weakness and capital spending reductions by several major customers;\n\nNet sales for Environmental Technologies decreased $129 million, as production facilities of vehicle manufacturers were temporarily shut down during the first half of 2020 in key markets;\n\nNet sales in the Life Sciences segment decreased by $17 million, primarily driven by lab closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\nNet sales increased in the Specialty Materials segment in the amount of $290 million, primarily driven by strong demand for premium cover materials in support of second-half customer launches, growth in IT products due to work and study from home trends, as well as demand for semiconductor equipment products; and\n\nNet sales for “All Other” increased by $235 million, primarily driven by the consolidation of HSG on September 9, 2020, which added sales of $194 million.\nMovements in foreign exchange rates positively impacted Corning’s consolidated net sales by $115 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019.\nIn\n2020 and 2019,\nsales in international markets accounted for 70% and 68%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCost of Sales\nThe types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production-related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter-location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and other production overhead.\n27\nGross Margin\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, gross margin decreased by $504 million, or 12%. Gross margin as a percentage of sales declined by 4 percentage points.  Negative impacts to gross margin were primarily driven by severance charges for the Display Technologies segment and lower volumes in Display Technologies, Optical Communications and Environmental Technologies segments for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nMovements in foreign exchange rates had a $91 million positive impact on Corning’s consolidated gross margin in the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nWhen compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $162 million, or 10%, in the year ended December 31, 2020.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 1% as a percentage of sales.\nThe increase was primarily driven by higher litigation, restructuring and share-based compensation costs, partially offset by salary and cost reductions across the Company.\nThe types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item are: salaries, wages and benefits; stock-based compensation expense; travel; sales commissions; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities and rent for administrative facilities.\nResearch, Development and Engineering Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $123 million, or 12%, when compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by a pre-tax asset impairment loss of $211 million related to the reassessment and reprioritization of research and development programs within “All Other”.\nGiven the current economic environment and market opportunities, Corning has rescoped and significantly reduced its investment in these research and development programs.\nAs a percentage of sales, these expenses were 1% higher when compared to the same period last year.\nRestructuring, Impairment, and Other Charges and Credits\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, and in response to uncertain global economic conditions, Corning undertook actions to transform the Company’s cost structure and improve operational efficiency. During the year ended December 31, 2020, Corning recorded restructuring, impairment, and other charges and credits of $827 million.\nIn the second quarter of 2020, the Company implemented a corporate-wide workforce reduction program.  Severance charges were primarily incurred to facilitate realignment of capacity in the Asia regions for the Display Technologies segment, optimize the Optical Communications segment and contain corporate costs.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, severance charges were $148 million.  As of December 31, 2020, the unpaid severance liabilities of $45 million are expected to be substantially completed within the next twelve months.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Corning incurred a long-lived asset impairment and disposal loss for an asset group related to the reassessment of research and development programs within “All Other”. Given the economic environment and market opportunities, Corning discontinued its investment in these research and development programs. The impairment analysis and disposition of certain assets resulted in a total pre-tax charge of $217 million, primarily recorded in research, development and engineering expenses, as noted above, which was substantially all the carrying value, inclusive of an insignificant amount of goodwill.\nCapacity realignment costs of $304 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily include accelerated depreciation and asset disposals associated with the exit of certain facilities and other exit activities in the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials business segments.  Other charges and credits of $158 million, were related to other exit activities.\nRefer to Note 2 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and Credits) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on restructuring activities and impairment.\n28\nEquity in (Losses) Earnings of Affiliated Companies\nThe following provides a summary of equity in (losses) earnings of affiliated companies (in millions):\n(1)\nThe year ended December 31, 2020, includes HSG’s results of operations through September 8, 2020.  Corning began consolidating HSG on September 9, 2020.\n(2)\nIncludes the Company’s share of a loss related to the sale of a business for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nHSG acquired DuPont’s Trichlorosilane (“TCS”) manufacturing assets, which was determined to be a business and recorded as a business combination. The fair value of the purchase price was $255 million.  In conjunction with this acquisition, HSG settled its pre-existing contract dispute related to a long-term supply agreement with DuPont (“TCS Settlement”) for a contractual amount of $175 million, which was determined to have a fair value of $200 million. See Note 4 (HSG Transactions) to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nHSG’s net income for the period ended September 8, 2020, included a pre-tax gain recorded in the second quarter of 2020, related to the settlement of a long-term supply agreement of approximately $165 million, partially offset by an inventory provision of approximately $44 million associated with the settlement of the agreement.   Prior to the Redemption, in the third quarter of 2020, HSG recorded a pre-tax loss of $200 million resulting from the settlement of a pre-existing contract dispute related to a long-term supply agreement with DuPont (“TCS Settlement”). Corning’s share of the pre-tax loss was $81 million.  Accordingly, Corning’s share of the net impact was an equity loss of $19 million.\nSince September 9, 2020, HSG’s revenue of $194 million has been consolidated in “All Other” in Corning’s consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2020.  The amount of net income is not material to Corning’s consolidated financial statements for the current year.\nAdditional information about corporate investments is presented in Note 3 (Investments) and Note 4 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements.\n29\nTranslated earnings contract (loss) gain, net\nIncluded in the line item translated earnings contract (loss) gain, net, is the impact of foreign currency contracts which hedge our translation exposure arising from movements in the Japanese yen, South Korean won, new Taiwan dollar, euro, Chinese yuan and British pound and its impact on our net income.\nThe following table provides detailed information on the impact of our translated earnings contracts gains and losses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n(1)\nIncludes pre-tax realized losses related to the expiration of option contracts for the year ended 2020, 2019, 2018 of $20 million, $37 million and $11 million, respectively, and was reflected in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n(2)\nThe impact to income was primarily driven by Japanese yen, South Korean won, and euro-denominated hedges of translated earnings.\nIncome Before Income Taxes\nThe translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current year, positively impacted Corning’s income before income taxes by $60 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows (dollars in millions):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the following:\n\nAdditional net provision of $73 million from changes to our tax reserves;\n\nA net provision of $45 million due primarily to stronger foreign earnings relative to U.S. earnings in the current year, as well as U.S. income inclusion under the Internal Revenue Code (“Subpart F income”); and\n\nA net benefit of $116 million due to a net operating loss carryback allowed under the CARES Act.\n‎\n30\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the following:\n\nAdditional net provision of $102 million from changes to our tax reserves;\n\nA net benefit of $45 million due to releases of foreign valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets that are now considered realizable; and\n\nAdditional net benefit, including a change in estimate from prior year, from the 2017 Tax Act attributable to foreign intangible income (FDII) deduction of $103 million offset by taxes for global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of $15 million.\nGenerally, Corning will indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings of: (1) any of its subsidiaries located in jurisdictions where Corning lacks the ability to repatriate its earnings, (2) any of its subsidiaries where Corning’s intention is to reinvest those earnings in operations, (3) legal entities for which Corning holds a non-controlling interest, (4) any subsidiaries with an accumulated deficit in earnings and profits, (5) any subsidiaries which have a positive earnings and profits balance but for which the entity lacks sufficient local statutory earnings or stock basis from which to make a distribution, or (6) any of its subsidiaries where a future distribution would trigger a significant net cost to the U.S. shareholder.\nDuring 2020, the Company distributed approximately $914 million from foreign subsidiaries to their respective U.S. parent companies.  As of December 31, 2020, Corning has approximately $2 billion of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings.  It remains impracticable to calculate the tax cost of repatriating our unremitted earnings which are considered indefinitely reinvested.\nRefer to Note 8 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding income tax matters.\nNet Income Attributable to Corning Incorporated\nAs a result of the items discussed above, net income and per share data was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):\n(1)\nRefer\nto Note 18 (Earnings per Common Share) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information\n.\n31\nComprehensive Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, comprehensive income increased by $144 million, when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the following:\n\nAn increase in the gain on foreign currency translation adjustments in the amount of $671 million, largely driven by the Japanese yen, South Korean won and Chinese yuan.\nThis gain was partially offset by the following:\n\nA decrease in net income of $448 million; and\n\nThe negative impact of a change to net unrealized losses on designated hedges of $54 million.\nRefer to Note 13 (Employee Retirement Plans) and Note 17 (Shareholders’ Equity) to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nCORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nIn managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to report core performance measures.  These items include gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments, restructuring, impairment losses, and other charges and credits, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates.\nCorning utilizes constant-currency reporting for our Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, new Taiwan dollar and the euro.  Effective January 1, 2019, Corning began using constant-currency reporting for our Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments\n.  The Company believes that the use of constant-currency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows.  Corning also believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.\nCore performance measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”).  We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for, GAAP reporting measures.  With respect to the Company’s outlook for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because the Company does not forecast the movement of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the Company’s control.  As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.\n32\nEffective July 1, 2019, we replaced the term “Core Earnings” with “Core Net Income”\n.  The terms are interchangeable and the underlying calculations remain the same.\nFor a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures”.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS – CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES\nSelected highlights from our continuing operations, excluding certain items, follow (in millions):\nCore Net Sales\nCore net sales are consistent with net sales by reportable segment.  The following table presents segment net sales by reportable segment (in millions):\n(1)\nThis amount primarily represents the impact of foreign currency adjustments in the Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments.\n(2)\nAmount represents the negative impact of a cumulative adjustment recorded during the first quarter of 2020 to reduce revenue in the amount of $105 million.  The adjustment was associated with a previously recorded commercial benefit asset, reflected as a prepayment, to a customer with a long-term supply agreement that is exiting its production of LCD panels.\n* Percentage change not meaningful\nSegment net sales and variances are discussed in detail in the Reportable Segments section of our MD&A.\nCore Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies\nThe following provides a summary of core equity in earnings of affiliated companies (in millions):\n(1)\nThe year ended December 31, 2020, includes HSG’s results of operations through September 8, 2020.  Corning began consolidating HSG on September 9, 2020.\n33\nCore Net Income\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated core net income of $1,237 million or $1.39 per share, compared to core net income generated in the year ended December 31, 2019 of $1,578 million, or $1.76 per share.  The decrease in core net income of $341 million was driven by the following items:\n\nLower segment net income of $73 million mainly driven by lower volumes in the first half of 2020; and\n\nLower equity earnings of $151 million.\nCore earnings per share decreased in the year ended December 31, 2020 to $1.39 per share, driven by the decrease in core net income.  The impact of share repurchases did not materially impact the change in diluted earnings per share.\nIncluded in core net income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, is net periodic pension expense in the amount of $50 million, $84 million and $52\nmillion,\nwhich excludes the annual pension mark-to-market adjustments\n.\nRefer to Note 13 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCore Earnings per Common Share\nThe following table sets forth the computation of core basic and core diluted earnings per common share (in millions, except per share amounts):\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nWe utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance.  A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the consolidated statements of income or statement of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the consolidated statements of income or statements of cash flows.\nCore net sales, core equity in earnings of affiliated companies and core net income are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the Company’s operations.\n34\nThe following tables reconcile our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure (amounts in millions except percentages and per share amounts):\n(a)\nBased upon statutory tax rates in the specific jurisdiction for each event.\nSee “Items Excluded from GAAP Measures” below for the descriptions of the footnoted reconciling items.\n‎\n35\n(a)\nBased upon statutory tax rates in the specific jurisdiction for each event.\nSee “Items Excluded from GAAP Measures” below for the descriptions of the footnoted reconciling items.\n‎\n36\nItems which we exclude from GAAP measures to arrive at core performance measures are as follows:\n‎\n37\nREPORTABLE SEGMENTS\nReportable segments are as follows:\n\nDisplay Technologies – manufactures glass substrates for flat panel liquid crystal displays and other high-performance display panels.\n\nOptical Communications – manufactures carrier network and enterprise network components for the telecommunications industry.\n\nSpecialty Materials – manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs.\n\nEnvironmental Technologies – manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel applications.\n\nLife Sciences – manufactures glass and plastic labware, equipment, media, serum and reagents enabling workflow solutions for drug discovery and bioproduction.\nAll other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “All Other.”  This group is primarily comprised of the results of the pharmaceutical technologies, auto glass and new product lines and development projects, as well as other businesses and certain corporate investments.\nThe Company obtained a controlling interest in HSG during the third quarter of 2020 and has consolidated results in “All Other” as of September 9, 2020.  Refer to Note 4 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this transaction.\nFinancial results for the reportable segments are prepared on a basis consistent with the internal disaggregation of financial information to assist the CODM in making internal operating decisions.  The impact of changes in the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and new Taiwan dollar are excluded from segment sales and segment net income for the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.  The impact of changes in the euro and Chinese yuan are excluded from segment sales and segment net income for the Environment Technologies segment.  The impact of changes in the euro, Chinese yuan and Japanese yen are excluded from segment sales and segment net income for the Life Sciences segment.  Certain income and expenses are included in the unallocated amounts in the reconciliation of reportable segment net income (loss) to consolidated net income.  These include items that are not used by the CODM in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to the segments and include the following items:  the impact of the translated earnings contracts; acquisition-related costs; discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments; certain litigation, regulatory and other legal matters; restructuring, impairment losses and other charges and credits; adjustments relating to acquisitions; and other non-recurring non-operational items.  Although these amounts are excluded from segment results, they are included in reported consolidated results.\nEarnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with the reportable segments are included in the respective segment’s net income (loss).  Certain common expenses among reportable segments have been allocated differently than they would for stand-alone financial information.  Segment net income (loss) may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.\nDisplay Technologies\nThe following table provides net sales and net income for the Display Technologies segment:\nNet sales in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower sales and production volumes in the first half of the year.\n38\nNet income in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $69 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven the changes in sales outlined above.\nOptical Communications\nThe following table provides net sales and net income for the Optical Communications segment:\nNet sales declined by $501 million, or 12%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to lower sales in carrier products and enterprise products, down $273 million and $228 million, respectively, driven by general market weakness and capital spending reductions by several major customers.\nNet income in the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $123 million, or 25%\n,\nprimarily driven by the changes in sales, outlined above.  Profitability was impacted by lower sales and production volumes.\nMovements in foreign currency exchange rates did not materially impact net income in this segment in the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019.\nSpecialty Materials\nThe following table provides net sales and net income for the Specialty Materials segment:\nNet sales in the Specialty Materials segment increased by $290 million, or 18%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019.  Results were driven by demand for our premium cover materials, strength in the IT market, and demand for semiconductor related materials.\nNet income in the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $121 million, or 40%, when compared to the same period in 201\n9\n, primarily driven by the sales increases, outlined above, and good cost performance.\nEnvironmental Technologies\nThe following table provides net sales and net income for the Environmental Technologies segment:\nNet sales decreased $129 million, or 9% in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the temporary shutdown of vehicle manufacturing facilities in key markets that began in the first quarter and continued for much of the second quarter.\nNet income in the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $66\nmillion\n, or 25%, driven by the sales decline outlined above.\nProfitability was impacted by lower sales and production volumes.\n39\nLife Sciences\nThe following table provides net sales and net income for the Life Sciences segment:\nNet sales in the Life Sciences segment decreased by $17 million, primarily driven by lab closures during the first half of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNet income decreased by $11 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by\nsales and volume declines.\nAll Other\n“All Other” is a group of segments primarily comprised of the results of pharmaceutical technologies, auto glass, new product lines and development projects, and other businesses or investments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting.\nThe Company obtained a controlling interest in HSG during the third quarter of 2020 and has consolidated results in “All Other” as of September 9, 2020.  Refer to Note 4 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this transaction.\nThe following table provides net sales and net loss for “All Other” (in millions):\nNet sales of this segment increased by $235 million, or 102%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in 2019, driven primarily by consolidation of HSG on September 9, 2020, which added sales of $194 million in the current year.\nThe decrease in the net loss of $75 million is primarily driven by increased sales and lowered spending on development projects\n.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nFinancing and Capital Structure\nThe following items discuss Corning’s financing and changes in capital structure during 2020 and 2019:\n2020\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, Corning redeemed $100 million of 7.0% debentures due in 2024 with a carrying amount of $99 million, paying a $21 million make-whole call premium. The total payment of $121 million is disclosed in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The redemption resulted in a loss of $22 million.\n40\nIn conjunction with the change in control of HSG on September 9, 2020, a variable interest rate loan of $175 million U.S. dollars (“USD”), maturing on September 8, 2021, was made to DC HSC Holdings, LLC, now a consolidated subsidiary of Corning.\nIn December 2020, DC HSC Holdings, LLC repaid $100 million of the loan.  The remaining balance of $75 million is reflected in the current portion of long-term debt and short-term borrowings in Corning’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020.\nRefer to Note 4 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, Corning established an incremental liquidity facility for 25 billion Japanese yen, approximately equivalent to $232 million with a maturity of three years.  As of December 31, 2020, the facility has not been drawn upon.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, Corning established two unsecured variable rate loan facilities for 1,050 million Chinese yuan, equivalent to $150 million, and 749 million Chinese yuan, equivalent to $105 million, each with a maturity of five years.  In the fourth quarter of 2020, Corning established a third unsecured variable rate loan facility for 546 million Chinese yuan, equivalent to $84 million, with a maturity of five years.  Borrowings under these loan facilities for the year ended December 31, 2020, totaled 1,691 million Chinese yuan, or approximately $243 million.  These Chinese yuan-denominated proceeds will not be converted into USD and will be used for capital projects.  Payments of principal and interest on the Notes will be in Chinese yuan, or should yuan be unavailable due to circumstances beyond Corning’s control, a USD equivalent.\nThese loans are the sole obligations of the subsidiary borrowers and are not guaranteed by any other Corning entity.\n2019\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Corning issued two USD-denominated debt securities (the “Notes”), as follows:\n\n$400 million 3.90% senior unsecured notes with a maturity of 30 years; and\n\n$1.1 billion 5.45% senior unsecured notes with a maturity of 60 years.\nThe net proceeds, after deducting offering expenses, were approximately $1.5 billion and will be used for general corporate purposes.  We can redeem these notes at any time, subject to certain terms and conditions.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Corning redeemed $300 million of 4.25% notes due in 2020, paying a premium of $4.7 million by exercising our make-whole call.  The bond redemption resulted in an $8.4 million loss during the same quarter.\nIn the third quarter of 2019, Corning issued two Japanese yen-denominated debt securities (the “Notes”), as follows:\n\n¥31.3 billion 1.153% senior unsecured notes with a maturity of 12 years; and\n\n¥5.9 billion 1.513% senior unsecured notes with a maturity of 20 years.\nThe proceeds from the Notes were received in Japanese yen and converted to USD on the date of issuance.  The net proceeds received in USD, after deducting offering expenses, were approximately $349 million and will be used for general corporate purposes.  Payments of principal and interest on the Notes will be in Japanese yen, or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond Corning’s control, a USD equivalent.\nCommon Stock Dividends\nOn February 3, 2021, Corning’s Board of Directors declared a 9% increase in the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.22 to $0.24 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend paid in the first quarter of 2021.  This increase marks the tenth dividend increase since October 2011.\nOn February 5, 2020, Corning’s Board of Directors declared a 10% increase in the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.20 to $0.22 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend paid in the first quarter of 2020.\n41\nOn February 6, 2019, Corning’s Board of Directors declared an 11% increase in the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.18 to $0.20 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend paid in the first quarter of 2019.\nFixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A\nCorning has 2,300 outstanding shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A.\nThe preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder, and by the Company upon certain events, at a conversion rate of 50,000 shares of Corning’s common stock per one share of preferred stock, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions.  As of December 31, 2020, the preferred stock had not been converted, and none of the anti-dilution provisions had been triggered.  On January 16, 2021, the preferred stock became convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder.\nCustomer Deposits\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Corning had customer deposits of approximately $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion.  The majority of these were non-refundable cash deposits for customers to secure rights to an amount of glass produced by Corning under long-term supply agreements.  The duration of these long-term supply agreements ranges up to 10 years.  As glass is shipped to customers, Corning will recognize revenue and reduce the amount of the customer deposit liability.  The increase in the balance, when compared to the prior period, was primarily driven by a customer deposit liability of $264 million recorded at the fair value of refundable payments that HSG received from a customer under a long-term supply agreement.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, customer deposits used were $140 million and $37 million, respectively.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $1,148 million and $927 million were recorded as other long-term liabilities, respectively.  The remaining $211 million and $104 million, respectively, were classified as other current liabilities.\nDeferred Revenue\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, Corning obtained a controlling interest in HSG and recorded deferred revenue of $1,070 million at fair value related to the performance obligations of non-refundable consideration previously received by HSG from its customers under long term supply agreements.\nThe deferred revenue is tracked on a per-customer contract-unit basis. As customers take delivery of the committed volumes under the terms of the contract, a per unit amount of deferred revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to the customer based upon the units shipped compared to the remaining contractual units.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $872 million was classified as a long-term liability and $152 million remaining was classified as a current liability. These balances reflect reductions in deferred revenue since September 9, 2020.\nCapital Spending\nCapital spending was approximately $1.4 billion in 2020, a decrease of $601 million when compared to 2019.  We expect our 2021 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.4 billion.\n42\nCash Flows\nSummary of cash flow data (in millions):\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $149 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period in the prior year.  The change was primarily driven by\nnet favorable movements in working capital and\nthe refund of tax assessments from the South Korean government, of $730 million and $101 million, respectively, partially offset by increased pension contributions, increased severance payments, lower dividends received from affiliated companies, and higher asbestos claim payments of $219 million, $119 million, $105 million and $80 million, respectively.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $581 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased by $682 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to the same period last year.  The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $1,588 million, partially offset by a reduction in repurchases of treasury stock and debt repayments of $835 million and $79 million, respectively.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees.  Our largest single pension plan is Corning’s U.S. qualified plan.  At December 31, 2020, this plan accounted for 77% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation and 86% of the related plans’ assets.\nIn 2020, Corning made $180 million in voluntary contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and cash contributions of $41 million to our international pension plans.  During 2021, the Company anticipates making cash contributions of $31 million to the international pension plans.\nRefer to Note 13 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nKey Balance Sheet Data\nBalance sheet and working capital measures are provided in the following table (in millions):\n(1)\nIncludes trade payables only.\n43\nManagement Assessment of Liquidity\nWe ended the fourth quarter of 2020 with approximately $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents.  Our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted.  We utilize a variety of strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.  At December 31, 2020, approximately 82% of the consolidated amount was held outside of the United States\n.\nCorning also has a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $1.5 billion.  Under this program, the Company may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.  The Company’s Revolving Credit Agreement is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed.  At December 31, 2020, Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper.\nThe Company’s $1.5 billion Revolving Credit Agreement is available to support its commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company repurchased 4.1 million and 31.0 million shares of common stock, respectively, on the open market for approximately $105 million and $925 million as part of its 2018 Repurchase Program.  The Company suspended share buybacks during the first quarter of 2020 and made no share repurchases for the remainder of the year.\nRefer to Note 17 (Shareholders’ Equity) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nOther\nWe complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk.  We closely monitor payments and developments to identify potential customer credit issues.  From time to time, we factor or sell accounts receivable. Sales of accounts receivable during 2020 were $402 million, which we believe would have been collected during the normal course of business this year. During 2019, Corning participated in customer-initiated payment programs which resulted in accelerated collections of $143 million in accounts receivable.  We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues.\nOur major source of funding for 2021 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt.  We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs.\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant.  The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%.  At December 31, 2020, our leverage using this measure was approximately 37%.  As of December 31, 2020,\nCorning was in compliance and no amounts were outstanding under the Company’s Revolving Credit Agreement.\nOur debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.  In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default exceeding a specified amount on one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument.  As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all such provisions.\nManagement is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity.  In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources.\n44\nTranslated Earnings Contracts\nCorning has hedged a significant portion of its projected yen exposure for the period 2020 through 2024, with average rate forwards and options.  In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded a pre-tax net loss of $38 million and a pre-tax net gain of $201 million, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of these instruments.  Included in these amounts are realized losses of $31 million and $7 million, respectively.  The gross notional value outstanding for these instruments which hedge our exposure to the Japanese yen at December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $6.5 billion and $10.2 billion, respectively.\nWe have entered into average rate forwards to hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the South Korean won and its impact on our net income.  In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded a pre-tax net gain of $24 million and $6 million, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of these instruments.  Included in these amounts is a realized gain of $1 million and a realized loss of $1 million, respectively.  These instruments had a gross notional value outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019, of $0.4 billion.\nWe have entered into a portfolio of average rate forwards to hedge against our euro translation exposure.  In the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded pre-tax loss of $21 million and a pre-tax gain of $37 million, respectively.  Included in these amounts are realized gains of $20 million and realized gain of $29 million, respectively.  At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the euro-denominated average rate instruments had a gross notional amount of $0.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.\nThese derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedges, and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the translated earnings contract (loss) gain, net line of the consolidated statements of income.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which Corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.\nCorning’s off balance sheet arrangements include guarantee and indemnity contracts.  At the time a guarantee is issued, the Company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes.  In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees.  Generally, third-party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones.  These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant.\nRefer to Note 14 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nFor variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.  The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, due to holding variable interests.  Variable interests are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity, that change with changes in the fair value, of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interest entities.\nCorning has identified nine entities that qualify as variable interest entities and are not consolidated.  These entities are not considered to be significant to Corning’s consolidated financial statements.\nCorning does not have retained interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity.\n45\nENVIRONMENT\nRefer to Item 3. Legal Proceedings or Note 14 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements for information.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein.  The estimates that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates, are set forth below.\nValuation of the Previously Held Equity Interest from the Consolidation of HSG\nWe account for the change in controlling interest using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities recorded.  Assets recorded include intangible assets such as developed technologies and know-how, tradenames and customer-related intangibles, fixed assets and inventories.  Liabilities recorded include contract liabilities such as customer deposits and deferred revenue, debt, and other liabilities.  These assets and liabilities recorded are assessed at the time of the change in control and require judgment in ascertaining the fair values. In this business combination, achieved in stages, we also remeasure the previously held equity interest in HSG at the time of the change in control at fair value and recognize the resulting gain in earnings. Independent appraisals assisted the company in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities.  Such appraisals are based on acceptable valuation models as well as inputs and assumptions provided by us. Additional information related to the fair value of the assets and liabilities recorded during the allocation period, not to exceed one year, may result in changes to the recorded values of assets and liabilities, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business combination.  Changes in assumptions and estimates after completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as differences in actual and estimated results could result in impacts to Corning’s financial results.\nIn September 2020, HSG redeemed DuPont’s entire ownership interest in HSG for $250 million. Upon completion of the Redemption, Corning recognized a pre-tax gain of $498 million on its previously held equity investment in HSG as a result of the consolidation resulting from the Redemption. The gain was calculated based on the difference between fair value and carrying value of the equity method investment immediately preceding the Redemption. The fair value of Corning’s equity interest in HSG was estimated by applying the income approach, which was based on significant assumptions such as projected revenue and discount rate.  The company used a discount rate of 16.5% and terminal growth rate of zero.\nUpon completion of the Redemption, we recognized intangible assets consisting primarily of $215 million of developed technologies and know-how, and $70 million of other intangibles that are amortized over the weighted average useful life of approximately 20 and 15 years, respectively.  The developed technologies and know-how intangible assets were valued using two appropriate valuation methods. The developed technologies and know-how intangibles asset valued at $125 million utilized the relief from royalty method, which was based on significant inputs such as projected revenue and key assumptions, including a discount rate of 21.0% and a royalty rate of 7.0%.  The developed technologies and know-how intangibles asset valued at $90 million utilized the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach, which was based on significant inputs such as projected revenue and the key assumption of a discount rate of 19.0%.\nValuation of Deferred Revenue and Customer Deposits from the consolidation of HSG\nUpon completion of the Redemption and resulting consolidation, we recorded a customer deposit liability and deferred revenue.\nCorning recorded a customer deposit of $264 million, at the fair value, of refundable payments that HSG received from a customer under a long-term supply agreement. The discount rates used to calculate the present value of the customer deposit range from 2.54% to 3.23%. The deposits will be repaid from 2029 to 2034 provided that all purchase obligations of this customer under the supply agreement have been satisfied.\n46\nWe recorded deferred revenue of $1,070 million at fair value related to the performance obligations of non-refundable consideration previously received by HSG from its customers under long term supply agreements. The fair values of deferred revenue were estimated by applying a bottoms-up cost buildup method of the cost approach based on significant inputs such as the cost to fulfill the obligations as well as key assumptions including a normal profit margin.\nRefer to Note 3 (Investments) and Note 4 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nImpairment of assets held for use\nWe are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified.  We review long-lived assets in each quarter in which impairment indicators are present.  We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.\nManufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium.  These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life.  Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets.  This review considers all the Company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity.  Precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other non-manufacturing related purposes.\nExamples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include, but are not limited to:\n\nA significant decrease in the market price of an asset;\n\nA significant change in the use of a long-lived or its physical condition;\n\nA significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;\n\nAn accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;\n\nA current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset; and\n\nA current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\nFor purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long-lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  Our assessment is performed at the reportable segment level.  For the majority of our reportable segments, we concluded that locations or businesses within these segments which share production along the supply chain must be combined to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.\nFor long-lived assets, when impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable.  This assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used.  Assessments also consider changes in asset utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production.\n47\nFor an asset group that fails the test of recoverability, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and considers the fair market value of all precious metals, if applicable.  We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value.  Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.  We believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions.  The Company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value of precious metals was $3.4 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, and significantly lower than the fair market value.\nMost of these precious metals are utilized by the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.  Corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments.  The potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments.  Such events include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our Display Technologies or Specialty Materials segments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Corning incurred a long-lived asset impairment and disposal loss for an asset group related to the reassessment and reprioritization of research and development programs within “All Other”. Given the economic environment and market opportunities, Corning discontinued its investment in these research and development programs. The impairment analysis and disposition of certain assets resulted in a total pre-tax charge of $217 million, which was substantially all the carrying value, inclusive of an insignificant amount of goodwill. The fair value of the asset group for the impairment analysis was measured using unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\nRefer to Note 2 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and Credits) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on restructuring activities and impairment.\nIncome taxes\nWe are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets.  Inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies.  These estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business.  It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances.\nCorning accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires that companies only record tax benefits for technical positions that are believed to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  In estimating these amounts, we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor, the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue an opposing position, or alternatively, consider a negotiated compromise, and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities’ assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position.  As a result, it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates.\n48\nFair value measures\nAs required, Corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable.  Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the Company’s own market assumptions.  Once inputs have been characterized, we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels.  Characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement.  In addition, observable market data must be used when available and the highest-and-best-use measure should be applied to non-financial assets.  Corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short-term and long-term investments, certain pension asset investments and derivatives.  These categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions.\nDerivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities.  Included in our forward exchange contracts are foreign currency hedges that hedge our cash flow and translation exposure resulting from movements in the Japanese yen, South Korean won, euro, new Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan and British pound.  Changes in the fair value of contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings.  For contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the translated earnings contract (loss) gain, net line of the consolidated statements of income.  In arriving at the fair value of Corning’s derivative assets and liabilities, we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria, including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction.  Amounts related to credit risk are not material.\nRefer to Note 16 (Fair Value Measurements) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nProbability of litigation outcomes\nCorning is required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain.  In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter, case law, and other case-specific issues.  See Part II – Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of Corning’s material litigation matters.\nOther possible liabilities\nThe Company is required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain.  In making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters, including certain tax planning and environmental matters, these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure.  It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals.\nPension and other postretirement employee benefits (OPEB)\nCorning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents.  The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Company’s assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates), expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates.  The cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover and plan participation.  While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Corning’s employee pension and other postretirement obligations, and current and future expense.\n49\nCosts for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements:  1) on-going costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs; and 2) mark-to-market gains and losses outside of the corridor, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year.  These gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets.  Any interim remeasurement, such as curtailments, settlements, significant plan changes, or adjustments to the annual valuation, is recognized as a mark-to-market adjustment in the quarter in which such an event occurs.\nCosts for OPEB plans consist of on-going costs recognized quarterly, and are comprised of service and interest costs, amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses.  We recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans, to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor.\nThe following table presents our actual and expected return on assets, as well as the corresponding percentages:\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) for U.S. pension plans was $4.2 billion.\nThe following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for U.S. pension plans:\nThe above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time.  Note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.  These changes in assumptions would have no effect on Corning’s funding requirements.\nIn addition, at December 31, 2020, a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would decrease shareholders’ equity by $148 million before tax, and a 25 basis point increase in each spot rate would increase shareholders’ equity by $140 million.  In addition, the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate.\n50\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in each spot rate assumption related to Corning’s U.S. OPEB plans:\n*       Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation (APBO).\nThe above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time.  Note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when all performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied, and control of the product has been transferred to the customer.  If customer acceptance clauses are present and it cannot be objectively determined that control has been transferred, revenue is only recorded when customer acceptance is received and all performance obligations have been satisfied.  Sales of goods typically do not include multiple product and/or service elements.  Corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue over time.  The performance obligations under these contracts generally require services to be performed over time, resulting in either a straight-line amortization method or an input method using incurred and forecasted expense to predict revenue recognition patterns which follows satisfaction of the performance obligation.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nRefer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements.\n‎\n51\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThe statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in reports subsequently filed by Corning with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, and related comments by management that are not historical facts or information and contain words such as “will,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “see,” “would,” and “target” and similar expressions are forward-looking statements.  Such statements relate to future events that by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain.

    "text": "We operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.  Our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects:\n\nExchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings; and\n\nExchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\nOur most significant foreign currency exposure relates to the Japanese yen, South Korean won, new Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan, and the euro.  We seek to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts.  In general, these hedges expire coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions.\nWe are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts.  However, we minimize this risk by maintaining a diverse group of highly-rated major financial institutions as our counterparties.  We do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default.  Neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments.\nOur cash flow hedging activities utilize OTC foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers.  In our net investment hedging activity, we use OTC foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in certain foreign operations against movements in exchange rates.  We also use OTC foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedged instruments.  These contracts are used to offset economic currency risks.  The undesignated hedges limit exposure to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets, monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies.  A significant portion of the Company’s non-U.S. revenue are denominated in Japanese yen.  When this revenue is translated back to U.S. dollars, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements in the Japanese yen.  To protect translated earnings against movements in the Japanese yen, the Company has entered into a series of average rate forwards and other derivative instruments.\nWe use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with foreign currency exposure.  Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates.  At December 31, 2020, with respect to open foreign exchange forward and option contracts, and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements, a 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $1.0 billion compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2019.  Specific to the Japanese yen, a 10% adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $0.8 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The Company expects that these hypothetical losses from a 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates on the derivative financial instruments should largely offset gains on the assets, liabilities and future transactions being hedged."

Corning’s disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Corning in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Corning’s management, including Corning’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or other persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\n(a)\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for Corning.\nCorning’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Corning’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Corning’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that Corning’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Corning’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of Corning’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework\n(2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nManagement excluded HSG from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020,\nas it was previously an equity method investee that is now consolidated by the Company\ndue to a change in control\nduring\n2020\n.  HSG’s internal control over financial reporting is associated with approximately 4% of total assets and 2% of net sales included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nBased on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.  The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report and is included herein.\n54\n(b)\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified by the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the last fiscal year that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting."

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated\nfinancial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in\nManagement's\nAnnual Report on Internal Control\nOver\nFinancial Reporting\n,\nmanagement has excluded Hemlock Semiconductor LLC and Hemlock Semiconductor Operations LLC, (collectively referred to as Hemlock Semiconductor Group) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2020\nbecause\nit was\npreviously an equity method investee that is now consolidated\nby the Company\ndue to a change in control\nduring\n2020.\nWe have also excluded Hemlock Semiconductor Group from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Hemlock Semiconductor Group\nis a substantially owned\nsubsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent\napproximately 4% and 2%,\nrespectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31,\n2020.\n67\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nIncome Taxes - Receivables for South Korean Tax Disputes\nAs described in Notes 1, 8, and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, in evaluating the tax benefits associated with the Company’s various tax filing positions, management records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.\nAdjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company files the return containing the tax position or when new information becomes available.\nThe Company is currently appealing certain South Korean tax assessments and tax refund claims for tax years 2010 through 2018. The Company is required to deposit the disputed tax amounts with the South Korean government as a condition of its appeal of any tax assessments. Management believes that it is more likely than not that these tax positions will prevail in the appeal process and as a result, management recorded a non-current receivable of $365 million as of December 31, 2020.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the receivables for South Korean tax disputes is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when applying the more likely than not recognition criteria to the Company’s uncertain tax positions based on the application of the tax law; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to management’s assumption that the Company will prevail in the appeal of any tax assessments; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to uncertain tax positions, including management’s assessment of the South Korean tax disputes. These procedures also included, among others, obtaining management’s assessment and evidence supporting the more-likely-than-not tax position on the South Korean tax disputes and evaluating the reasonableness of the likelihood that the tax positions will ultimately be sustained upon examination by the South Korean tax authorities and through the appeal process. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating management’s assessment and supporting evidence related to the application of the tax law.\n68\nHemlock Semiconductor Group (HSG) Transactions - Valuation of the Previously Held Equity Interest and Deferred Revenue Resulting from the Consolidation of HSG\nAs described in Notes 1, 3 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, management uses the equity method of accounting for investments in affiliated companies that are not controlled by the Company and in which the Company’s interest is generally between 20% and 50% and the Company has significant influence over the entity.  Hemlock Semiconductor LLC and Hemlock Semiconductor Operations LLC, of which the Company previously held 49.9% and 40.25% ownership interest, respectively, were recorded as equity method investments and are affiliated companies of Hemlock Semiconductor Group (HSG). On September 9, 2020, HSG redeemed DuPont de Nemours, Inc.’s entire ownership interest in HSG with a fair value of $250 million (“Redemption”). Upon completion of the Redemption, the Company obtained a controlling interest of 100% in Hemlock Semiconductor LLC and 80.5% interest in Hemlock Semiconductor Operations LLC and began consolidating HSG. Management recognized a pre-tax gain of $498 million on the Company’s previously held equity investment in HSG as a result of the consolidation resulting from the Redemption. The gain was calculated based on the difference between fair value and carrying value of the equity method investment immediately preceding the Redemption and is\nincluded in the transaction-related gain, net in the Company’s consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2020\n. As disclosed, management estimated the fair value of the Company’s equity interest in HSG by applying the income approach, which was based on significant assumptions such as projected revenues and discount rate. Upon completion of the Redemption and resulting consolidation, management recorded, at fair value, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from HSG, including deferred revenues of $1,070 million related to the performance obligations of non-refundable consideration previously received by HSG from its customers under long term supply agreements. The fair values of deferred revenue were estimated by applying a bottom-up cost buildup method of the cost approach based on significant inputs such as the cost to fulfill the obligations as well as key assumptions including a normal profit margin.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the HSG transactions, specifically the valuation of the previously held equity interest and deferred revenue resulting from the consolidation of HSG, is a critical audit matter are (i) the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures relating to the fair value measurement of the previously held equity interest and deferred revenue resulting from the consolidation of HSG due to the significant judgment by management when developing the estimates; (ii) significant audit effort in evaluating management’s significant assumptions relating to the estimates, such as the projected revenues and discount rate applied when developing the fair value measurement of the previously held equity interest, and a market participant’s cost to fulfill the obligations and the normal profit margin used when developing the fair value measurement of deferred revenue; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the HSG transactions, including controls over the significant assumptions in management’s valuation of the previously held equity interest and deferred revenue from the HSG transactions. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for estimating the fair value of the previously held equity interest and deferred revenue resulting from the consolidation of HSG; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income and cost approaches; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the income and cost approaches; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to projected revenues and the discount rate for the previously held equity interest; and a market participant’s cost to fulfill the obligations and the normal profit margin for deferred revenue. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to\nprojected revenues for the previously held equity interest, a market participant’s cost to fulfill the obligations and the normal profit margin for deferred revenue, involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering current and past performance of HSG. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of management’s income and cost approaches and management’s significant assumptions related to the discount rate and the normal profit margin.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 12, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since\n1944\n.\n69\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n‎\n70\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n‎\n71\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n‎\n72\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n‎\n73\n(1)\nAdjustments to retained earnings include the effect of the accounting changes recorded for the adoption of the new standard for reclassification of stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income in the amount of $\n53\nmillion and the impact of an equity affiliate’s adoption of the new revenue standard in January 2019.  A net reduction of $\n186\nmillion net of tax was recorded to beginning retained earnings for performance obligations of which a significant amount settled by the end of 2019.\n(2)\nRefer to Note 4 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n‎\n74\nCorning Incorporated and Subsidiary Companies\nNotes to Consolidated Fi\nnancial Statements\n1.\nSummary of Signif\nicant Accounting Policies\nOrganization\nCorning Incorporated is a provider of high-performance glass for notebook computers, flat panel desktop monitors, display televisions, and other information display applications; carrier network and enterprise network products for the telecommunications industry; ceramic substrates for gasoline and diesel engines in automotive and heavy duty vehicle markets; laboratory products for the scientific community and specialized polymer products for biotechnology applications; advanced optical materials for the semiconductor industry and the scientific community;\npolycrystalline silicon\nproducts and other technologies.  In these notes, the terms “Corning,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean Corning Incorporated and subsidiary companies.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nCorning’s consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. and include the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries over which Corning exercises control.\nThe equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliated companies that are not controlled by Corning and in which our interest is generally between 20% and 50% and we have significant influence over the entity.  Our share of earnings or losses of affiliated companies, in which at least 20% of the voting securities are owned and we have significant influence but not control over the entity, is included in consolidated operating results.\nFor our investments in companies that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, we use the fair value method to account for the investments if readily determinable fair values are available.  For the investments without readily determinable fair values, we measure them at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment.\nOn September 9, 2020,\nupon completion of the Redemption, the Company obtained a\n100\n% interest in Hemlock Semiconductor LLC and\n80.5\n% interest in Hemlock Semiconductor Operations LLC and began consolidating HSG\n, which are affiliated entities within the Hemlock Semiconductor Group (“HSG”).\nRefer to Note 3 (Investments) and Note 4 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nAll material intercompany accounts, transactions and profits are eliminated in consolidation.\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.  These reclassifications had no impact on the results of operations, financial position, or changes in shareholders’ equity.\n75\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements, in conformity with GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities\nin the consolidated financial statements and related notes.  Significant estimates and assumptions in these consolidated financial statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition, restructuring charges, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment tests, estimates of acquired assets and liabilities, estimates of fair value of investments, equity interests, environmental and legal liabilities, income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement employee benefit expenses and the fair value of share-based compensation.  Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these estimates.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting adverse impacts to global economic conditions, as well as to Corning’s operations, may impact future estimates including, but not limited to, inventory valuations, fair value measurements, goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, the effectiveness of the Company’s hedging instruments, deferred tax valuation allowances, actuarial losses on retirement benefit plans and discount rate assumptions.\nRevenue Recognition\nMost of the Company’s revenue is generated by delivery of products to customers and recognized at a point in time based on evaluation of when the customer obtains control of the products.  Revenue is recognized when all performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, and control of the product has been transferred to the customer.  If customer acceptance clauses are present and it cannot be objectively determined that control has been transferred, revenue is only recorded when customer acceptance is received and all performance obligations have been satisfied.  Sales of goods typically do not include multiple product and/or service elements.\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.  Sales tax, value-added tax, and other taxes are collected concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.  Incidental contract costs that are not material in the context of the delivery of goods and services are recognized as expense.\nAt the time revenue is recognized, allowances are recorded, with the related reduction to revenue, for estimated product returns, allowances and price discounts based upon historical experience and related terms of customer arrangements.  Where product warranties are offered, liabilities are established for estimated warranty costs based upon historical experience and specific warranty provisions.  Warranty liabilities are adjusted when experience indicates the expected outcome will differ from initial estimates of the liability.\nIn addition, Corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which revenue is recognized over time.  The performance obligations under these contracts generally require services to be performed over time, resulting in either a straight-line amortization method or an input method using incurred and forecasted expense to predict revenue recognition patterns which follows satisfaction of the performance obligation.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.  Research and development costs totaled $\n1.0\nbillion, $\n833\nmillion and $\n807\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n76\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\nThe determination of the functional currency for Corning’s foreign subsidiaries is made based on the appropriate economic factors.  For most foreign operations, the local currencies are generally considered to be the functional currencies.  Corning’s most significant exception is a Taiwanese subsidiary, which uses the Japanese yen as its functional currency.  For all transactions denominated in a currency other than a subsidiary’s functional currency, exchange rate gains and losses are included in income for the period in which the exchange rates changed.  Net losses of $\n37\nmillion, $\n19\nmillion and $\n43\nmillion were recorded for foreign currency transaction activity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Foreign subsidiary functional currency balance sheet accounts are translated at current exchange rates, and statement of operations accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the year.  Translation gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity.  The effects of remeasuring non-functional currency assets and liabilities into the functional currency are included in current earnings, except for those related to intra-entity foreign currency transactions of a long-term investment nature, which are recorded together with translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity.  Upon sale or substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign entity, the amount of net translation gains or losses that have been accumulated in other comprehensive income attributable to that investment are reported as a gain or loss for the period in which the sale or liquidation occurs.\nShare-Based Compensation\nCorning’s share-based compensation programs include employee stock option grants, time-based restricted stock awards and time-based restricted stock units, as more fully described in Note 19 (Share-Based Compensation) to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe cost of share-based compensation awards is equal to the fair value of the award at the date of grant and compensation expense is recognized for those awards earned over the vesting period. Corning estimates the fair value of share-based awards using a multiple-point Black-Scholes option valuation model, which incorporates assumptions including expected volatility, dividend yield, risk-free rate, expected term and departure rates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash.  Securities with contractual maturities of three months or less, when purchased, are considered cash equivalents.  The carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.\nSupplemental disclosure of cash flow information is as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nIncluded in this amount are approximately $\n58\nmillion, $\n54\nmillion and $\n49\nmillion of interest costs that were capitalized as part of property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the best estimate of the amount of probable lifetime credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The Company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience and expected future default rate by industry. In addition, in circumstances where the Company is made aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific allowance is established.  The Company does not have any significant off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.\n77\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nThe Company accrues for its environmental investigation, remediation, operating and maintenance costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  For environmental matters, the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site, current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience.  For sites with multiple potentially responsible parties, the Company considers its likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill obligations in establishing a provision for those costs.  Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another, the minimum undiscounted amount is accrued.  When future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage, an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded related to the insurance reimbursement when reimbursement is virtually certain.\nThe uncertain nature inherent in such remediation and the possibility that initial estimates may not reflect the outcome could result in additional costs being recognized by the Company in future periods.\nInventories, net\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (“NRV”), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net of Accumulated Depreciation\nLand, buildings, and equipment, including precious metals, are recorded at cost.  Depreciation is based on estimated useful lives of properties using the straight-line method.  Except as described in Note 9 (Property, Plant and Equipment, Net of Accumulated Depreciation) to the consolidated financial statements related to the depletion of precious metals, the estimated useful lives range from\n10\nto\n40 year\ns for buildings and\n2\nto\n20 year\ns for equipment.\nIncluded in the subcategory of equipment are the following types of assets (excluding precious metals):\nManufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals.  These assets are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in the Company’s manufacturing processes over a very long useful life.  The physical loss of precious metals in the manufacturing and reclamation process is treated as depletion and these losses are accounted for as a period expense based on actual units lost.  Precious metals are integral to many glass production processes and are only acquired to support operations.  These metals are not held for trading or other purposes.\nLeases\nCorning leases certain real estate, vehicles, and equipment from third parties.  Corning classifies leases as either financing or operating.\nOperating leases are included in other assets, with the corresponding liability in other accrued liabilities and other liabilities, on the consolidated balance sheets.  Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, with the corresponding liability in the current portion and long-term debt line items on the consolidated balance sheets.  As a practical expedient, lease and non-lease components of a contract are accounted for as a single lease component across all underlying asset classes.\nCorning does not have any significant agreements as a lessor.\n‎\n78\nLease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term for operating leases.  Financing leases are recognized on the effective interest method for interest expense and straight-line method for asset amortization.  Renewals and terminations are included in the calculation of the Right of Use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities when considered to be reasonably certain to be exercised.  When the implicit rate is unknown, the incremental borrowing rate, based on commencement date, is used in determining the present value of lease payments.\nCorning’s leases do not include residual value guarantees.  The Company is not the primary beneficiary in and does not have other forms of variable interests with the lessor of the leased assets.\nRefer to Note 7 (Leases) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe recoverability of long-lived assets, such as plant and equipment and intangible assets, is reviewed when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable.  When impairment indicators are present, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, is compared to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable.  For an asset group that fails the test of recoverability, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and considers the fair market value of all precious metals.  The recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets was assessed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value.\nWe are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified.  We review long-lived assets in each quarter in which impairment indicators are present.  We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Corning incurred a long-lived asset impairment and disposal loss for an asset group related to the reassessment of research and development programs within “All Other”. Given the economic environment and market opportunities, Corning discontinued its investment in these research and development programs. The impairment analysis and disposition of certain assets resulted in a total pre-tax charge of $\n217\nmillion, which was substantially all the carrying value, inclusive of an insignificant amount of goodwill. The fair value of the asset group for the impairment analysis was measured using unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\nEmployee Retirement Plans\nCorning offers employee retirement\nplans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents.  The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Company’s assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates), expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates.  The cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover and plan participation.\nCosts for defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements:  1) on-going costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs; and 2) mark-to-market gains and losses outside of the corridor, where the corridor is equal to\n10\n% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year.  These gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets.  Any interim remeasurement, triggered by a curtailment, settlement or significant plan change, as well as any true-up to the annual valuation, is recognized as a mark-to-market adjustment in the quarter in which such event occurs.\n79\nCosts for postretirement benefit plans consist of on-going costs recognized quarterly, and are comprised of service and interest costs, amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses.  Actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity on an annual basis and amortized into operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans, to the extent such gains and losses are outside the corridor.\nRefer to Note 13 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and for differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.\nThe effective income tax rate reflects the assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits.  In evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.  Adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we file the return containing the tax position or when new information becomes available. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is included in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.\nDiscrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.  Valuation allowances are established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will ultimately be realized.\nGenerally, Corning will indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings of: (1) any of its subsidiaries located in jurisdictions where Corning lacks the ability to repatriate its earnings, (2) any of its subsidiaries where Corning’s intention is to reinvest those earnings in operations, (3) legal entities for which Corning holds a non-controlling interest, (4) any subsidiaries with an accumulated deficit in earnings and profits, (5) any subsidiaries which have a positive earnings and profits balance but for which the entity lacks sufficient local statutory earnings or stock basis from which to make a distribution, and (6) any of its subsidiaries where future distribution would trigger a significant net cost to the U.S. shareholder.\nEquity Method Investments\nEquity method investments are reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis, or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.  This assessment is based on a review of the equity investments’ performance and a review of indicators of impairment to determine if there is evidence of a loss in value.\nFor an equity investment with impairment indicators, the fair value is measured based on discounted cash flows, or other appropriate valuation methods, depending on the nature of the company involved.  If it is probable that the carrying amount of the investment cannot be recovered, the impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recorded in earnings, and the equity investment balance is reduced to its fair value.\nAll equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. The Company utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions. The balance of these investments is disclosed in Note 3 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements.\n80\nFair Value Measurements\nMajor categories of financial assets and liabilities, including short-term investments, other assets and derivatives are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when impaired, which include long-lived assets, goodwill, asset retirement obligations, equity method investments and other investments that Corning cannot significantly influence.\nFair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact is analyzed.  Assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of non-performance, are considered.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company enters into a variety of foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.  Interest rate swaps are utilized to reduce the risk of changes in a benchmark interest rate from the probable forecasted issuance of debt and manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt.  Financial exposure is managed in accordance with corporate policies and procedures.\nAll derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations are not recognized in current operating results but are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.  Amounts related to cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings.  This reclassification is recorded in the same line item of the consolidated statements of income as where the effects of the hedged item are recorded, typically sales, cost of sales or other expense, net.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in the consolidated statements of income in the translated earnings contract (loss) gain, net and the other expense, net lines.\nNew Accounting Standards\nOn January 1, 2020, Corning adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13 ASC (Topic 326), Financial Instruments - Credit Losses.  The ASU introduces a new accounting model, the Current Expected Credit Losses model (CECL), which requires earlier recognition of credit losses and additional disclosures related to credit risk.  The CECL model utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired.  The CECL model was adopted to recognize credit losses of financial assets using a modified retrospective method of accounting as of January 1, 2020.  The impact of adopting the new standard to the financial statements was a nominal reduction to beginning retained earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there are no other newly issued accounting standards expected to have a material impact on Corning’s financial statements or disclosures.\n2.\nRestructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and Credits\nIn 2020, and in response to uncertain global economic conditions, Corning undertook actions to transform the Company’s cost structure and improve operational efficiency. These actions included a corporate-wide workforce reduction program, disposals of certain assets and accelerated depreciation associated with the capacity realignment of certain manufacturing facilities as well as other exit charges and credits.\n81\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the following restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits were recorded (in millions):\nSeverance\nIn the second quarter of 2020, the Company implemented a corporate-wide workforce reduction program.  Severance charges were primarily incurred to facilitate realignment of capacity in the Asia regions for the Display Technologies segment, optimize the Optical Communications segment and contain corporate costs.  For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, severance charges were $\n148\nmillion, $\n63\nmillion and $\n16\nmillion, respectively.  As of December 31, 2020, the unpaid severance liabilities of $\n45\nmillion are expected to be substantially completed within the next twelve months.\nAsset Impairment\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Corning incurred a long-lived asset impairment and disposal loss for an asset group related to the reassessment of research and development programs within “All Other”. Given the economic environment and market opportunities, Corning discontinued its investment in these research and development programs. The impairment analysis and disposition of certain assets resulted in a total pre-tax charge of $\n217\nmillion, which was substantially all the carrying value, inclusive of an insignificant amount of goodwill.\nCapacity Realignment\nCapacity realignment for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily includes accelerated depreciation and asset disposals associated with the exit of certain facilities and other exit activities in the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials business segments.  Capacity realignment for the year ended December 31, 2019, is primarily comprised of accelerated depreciation associated with the exit of certain facilities in the Display Technologies segment.  Capacity realignment for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily includes accelerated depreciation and asset disposals in the Specialty Materials business and “All Other”.\n‎\n82\nThe following tables present the impact and respective location of total restructuring, impairment, and other charges and credits on the consolidated statements of income (in millions):\n(1)\nActivity reflected in cost o\nf sales.\n83\n3.\nInvestments\nInvestments are comprised of the following (in millions):\n(1)\nAmounts reflect Corning’s direct ownership interest in the affiliated companies at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(3)\nIncluded in other investments were equity securities with readily available fair values that were measured using Level 1 inputs, in the amount of $\n137\nmillion as of December 31, 2020.  The increase in the investment balance is primarily driven by a recognized gain of $\n107\nmillion from the initial public offering of an investment in the fourth quarter of 2020.  Refer to Note 16 (Fair Value Measurements) for additional information.\n(3)\nCorning began consolidating HSG on September 9, 2020.  At December 31, 2019, the negative carrying value of Corning’s investment in HSG was $\n270\nmillion and recorded in other liabilities.\nAffiliated Companies at Equity Method\nThe results of operations and financial position of the investments accounted for under the equity method is presented below as of December 31 for each respective year (in millions):\n(1)\nThe year ended December 31, 2020, only include HSG’s results of operations through September 8, 2020.  Immediately following the Redemption, Corning began consolidating HSG on September 9, 2020.\n84\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the undistributed earnings of equity companies included in retained earnings were not material.\nHemlock Semiconductor Group (“HSG”)\nIn 2016, Corning realigned its ownership interest in Dow Corning, exchanging its\n50\n% interest in the joint venture between Corning and Dow Chemical for a newly formed company that held a\n49.9\n% interest in Hemlock Semiconductor LLC and a\n40.25\n% interest in Hemlock Semiconductor Operations LLC which were recorded as equity method investments of Corning and are affiliated companies of HSG. DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (“DuPont”) subsequently undertook Dow Chemical Company’s ownership interest in HSG. HSG manufactures polysilicon products for the semiconductor and solar industries, and it is one of the world’s leading providers of ultra-pure polycrystalline silicon to the semiconductor industry.\n2020\nOn September 9, 2020, HSG entered into a series of agreements with DuPont resulting in a change in control and consolidation for Corning.\nHSG acquired DuPont’s TCS manufacturing assets, which was determined to be a business and recorded as a business combination. The fair value of the purchase price was $\n255\nmillion.  In conjunction with this acquisition, HSG settled the TCS Settlement for a contractual amount of $\n175\nmillion, which was determined to have a fair value of $\n200\nmillion.  Corning’s share of the pre-tax loss was $\n81\nmillion and recorded in equity in (losses) earnings of affiliated companies in the consolidated statements of income.  See Note 4 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nHemlock Semiconductor LLC and Hemlock Semiconductor Operations LLC, of which Corning previously held\n49.9\n% and\n40.25\n% ownership interest, respectively, were recorded as equity method investments and are affiliates of Hemlock Semiconductor Group (HSG).  On September 9, 2020, HSG redeemed DuPont’s entire ownership interest in HSG with a fair value of $\n250\nmillion (“Redemption”).  Upon completion of the Redemption, Corning obtained a controlling interest of\n100\n% in Hemlock Semiconductor LLC and\n80.5\n% in Hemlock Semiconductor Operations LLC and began consolidating HSG.\nSince September 9, 2020, HSG’s revenue of $\n194\nmillion has been consolidated in “All Other” in Corning’s consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2020.  The amount of net income is not material to Corning’s consolidated financial statements for the current year.\nSee Note 4 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\n2019\nIn prior years, HSG’s solar and semiconductor customers entered into long-term “take or pay” contracts which included up-front cash payments to secure capacity.  During the last few years, and more significantly in 2019, the solar power panel industry experienced significant over-capacity in the market, resulting in declining sales volumes and market prices.  As a result, HSG’s solar business experienced lower market penetration, overall price declines, and settled contracts with customers that had committed volume and fixed pricing above the current market price.  While these settlements positively impacted HSG’s cash flow in 2019, they reduced expectations for future sales in HSG’s solar business.\nDue to the adverse change in HSG’s solar business, HSG was required to assess the recoverability of its long-lived assets in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Based on this assessment, HSG determined that the carrying values of HSG’s solar asset group significantly exceeded its fair values.  HSG engaged a third-party appraiser to assist in determining the fair value of the assets within in the solar asset group based on the highest and best use of the asset group.  As a result of the fair value determination, HSG recognized a pre-tax asset impairment charge of $\n916\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Corning’s share of the pre-tax impairment was $\n369\nmillion.\n‎\n85\nDue to the adverse changes above, the carrying values of HSG’s solar business inventories were also affected resulting in an inventory write-down of $\n257\nmillion for the year.  Corning’s pre-tax share of the provision was $\n105\nmillion.\nIn addition, HSG settled certain revenue contracts in the fourth quarter of 2019, resulting in settlement gains of $\n383\nmillion in net income.  Corning’s share of the settlement gains was $\n185\nmillion.\nHSG’s results of operations and balance sheet through September 8, 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nThe year ended December 31, 2020, only include HSG’s results of operations through September 8, 2020.  Immediately following the Redemption, Corning began consolidating HSG on September 9, 2020.\n(2)\nHSG’s net income for the period ended September 8, 2020, included a pre-tax gain recorded in the second quarter of 2020, related to the settlement of a long-term supply agreement of approximately $\n165\nmillion, partially offset by an inventory provision of approximately $\n44\nmillion associated with the settlement of the agreement.   Prior to the Redemption, in the third quarter of 2020, HSG recorded a pre-tax loss of $\n200\nmillion resulting from the TCS Settlement, of which Corning’s share of the pre-tax loss was $\n81\nmillion.  Accordingly, Corning’s share of the net impact was an equity loss of $\n19\nmillion.\n(3)\nHSG’s balance sheet were presented as of September 8, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n4.\nH\nSG Transactions and Acquisitions\nHSG Transactions\nOn September 9, 2020, HSG acquired DuPont’s TCS manufacturing assets, which was determined to be a business and recorded as a business combination. The fair value of the purchase price was $\n255\nmillion.  In conjunction with this acquisition, HSG resolved the TCS Settlement for a contractual amount of $\n175\nmillion, which was determined to have a fair value of $\n200\nmillion.\nHSG will pay for the TCS Settlement over\nthree years\nwith equal annual payments of approximately $\n58\nmillion.\n‎\n86\nThe Redemption was funded with HSG’s existing cash on-hand of $\n75\nmillion and its newly obtained third-party debt of $\n175\nmillion, maturing on September 8, 2021.  The third-party debt was recorded as a non-cash financing activity on Corning’s consolidated statements of cash flows.  In December 2020, HSG repaid $\n100\nmillion on the third-party debt. Refer to Note 3 (Investments) and Note 12 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nHemlock Semiconductor LLC and Hemlock Semiconductor Operations LLC, of which Corning previously held\n49.9\n% and\n40.25\n% ownership interest, respectively, were recorded as equity method investments and are affiliates of Hemlock Semiconductor Group (HSG).  As of September 9, 2020, HSG redeemed Dupont’s entire ownership of HSG with a value of $\n250\nmillion (Redemption), Upon completion of the redemption, Corning obtained a\n100\n% interest in HS LLC and\n80.5\n% interest in HSO LLC.  Corning accounted for the Redemption under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with business combinations without the transfer of net cash consideration.  The Redemption price of $\n250\nmillion approximated the fair value of Corning’s equity interest in HSG immediately preceding the Redemption.\nThe fair value of Corning’s equity interest in HSG was estimated by applying the income approach, which was based on significant assumptions such as projected revenue and discount rate.  The Company used a discount rate of\n16.5\n% and terminal growth rate of\nzero\n.  As no net-cash consideration was transferred, the fair value of Corning’s previously held equity interest in HSG was used to measure the goodwill resulting from the Redemption and the Company’s controlling interest after the Redemption.\nCorning recognized a pre-tax gain of $\n498\nmillion on its previously held equity investment in HSG as a result of the consolidation resulting from the Redemption. The gain was calculated based on the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the equity method investment immediately preceding the Redemption and included in the transaction-related gain, net in Corning’s consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe net gain on previously owned equity was calculated as follows (in millions):\nThe following table summarizes the amounts of recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of September 9, 2020, which include the TCS assets and liabilities acquired by HSG immediately prior to the Redemption and the consolidation by Corning.\nRecognized amounts of identified assets and liabilities recorded at fair value (in millions):\n(1)\nThe other current and non-current assets included a contingent consideration asset of $\n20\nmillion at fair value for a cost adjustment contract related to the TCS Transaction.  Refer to Note 3 (Investments) and Note 16 (Fair Value Measurements) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n(2)\nThe purchase price used to measure the goodwill of the Redemption is $\n352\nmillion, including the fair value of Corning’s previously held equity interest and non-controlling interest, in the amount of $\n250\nmillion and $\n102\nmillion, respectively.\n(3)\nThe goodwill recognized is not deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.  The goodwill was allocated to “All Other” within segment reporting as disclosed in Note 20 (Reportable Segments) to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\n87\nUpon completion of the Redemption and resulting consolidation, Corning recorded preliminary values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from HSG, including a customer deposit liability and deferred revenue.\nCorning recorded a customer deposit liability of $\n264\nmillion at the fair value of refundable payments that HSG received from a customer under a long-term supply agreement. The discount rates used to calculate the present value of the customer deposit range from\n2.54\n% to\n3.23\n%. The deposits will be repaid from 2029 to 2034 provided that all purchase obligations of this customer under the supply agreement have been satisfied.\nCorning also recorded deferred revenue of $\n1,070\nmillion at fair value related to the performance obligations of non-refundable consideration previously received by HSG from its customers under long term supply agreements. The fair values of deferred revenue were estimated by applying a bottoms-up cost buildup method of the cost approach based on significant inputs such as the cost to fulfill the obligations as well as key inputs including a normal profit margin.\nThe goodwill is primarily related to other intangibles and synergies of the acquired business which do not qualify for separate recognition.  Intangible assets consist primarily of $\n215\nmillion of developed technologies and know-how, and $\n70\nmillion of other intangibles that are amortized over the weighted average useful life of approximately\n20\nand\n15\nyears, respectively.  Acquisition-related costs of $\n12\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020, included costs for legal and other professional services and were included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe fair value of the non-controlling interest in HSG was estimated to be $\n102\nmillion by applying the income approach, using the same key assumptions as the estimate of fair value for Corning’s equity interest in HSG.\nSince September 9, 2020, HSG’s revenue of $\n194\nmillion has been consolidated in “All Other” in Corning’s consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2020.  The amount of net income is not material to Corning’s consolidated financial statements for the current year.\nAcquisitions\nThere were no material acquisitions completed in 2020 or 2019.\nDuring 2018, Corning acquired\nsubstantially all of 3M Company’s (3M) Communication Markets Division\nin two cash transactions totaling $\n841\nmillion.  Corning acquired a manufacturing facility and a business, which designs, manufactures and markets high bandwidth and optical fiber products.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination.\nA summary of the allocation of the total purchase price to the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired, with the remainder recorded as goodwill based on fair value is as follows\n(in millions):\n(1)\nAmounts reflect measurement period adjustments.\n(2)\nThe goodwill recognized is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.  The goodwill was allocated to the Optical Communications segment.\n88\nGoodwill is related to the value of CMD’s product and customer portfolio and its combination with Corning’s existing optical communications platform, as well as synergies and other intangibles that do not qualify for separate recognition.  Other intangible assets consist primarily of $\n434\nmillion of customer relationships and $\n91\nmillion of other intangibles that are amortized over the weighted average useful life of approximately\n14\nand\n11\nyears, respectively.  Acquisition-related costs of $\n18\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2018, included costs for legal, accounting, valuation and other professional services and were included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income.  Supplemental pro forma information was not provided because the acquisition was not material to Corning’s consolidated financial statements.\n5.\nRevenue\nProduct Revenue (Point in Time)\nMost of the Company’s revenue is generated by delivery of products to customers and recognized at a point in time based on evaluation of when the customer obtains control of the products.  Revenue is recognized when all performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied, and control of the product has been transferred to the customer.  If customer acceptance clauses are present and it cannot be objectively determined that control has been transferred, revenue is only recorded when customer acceptance is received and all performance obligations have been satisfied.  Sales of goods typically do not include multiple product and/or service elements.\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.  Sales tax, value-added tax, and other taxes are collected concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.  Incidental contract costs that are not material in the context of the delivery of goods and services are recognized as expense.\nAt the time revenue is recognized, allowances are recorded, with the related reduction to revenue, for estimated product returns, allowances and price discounts based upon historical experience and related terms of customer arrangements.  Where product warranties are offered, liabilities are established for estimated warranty costs based upon historical experience and specific warranty provisions.  Warranty liabilities are adjusted when experience indicates the expected outcome will differ from initial estimates of the liability.  Product warranty liabilities were not material at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nOther Revenue (Over Time)\nCorning’s revenue over time is mainly related to Telecommunications products, and comprised of design, installation, training and software maintenance services.\nThe performance obligations under these contracts generally require services to be performed over time, resulting in either a straight-line amortization method or an input method using incurred and forecasted expense to predict revenue recognition patterns which follows satisfaction of the performance obligations.  Corning’s other revenue is inconsequential to consolidated results.\nRevenue Disaggregation Table\nThe following table shows revenue by major product categories, similar to the reportable segment disclosure.  Within each product category, contract terms, conditions and economic factors affecting the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty around revenue recognition and cash flows are substantially similar.  The commercial markets and selling channels are also similar.  Except for an inconsequential number of Telecommunications products, product category revenue is recognized at point in time when control transfers to the customer.\n89\nRevenue by product category is as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nThis amount primarily represents the impact of foreign currency adjustments in the Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments.\nAt the end of 2015, Corning entered into an agreement with a customer pursuant to which Corning exchanged contingent consideration, for the incremental fair value associated with several commercial agreements, including the amendment of the customer’s long-term supply agreement.  The net present fair value of the commercial benefit asset related to the long-term supply agreement of $\n212\nmillion was reclassified to the other asset line of the consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the term of agreement as a reduction in revenue.  During March 2020, this customer announced its decision to exit its production of LCD panels by the end of 2020.  Based on this announcement, Corning recorded a cumulative adjustment of $\n105\nmillion during the first quarter of 2020 and recognized the remaining balance as a reduction to revenue over the remainder of the current year.  Due to the one-time nature of this cumulative adjustment, it has been excluded from segment results.  However, it is included in the reconciliation from segment net income (loss) to consolidated net income.\nRefer to Note 20 (Reportable Segments) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nContract assets, such as incremental costs to obtain or fulfill contracts, are an insignificant component of Corning’s revenue recognition process.  Most of Corning’s cost of fulfillment as a manufacturer of products is classified as inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets, which are accounted for under the respective guidance for those asset types.  Other costs of contract fulfillment are immaterial due to the nature of the products and their respective manufacturing processes.\nContract liabilities include deferred revenue, other advanced payments and customer deposits.  Other advanced payments are not significant to operations and are classified as part of other accrued liabilities in the financial statements.  Customer deposits are predominately related to Display products and deferred revenue is predominately related to obtaining a controlling interest in HSG.  Both are classified as part of other accrued liabilities and other liabilities, as appropriate, and are disclosed below.  Refer to Note 4 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n90\nCustomer Deposits\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Corning had customer deposits of approximately $\n1.4\nbillion and $\n1.0\nbillion.  The majority of these were non-refundable cash deposits for customers to secure rights to an amount of glass produced by Corning under long-term supply agreements.  The duration of these long-term supply agreements ranges up to\n10 year\ns.  As glass is shipped to customers, Corning will recognize revenue and reduce the amount of the customer deposit liability.  The increase in the balance, when compared to the prior period, was primarily driven by a customer deposit liability of $\n264\nmillion recorded at the fair value of refundable payments that HSG received from a customer under a long-term supply agreement.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, customer deposits used were $\n140\nmillion and $\n37\nmillion, respectively.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $\n1,148\nmillion and $\n927\nmillion were recorded as other long-term liabilities, respectively.  The remaining $\n211\nmillion and $\n104\nmillion, respectively, were classified as other current liabilities.\nDeferred Revenue\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, Corning obtained a controlling interest in HSG and recorded deferred revenue of $\n1,070\nmillion at fair value related to the performance obligations of non-refundable consideration previously received by HSG from its customers under long term supply agreements.\nThe deferred revenue is tracked on a per-customer contract-unit basis. As customers take delivery of the committed volumes under the terms of the contract, a per unit amount of deferred revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to the customer based upon the units shipped compared to the remaining contractual units.\nAs of December 31, 2020, $\n872\nmillion was classified as a long-term liability and $\n152\nmillion remaining was classified as a current liability. These balances reflect reductions in deferred revenue since September 9, 2020.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nThe value of unsatisfied performance obligations is not disclosed for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which revenue has been recognized at an amount for which the right exists to invoice for services performed.\nShipping and handling fees are treated as fulfillment costs and not as separate performance obligations under the terms of revenue contracts due to the perfunctory nature of the shipping and handling obligations.\nSignificant Customers\nFor 2020, 2019 and 2018, no customer met or exceeded 10% of Corning’s consolidated net sales.\n6.\nInventories, Net\nInventories, net, are comprised of the following (in millions)\n(1)\n:\n(1)\nCorning obtained a controlling interest in HSG as of September 9, 2020.  Consolidated inventories as of December 31, 2020, included $\n461\nmillion of inventories from HSG.  Refer to Note 4 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n91\n7.\nLeases\nCorning has operating and finance leases for real estate, vehicles, and equipment.\nThe following table shows components of lease expense (in millions):\nTotal rental expense for operating leases of $\n156\nmillion was recorded in the year ended 2018 and accounted for under the previous leasing standard.\nThe following table shows components of cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities (in millions):\n92\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows (in millions, except lease term and discount rate):\n(1)\nIncluded in other assets.\n(2)\nIncluded in other liabilities.\nThe weighted average remaining lease terms for operating and financing leases are\n12.5\nyears and\n15.5\nyears, respectively.  The weighted average discount rates for operating and financing leases are\n3.9\n% and\n4.7\n%, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, maturities of lease liabilities are as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2020, Corning had additional operating leases, primarily for new production facilities, that have not yet commenced or been recorded, of approximately $\n138\nmillion on an undiscounted basis.  These operating leases will commence in fiscal year 2021 with lease terms of\n20 year\ns\n.\n8.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome before income taxes follows (in millions):\n93\nThe current and deferred amounts of the provision for income taxes are as follows (in millions):\nAmounts are reflected in the preceding tables based on the location of the taxing authorities.\nReconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate for operations is as follows:\n(1)\nThe net provision for the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily due to stronger foreign earnings relative to U.S. earnings and net Subpart F income.\n(2)\nThe net benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020, was primarily due to a net operating loss carryback allowed under the CARES Act, as well as a change in estimate from the prior year attributable to research and development credits.\nOn September 9, 2020, Corning obtained a\n100\n% controlling interest in HS LLC and an\n80.5\n% controlling interest in HSO LLC.  As a result, the deferred tax liability on the outside basis difference between book and tax basis for Corning’s investment in HS LLC and HSO LLC was adjusted by approximately $\n116\nmillion.\nRefer to Note 4 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nGenerally, Corning will indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings of: (1) any of its subsidiaries located in jurisdictions where Corning lacks the ability to repatriate its earnings, (2) any of its subsidiaries where Corning’s intention is to reinvest those earnings in operations, (3) legal entities for which Corning holds a non-controlling interest, (4) any subsidiaries with an accumulated deficit in earnings and profits, (5) any subsidiaries which have a positive earnings and profits balance but for which the entity lacks sufficient local statutory earnings or stock basis from which to make a distribution, or (6) future distribution would trigger a significant net cost to the U.S. shareholder.\n94\nDuring 2020, the Company distributed approximately $\n914\nmillion from foreign subsidiaries to their respective U.S. parent companies.  As of December 31, 2020, Corning has approximately $\n2\nbillion of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings.  It remains impracticable to calculate the tax cost of repatriating unremitted earnings which are considered indefinitely reinvested.\nThe tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):\nThe net deferred tax assets in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows (in millions):\nDetails on deferred tax assets for loss and tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2020 are as follows (in millions):\nThe following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):\n95\nDuring 2020, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) opened an audit for tax years 2015-2018. We do not expect additional material exposure for the tax years under audit. However, if upon conclusion of these matters, the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount materially different than our current position, our overall tax expense and effective tax rate could be materially impacted in the period of adjustment.\nThe additions for tax positions of prior years were primarily due to tax audits, development of tax court cases, and tax law changes in various jurisdictions.\nIncluded in the balance at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are $\n102\nmillion, $\n35\nmillion and $\n263\nmillion, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the Company’s effective tax rate if recognized.\nAccrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of tax expense.  For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 the amount recognized in interest expense and accrued for the payment of interest and penalties were not material.\nIt is possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change due to one or more of the following events during the next twelve months: audit activity, tax payments, or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various jurisdictions.  Corning believes that adequate tax reserves are provided for these matters.  However, if upon conclusion of these matters, the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount materially different than the current reserves, the Company’s overall tax expense and effective tax rate could be materially impacted in the period of adjustment.  As of December 31, 2020, the company is not expecting any significant movements in the uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months.\nCorning Incorporated, as the common parent company, and all\n80%-or-more-owned of its U.S. subsidiaries\njoin in the filing of consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns.  The statute of limitations is closed for all periods ending through December 31, 2012.  All returns for periods ended through December 31, 2014, have been audited by and settled with the IRS.\nCorning Incorporated and its U.S. subsidiaries file income tax returns on a combined, unitary or stand-alone basis in multiple state and local jurisdictions,\nwhich generally have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to 5 years\n.  Various state income tax returns are currently in the process of examination or administrative appeal. The Company does not expect any material proposed adjustments from any of these audits.\nCorning’s foreign subsidiaries file income tax returns in the countries where their operations are located.  Generally,\nthese countries have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to 10 years\n.  The statute of limitations is closed through the following years in these major jurisdictions:  China (2008), Japan (2012), Taiwan (2014) and South Korea (2013).\nCPM (“Corning Precision Materials”), a South Korean subsidiary, is currently appealing certain tax assessments and tax refund claims for tax years 2010 through 2018.  The Company is required to deposit the disputed tax amounts with the South Korean government as a condition of its appeal of any tax assessments.  We believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the appeal process, and as a result we have recorded a non-current receivable of $\n365\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 compared to a $\n415\nmillion non-current receivable and $\n33\nmillion current receivable as of December 31, 2019 for the amount on deposit with the South Korean government. The reduction of the net receivable balance is due primarily to refunds received upon the successful defense of one of our tax positions with the South Korean government.\n96\n9.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net of Accumulated Depreciation\nProperty, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation follow (in millions):\nApproximately $\n58\nmillion, $\n54\nmillion and $\n49\nmillion of interest costs were capitalized as part of property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nManufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals.  At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the recorded value of precious metals totaled $\n3.4\nbillion and $\n3.3\nbillion, respectively.\nDepletion expense for precious metals in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n24\nmillion, $\n16\nmillion and $\n14\nmillion, respectively.\n1\n0.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.  Goodwill relates to and is assigned directly to a specific reporting unit.  Reporting units are either operating segments or one level below the operating segment.  Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level.  Goodwill is reviewed for indicators of impairment quarterly or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.  Corning also performs a detailed quantitative impairment test every three years if no indicators suggest a test should be performed in the interim.  We use this calculation as quantitative validation of the qualitative process; this process does not represent an election to perform the quantitative impairment test in place of the qualitative review.\nThe qualitative process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long-term growth of our businesses and forecasting future cash flows.  If we are required to perform the quantitative impairment analysis, our valuation method is an “income approach” using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return.  Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.  If the fair value is less than the carrying value, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the fair value and carrying value.\n97\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, were as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nThe Company obtained a controlling interest in HSG during the third quarter of 2020.  Refer to Note 4 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this transaction.\nCorning’s gross goodwill balance and accumulated impairment losses were $\n9.0\nbillion and $\n6.5\nbillion, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Corning’s gross goodwill balance and accumulated impairment losses were $\n8.4\nbillion and $\n6.5\nbillion, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Accumulated impairment losses were generated primarily through goodwill impairments related to the Optical Communications segment.\nOther Intangible Assets\nOther intangible assets follow (in millions):\n(1)\nOther is comprised of intangible assets related to developed technologies and intellectual know-how.\nCorning’s amortized intangible assets are primarily related to the Optical Communications and Life Sciences segments and “All Other”.  The net carrying amount of intangible assets increased during the year, primarily driven by the consolidation of HSG and foreign currency translation and other adjustments of $\n14\nmillion; offset by amortization of $\n121\nmillion and an impairment of $\n55\nmillion. Intangible assets obtained from HSG consist primarily of $\n215\nmillion of developed technologies and know-how, and $\n70\nmillion of other intangibles that are amortized over the weighted average useful life of approximately\n20\nand\n15\nyears, respectively.\nAmortization expense related to all intangible assets is expected to be approximately $\n130\nmillion annually for years 2021 through 2025.\nRefer to Note 4 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n98\n11.\nOther Assets and Other Liabilities\nOther assets follow (in millions):\nSouth Korean tax deposits\nCPM is currently appealing certain tax assessments and tax refund claims for tax years 2010 through 2018.  The Company is required to deposit the disputed tax amounts with the South Korean government as a condition of its appeal of any tax assessments.  Corning believes that it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the appeal process.\n99\nOther liabilities follow (in millions):\n(1)\nThe negative carrying value resulted from a one-time charge to this entity in 2019 for the impairment of certain assets.  Refer to Note 3 (Investments) and Note 4 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n‎\n100\n12.\nDebt\n(In millions)\nBased on borrowing rates currently available to us for loans with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of long-term debt was $\n9.4\nbillion and $\n8.5\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The Company measures the fair value of its long-term debt using Level 2 inputs based primarily on current market yields for its existing debt traded in the secondary market.\nCorning did\nno\nt have outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nCorning maintains a revolving credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) which provides a committed $\n1.5\nbillion unsecured multi-currency line of credit and expires\nAugust 15, 2023\n.  At December 31, 2020, there were\nno\noutstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\n101\nThe following table shows debt maturities by year at December 31, 2020 (in millions)\n(1)\n:\n(1)\nExcludes interest rate swap gains, bond discounts and deferred expenses.\nDebt Issuances and Repayments\n2020\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, Corning redeemed $\n100\nmillion of\n7.0\n% debentures due in\n2024\nwith a carrying amount of $\n99\nmillion, paying a $\n21\nmillion make-whole call premium. The total payment of $\n121\nmillion is disclosed in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The redemption resulted in a loss of $\n22\nmillion.\nIn conjunction with the change in control of HSG on September 9, 2020, a variable interest rate loan of $\n175\nmillion USD, maturing on September 8, 2021, was made to DC HSC Holdings, LLC, now a consolidated subsidiary of Corning.\nIn December 2020, DC HSC Holdings, LLC repaid $\n100\nmillion of the loan.  The remaining balance of $\n75\nmillion is reflected in the current portion of long-term debt and short-term borrowings in Corning’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020.\nRefer to Note 4 (HSG Transactions) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, Corning established an incremental liquidity facility for\n25\nbillion Japanese yen, equivalent to $\n232\nmillion with a maturity of\nthree year\ns.  As of December 31, 2020, the facility has\nno\nt been drawn upon.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, Corning established two unsecured variable rate loan facilities for\n1,050\nmillion Chinese yuan, equivalent to $\n150\nmillion, and\n749\nmillion Chinese yuan, equivalent to $\n105\nmillion, each with a maturity of\nfive year\ns.  In the fourth quarter of 2020, Corning established a third unsecured variable rate loan facility for\n546\nmillion Chinese yuan, equivalent to $\n84\nmillion, with a maturity of\nfive year\ns.  Borrowings under these loan facilities for the year ended December 31, 2020, totaled\n1,691\nmillion Chinese yuan, or approximately $\n243\nmillion.  These Chinese yuan-denominated proceeds will not be converted into USD and will be used for capital projects.  Payments of principal and interest on the Notes will be in Chinese yuan, or should yuan be unavailable due to circumstances beyond Corning’s control, a USD equivalent.\nThese loans are the sole obligations of the subsidiary borrowers and are not guaranteed by any other Corning entity.\n2019\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Corning issued two USD-denominated debt securities (the “Notes”), as follows:\n\n$\n400\nmillion\n3.90\n% senior unsecured notes with a maturity of\n30 year\ns; and\n\n$\n1.1\nbillion\n5.45\n% senior unsecured notes with a maturity of\n60 year\ns.\nThe net proceeds, after deducting offering expenses, were approximately $\n1.5\nbillion and will be used for general corporate purposes.  These notes can be redeemed at any time, subject to certain terms and conditions.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Corning redeemed $\n300\nmillion of\n4.25\n% notes due in\n2020\n, paying a premium of $\n4.7\nmillion by exercising a make-whole call.\nThe bond redemption resulted in an $\n8.4\nmillion loss during the same quarter.\nIn the third quarter of 2019, Corning issued two Japanese yen-denominated debt securities (the “Notes”), as follows:\n\n¥\n31.3\nbillion\n1.153\n% senior unsecured notes with a maturity of\n12 year\ns; and\n\n¥\n5.9\nbillion\n1.513\n% senior unsecured notes with a maturity of\n20 year\ns.\n102\nThe proceeds from the Notes were received in Japanese yen and converted to USD on the date of issuance.  The net proceeds received in USD, after deducting offering expenses, were approximately $\n349\nmillion and will be used for general corporate purposes.  Payments of principal and interest on the Notes will be in Japanese yen, or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond Corning’s control, a USD equivalent.\nOn a quarterly basis, Corning will recognize the foreign currency translation gains and losses resulting from changes in exchanges rates within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.  Cash proceeds from loans and debt issuances are disclosed as financing activities, and cash payments for interest are disclosed as operating activities, in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n13.\nEmployee Retirement Plans\nDefined Benefit Plans\nCorning has defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees.  The Company’s funding policy has been to contribute, as necessary, an amount exceeding the minimum requirements to achieve the Company’s long-term funding targets.  In 2020, voluntary cash contributions were made to domestic defined benefit pension plans and international pension plans in the amount of $\n180\nmillion and $\n41\nmillion, respectively.  In 2019,\nno\nvoluntary contributions were made to domestic defined benefit pension plans.  Voluntary cash contributions of $\n2\nmillion were made to international pension plans.  During 2021, the Company plans to make cash contributions of $\n31\nmillion to international pension plans.\nCorning offers postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for retirees and eligible dependents.  Certain employees may become eligible for such postretirement benefits upon reaching retirement age and service requirements.  In 2020, voluntary cash contributions were made to domestic postretirement plans in the amount of $\n30\nmillion.  For current retirees (including surviving spouses) and active employees eligible for the salaried retiree medical program, Corning has placed a “cap” on the amount to be contributed toward retiree medical coverage in the future.  The cap is equal to\n120\n% of the 2005 contributions toward retiree medical benefits.  Once contributions toward salaried retiree medical costs reach this cap, impacted retirees will have to pay the excess amount in addition to their regular contributions for coverage.  This cap was attained for post-65 retirees in 2008 and attained for pre-65 retirees in 2010.  Furthermore, employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2007 will be eligible for Corning retiree medical benefits upon retirement; however, these employees will pay\n100\n% of the cost.\n‎\n103\nObligations and Funded Status\nThe change in benefit obligation and funded status of our defined benefit pension plans are as follows (in millions):\nAn actuarial loss of $\n358\nmillion was recognized in 2020 primarily due to decreases in bond yields during the year, leading to a domestic plan weighted-average discount rate that was\n78\nbasis points lower than the prior year.  In 2019, an actuarial loss of $\n533\nmillion was recognized primarily due to decreases in bond yields during the year, leading to a domestic plan weighted-average discount rate that was\n100\nbasis points lower than the prior year.  The accumulated benefit obligation for defined benefit pension plans was $\n4.7\nbillion and $\n4.3\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n104\nThe following information is presented for pension plans where the projected benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets (in millions):\nIn 2020 and 2019, the fair value of plan assets exceeded the projected benefit obligation for the United Kingdom pension plan.\nThe following information is presented for pension plans where the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets (in millions):\nIn 2020 and 2019, the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation for the United Kingdom and South Korea pension plans.\n‎\n105\nThe change in benefit obligation and funded status of our postretirement plans are as follows (in millions):\nAn actuarial loss of $\n58\nmillion was recognized in 2020 due to current year decreases in bond yields, leading to a weighted-average discount rate that was\n72\nbasis points lower than the prior year.  In 2019, an actuarial loss of $\n6\nmillion was recognized due to decreases in bond yields during the year, leading to a weighted-average discount rate that was\n92\nbasis points lower than the prior year.\n106\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost for employee retirement plans are presented in the following tables (in millions):\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost other than the service cost component are included in the line item other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of income.\n107\nCorning uses a hypothetical yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the plan’s projected benefit payments.  Once the present value of projected benefit payments is calculated, the suggested discount rate is equal to the level rate that results in the same present value.  The yield curve is based on actual high-quality corporate bonds across the full maturity spectrum, which also includes private placements and eurobonds that are denominated in U.S. currency.  The curve is developed from yields on hundreds of bonds from four grading sources, Moody’s, S&P, Fitch and the Dominion Bond Rating Service.  A bond will be included if at least half of the grades from these sources are Aa, non-callable bonds.  The very highest\n10\n% yields and the lowest\n40\n% yields are excluded from the curve to eliminate outliers in the bond population.\nMortality is one of the key assumptions used in valuing liabilities of retirement plans.  It is used to assign a probability of payment for benefits that are contingent upon participants’ survival.  To make this assumption, benefit plan sponsors typically use a base mortality table and an improvement scale to mortality rates for future anticipated changes to historical death rates.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Corning updated the adjustment factors applied to its base mortality assumption (PRI-2012 white collar table and PRI-2012 blue collar table for non-union and union participants, respectively) to value its U.S. benefit plan obligations as of December 31, 2020.  In addition, Corning also updated to the MP-2020 projection scale at year-end 2020.  As the Society of Actuaries publishes additional mortality improvement scales (i.e. MP-2020) and base mortality tables (i.e. PRI-2012), each year Corning considers these revised schedules in setting its mortality assumptions.  Furthermore, Corning updated for the year ended 2020 the mortality assumption applied to disabled participants to be the PRI-2012 disabled mortality base table with future improvements using MP-2020.\nMeasurement of postretirement benefit expense is based on assumptions used to value the postretirement benefit obligation at the beginning of the year.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended December 31 were as follows:\nExpected long-term returns on plan assets is based on long-term expectations for future returns informed by historical data in conjunction with the investment policies further described within “Plan Assets” below.  Reasonableness of the results is tested using models provided by the plan actuaries.\n108\nPlan Assets\nThe Company’s primary objective is to ensure the plan has sufficient return on assets to fund the plan’s current and future obligations as they become due.  Investments are primarily made in public securities to ensure adequate liquidity to support benefit payments.  Domestic and international stocks provide diversification to the portfolio.  The target allocation range equity investment is\n40\n% which includes large, mid and small-cap companies and investments in both developed and emerging markets.  The target allocation for bond investments is\n60\n%, which predominately includes corporate bonds.  Long-duration fixed income assets are utilized to mitigate the sensitivity of funding ratios to changes in interest rates.\nThe following tables provide fair value measurement information for the Company’s major categories; Level 1 (quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets), Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) and Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) of domestic defined benefit plan assets:\n(1)\nThis category includes venture capital, leverage buyouts and distressed debt limited partnerships invested primarily in U.S. companies.  The inputs are valued by discounted cash flow analysis and comparable sale analysis.\n(2)\nThis category includes industrial, office, apartments, hotels, infrastructure and retail investments which are limited partnerships predominately in the U.S.  The inputs are valued by discounted cash flow analysis; comparable sale analysis and periodic external appraisals.\nThe following tables provide fair value measurement information for the Company’s major categories; Level 1 (quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets), Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) and Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) of international defined benefit plan assets:\n109\nThe following table sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the defined benefit plans Level 3 assets:\nCredit Risk\n58\n% of domestic plan assets are invested in long duration bonds.  The average rating for these bonds is A-.  These bonds are subject to both credit and default risk and changes in the risk could lead to a decline in the value of these bonds.\nCurrency Risk\n12\n% of domestic assets are valued in non-U.S. dollar denominated investments that are subject to currency fluctuations.  The value of these securities will decline if the U.S. dollar increases in value relative to the value of the currencies in which these investments are denominated.\nLiquidity Risk\n5\n% of the domestic securities are invested in Level 3 securities.  These are long-term investments in private equity and private real estate investments that may not mature or be sellable in the near-term without significant loss.\nAt December 31, 20\n20\nand 2019, the amount of Corning common stock included in equity securities was not significant.\nCash Flow Data\nThe following reflects the gross benefit payments that are expected to be paid for domestic and international defined benefit pension plans and the postretirement medical and life plans (in millions):\nOther Benefit Plans\nCorning offers defined contribution plans covering employees meeting certain eligibility requirements.  Total consolidated defined contribution plan expense was $\n76\nmillion, $\n108\nmillion and $\n67\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n110\n14.\nCommitments, Contingencies and Guarantees\nThe amounts of obligations are as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had stand-by letters of credit commitments of $\n121\nmillion; $\n39\nmillion was included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(2)\nPurchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations which primarily consist of raw material and energy-related take-or-pay contracts.\n(3)\nCapital expenditure obligations primarily reflect amounts associated with capital expansion activities.\n(4)\nDebentures are stated at maturity value and excludes interest rate swap gains or losses and bond discounts.\n(5)\nThe estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity or expiration of the related debt, based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments.\n(6)\nAt December 31, 2020, $\n35\nmillion was included on the consolidated balance sheets related to uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company is required, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes.  In the normal course of business, the Company does not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees.  Generally, third-party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones.  These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant.  The Company believes a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded.\nProduct warranty liability accruals at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were insignificant.\nThe ability of certain subsidiaries and affiliated companies to transfer funds is limited by provisions of foreign government regulations, affiliate agreements and certain loan agreements.  At December 31, 2020, the amount of equity subject to such restrictions for consolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies was not significant.  While this amount is legally restricted, it does not result in operational difficulties since the Company has generally permitted subsidiaries to retain a majority of equity to support growth programs.\nCorning is a defendant in various lawsuits and is subject to various claims that arise in the normal course of business, the most significant of which are summarized below.  In the opinion of management, the likelihood that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on Corning’s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, is remote.\n111\nAsbestos Claims\nCorning and PPG Industries, Inc. each owned\n50\n% of the capital stock of Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (“PCC”).  PCC filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in 2000 and the Modified Third Amended Plan of Reorganization for PCC (the “Plan”) became effective in April 2016.  At December 31, 2016, the Company’s liability under the Plan was $\n290\nmillion, which was required to be paid through a series of fixed payments beginning in the second quarter of 2017.  Payments of $\n130\nmillion and $\n50\nmillion were made in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  As of December 31, 2020, there is\nno\nfurther liability associated with this plan.\nNon-PCC Asbestos Claims\nCorning is a defendant in certain cases alleging injuries from asbestos unrelated to PCC (the “non-PCC asbestos claims”) which had been stayed pending the confirmation of the Plan.  The stay was lifted on August 25, 2016.  At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of the reserve for these non-PCC asbestos claims was estimated to be $\n96\nmillion and $\n98\nmillion, respectively.  The reserve balance as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 represents the undiscounted projection of claims and related legal fees for the estimated life of the litigation.\nDow Corning Chapter 11 Related Matters\nUntil June 1, 2016, Corning and The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”) each owned\n50\n% of the common stock of Dow Corning Corporation (“Dow Corning”).  On May 31, 2016, Corning and Dow realigned their ownership interest in Dow Corning.  Following the realignment, Corning no longer owned any interest in Dow Corning.  With the realignment, Corning agreed to indemnify Dow for\n50\n% of Dow Corning’s non-ordinary course, pre-closing liabilities to the extent such liabilities exceed the amounts reserved for them by Dow Corning as of May 31, 2016, subject to certain conditions and limits.\nDow Corning Breast Implant Litigation\nIn May 1995, Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousands of breast implant product lawsuits.  On June 1, 2004, Dow Corning emerged from Chapter 11 with a Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan”) which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims.  The Plan includes releases for Corning and Dow as shareholders in exchange for contributions to the Plan.\nUnder the terms of the Plan, Dow Corning has established and funded a Settlement Trust and a Litigation Facility, referred to above, to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate their claims.  Inclusive of insurance, Dow Corning has paid approximately $\n1.8\nbillion to the Settlement Trust.  As of May 31, 2016, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of $\n290\nmillion.  In the event Dow Corning’s total liability for these claims exceeds such amount, Corning may be required to indemnify Dow for up to\n50\n% of the excess liability, subject to certain conditions and limits.  As of December 31, 2020, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of $\n160\nmillion.  As a result, Corning does not believe its indemnity obligation for Dow Corning’s breast implant litigation liability, if any, will be material.\nDow Corning Bankruptcy Pendency Interest Claims\nAs a separate matter arising from the bankruptcy proceedings, Dow Corning has been defending claims asserted by commercial creditors who claimed additional compounded interest at default and state statutory judgment rates as well as attorneys’ fees and other enforcement costs, during the period from May 1995 through June 2004.  As of May 31, 2016, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for these claims of $\n107\nmillion.  Dow Corning settled those claims as of September 30, 2019 and received approval of the settlement from the bankruptcy court.  Corning does not believe its indemnity obligation, if any, for Dow Corning’s liability to be material.\n112\nDow Corning Environmental Claims\nIn September 2019, Dow formally notified Corning of certain environmental matters for which Dow asserts that it has or will experience losses arising from remediation and response at a number of sites.  In the event Dow is liable for these claims, Corning may be required to indemnify Dow for up to\n50\n% of that liability, subject to certain conditions and limits.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Corning has determined a potential liability for these environmental matters is probable, and the amount recorded was not material.\nEnvironmental Litigation\nCorning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the Agency) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible\nparty for\n15\nactive hazardous\nwaste sites.\nUnder the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise.  It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.  At December 31, 20\n20\nand 2019, Corning had accrued approximately $\n68\nmillion and $\n41\nmillion, respectively, for the undiscounted estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.  Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.\n15.\nHedging Activities\nCorning is exposed to interest rate and foreign currency risks due to the movement of these rates.\nThe areas in which exchange rate fluctuations affect the Company include:\n\nFinancial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies, which impact earnings; and\n\nThe translation of net assets in foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\nThe most significant foreign currency exposure relates to the Japanese yen, South Korean won, new Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan, the euro and British pound.  Corning seeks to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts.  In general, these hedge expirations coincide with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions.\nCorning is exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these derivative contracts.  However, this risk is minimized by maintaining a portfolio with a diverse group of highly-rated major financial institutions.  The Company does not expect to record any losses due to counterparty default.  Neither the company nor its counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments.  The Company qualified for and elected the end-user exception to the mandatory swap clearing requirement of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nCash Flow Hedges\nCorning’s cash flow hedging activities utilize OTC foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to customers and purchases from suppliers.  The total gross notional values for foreign currency cash flow hedges are $\n1.1\nbillion, including net investment hedges of $\n251\nmillion, and $\n2.1\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with maturities spanning the years 2021 through 2023.\nCorning uses regression analysis or critical term match method to assess initial hedge effectiveness.  Following the inception of a hedging relationship, hedge effectiveness is assessed quarterly based on qualitative factors.  Corning defers gains and losses related to the cash flow hedges into accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until the hedged item impacts earnings.  At December 31, 2020, the amount expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months is a pre-tax net gain of $\n35\nmillion.\n113\nIn the first quarter of 2020, a loss of $\n14\nmillion was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into other expense, net, due to the de-designation of certain cash flow hedges related to Japanese yen-denominated sales.\nThe effect of cash flow hedges on Coring’s consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income was not material for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nUndesignated Hedges\nCorning also uses OTC foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedged instruments for accounting purposes.  These contracts are used to offset economic currency risks.  The undesignated hedges limit exposure to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets, monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies.\nA significant portion of the Company’s non-U.S. revenue and expenses are denominated in Japanese yen, South Korean won, new Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan and euro.  When this revenue and these expenses are translated back to U.S. dollars, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements.  To protect translated earnings against movements in these currencies, the Company has entered into a series of average rate forwards and other derivative instruments.\nThe table below includes a total gross notional value for translated earnings contracts of $\n7.5\nbillion and $\n12.2\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These include gross notional value for average rate forward contracts of $\n5.4\nbillion and $\n9.7\nbillion, zero-cost collars and purchased put or call options of $\n2.0\nbillion and $\n2.5\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The majority of average rate forward contracts hedge a significant portion of the Company’s exposure to the Japanese yen with maturities spanning the years 2021-2024 and with gross notional values of $\n4.5\nbillion and $\n7.7\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The average rate forward contracts also partially hedge the impacts of the South Korean won, Chinese yuan, euro, new Taiwan dollar and British pound translation on the Company’s projected net income.\nThe fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain position) or liabilities (loss position) on the consolidated balance sheets.  Changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts are recorded currently in earnings in the translated earnings contract (loss) gain, net line of the consolidated statements of income.\nThe following table summarizes the notional amounts and respective fair values of Corning’s derivative financial instruments on a gross basis for December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\n(1)\nAt December 31, 2020, the foreign exchange contracts that are designated as hedging instruments include the notional amount $\n892\nmillion of cash flow hedges and $\n251\nmillion of net investment hedges.\n114\nThe following tables summarize the effect on the consolidated financial statements relating to Corning’s derivative financial instruments (in millions):\n(1)\nA loss of $\n14\nmillion was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into other expense, net, resulting from the de-designation of certain cash flow hedges.\n16.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value standards under U.S. GAAP define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value in applying generally accepted accounting principles, and require disclosures about fair value measurements.  The standards also identify two kinds of inputs that are used to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable.  Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the Company’s own market assumptions.  Once inputs have been characterized, the inputs are prioritized into one of three broad levels (provided in the table below) used to measure fair value.  Fair value standards apply whenever an entity is measuring fair value under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement and require the use of observable market data when available.\nThe following tables provide fair value measurement information for the Company’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis:\n(1)\nDerivative assets and liabilities include foreign exchange contracts which are measured using observable inputs for similar assets and liabilities.\n(2)\nIncluded in other current assets and other assets is a contingent consideration asset for a cost adjustment contract of $\n20\nmillion, resulting from the HSG Transactions as of September 9, 2020, that were measured using unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\n(3)\nIncluded in the investments were equity securities with readily available fair values that were measured using Level 1 inputs.  A pre-tax gain of $\n107\nmillion was recognized from the initial public offering of an investment for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n115\n(1)\nDerivative assets and liabilities include foreign exchange contracts which are measured using observable inputs for similar assets and liabilities.\n(2)\nOther assets include one of the Company’s renewable energy derivative contracts that was measured using unobservable (Level 3) inputs, in the amount of $\n21\nmillion.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, assets and liabilities that were measured using unobservable (Level 3) inputs resulted in losses recognized in earnings of $\n21\nmillion for a renewable energy derivative contract and $\n4\nmillion for auction rate securities, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, assets and liabilities that were measured using unobservable (Level 3) inputs resulted in unrealized gains recognized in earnings of $\n21\nmillion for a renewable energy derivative contract\nand the reversal of a liability for contingent consideration of $\n20\nmillion.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Corning incurred a long-lived asset impairment and disposal loss for an asset group related to the reassessment of research and development programs within “All Other”. Given the economic environment and market opportunities, Corning discontinued its investment in these research and development programs. The impairment analysis and disposition of certain assets resulted in a total pre-tax charge of $\n217\nmillion, which was substantially all the carrying value, inclusive of an insignificant amount of goodwill. The fair value of the asset group for the impairment analysis was measured using unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\nRefer to Note 2 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and Credits) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information this impairment.\nAt December 31, 2019, HSG, one of the Company’s equity method affiliates, recorded an impairment of its long-lived assets.  HSG engaged a third-party appraiser to assist in determining the fair value of its long-lived assets using unobservable (Level 3) inputs based on the highest and best use of the asset group. As a result, HSG recognized pre-tax asset impairment charges of $\n916\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Corning’s share of the pre-tax impairment was $\n369\nmillion. For the year ended December 31, 2020, no material asset impairment losses were recognized on a nonrecurring basis by HSG.  Refer to Note 3 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nFair value measurements (Level 3) related to the Redemption are disclosed in Note 4 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements. There were no other significant financial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n116\n17.\nShareholders’ Equity\nCommon Stock Dividends\nOn February 3, 2021, Corning’s Board of Directors declared a\n9\n% increase in the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $\n0.22\nto $\n0.24\nper share of common stock, beginning with the dividend paid in the first quarter of 2021.  This increase marks the tenth dividend increase since October 2011.\nOn February 5, 2020, Corning’s Board of Directors declared a\n10\n% increase in the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $\n0.20\nto $\n0.22\nper share of common stock, beginning with the dividend paid in the first quarter of 2020.\nOn February 6, 2019, Corning’s Board of Directors declared an\n11\n% increase in the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $\n0.18\nto $\n0.20\nper share of common stock, beginning with the dividend paid in the first quarter of 2019.\nFixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A\nOn January 15, 2014, Corning designated a new series of its preferred stock as Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $\n100\nper share, and issued\n1,900\nshares of preferred stock at an issue price of $\n1\nmillion per share, for an aggregate issue price of $\n1.9\nbillion, to Samsung Display with the acquisition of its equity interest in Samsung Corning Precision Materials.  Corning also issued to Samsung Display an additional amount of preferred stock at closing, for an aggregate issue price of $\n400\nmillion in cash.\nDividends on the preferred stock are cumulative and accrue at the annual rate of\n4.25\n% on the per share issue price of $\n1\nmillion.  The dividends are payable quarterly as and when declared by the Company’s Board of Directors.  The preferred stock ranks senior to common stock with respect to payment of dividends and rights upon liquidation.  The preferred stock is not redeemable except in the case of a certain deemed liquidation event, the occurrence of which is under the control of the Company.  The preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder, and by the Company upon certain events, at a conversion rate of\n50,000\nshares of Corning’s common stock per one share of preferred stock, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions.  As of December 31, 2020, the preferred stock had not been converted, and none of the anti-dilution provisions had been triggered.  On January 16, 2021, the preferred stock became convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder.  The Company has the right, at its option, to cause some or all the shares of preferred stock to be converted into common stock, if, for\n25\ntrading days (whether or not consecutive) within any period of\n40\nconsecutive trading days, the closing price of common stock exceeds $\n35\nper share.  The preferred stock does not have any voting rights except as may be required by law.\nShare Repurchases\n2020 Share Repurchases\nThe Company suspended share buybacks during the first quarter of 2020 and made no share repurchases for the remainder of the year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased\n4.1\nmillion shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $\n105\nmillion, as part of its 2018 Repurchase Program.\n2019 Share Repurchases\nOn July 17, 2019, Corning’s Board of Directors authorized $\n5\nbillion in share repurchases with no expiration date (the “2019 Repurchase Program”).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased\n31.0\nmillion shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $\n925\nmillion as part of its 2018 Repurchase Program.\n2018 Share Repurchases\nOn April 26, 2018, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $\n2\nbillion share repurchase program with no expiration (the “2018 Repurchase Program”).  During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased\n74.8\nmillion shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $\n2.2\nbillion as part of its 2016 and 2018 Repurchase Programs.\n117\nThe following table presents changes in capital stock (in millions):\n118\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nA summary of changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, including the proportionate share of equity method investee’s accumulated other comprehensive loss, is as follows (in millions)\n(1)\n:\n(1)\nAll amounts are after tax.  Amounts in parentheses indicate debits to accumulated other comprehensive income.\n(2)\nAmounts are net of total tax benefit of $\n64\nmillion, primarily driven by $\n34\nmillion and $\n33\nmillion, related to foreign currency translation adjustments and retirement plans, respectively.\n(3)\nAmounts are net of total tax benefit of $\n8\nmillion, primarily driven by $\n7\nmillion related to foreign currency translation adjustments; embedded in this number is the negative impact of $\n18\nmillion related to the hedging component, offset by the positive impact of $\n19\nmillion related to retirement plans.\n(4)\nAmounts are net of total tax expense of $\n22\nmillion, primarily driven by $\n55\nmillion related to foreign currency translation adjustments; embedded in this number are the positive impacts of $\n5\nmillion related to the hedging component and $\n28\nmillion related to retirement plans.\n(5)\nTax effect of reclassifications are disclosed separately within this footnote.\n(6)\nTax effects related to equity method affiliates are not significant in the reported periods.\n‎\n119\n(In millions)\n(1)\nAmounts in parentheses indicate debits to the statement of income.\n(2)\nThese accumulated other comprehensive income components are included in net periodic pension cost.  Refer to Note 13 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n(3)\nIncludes $\n52\nmillion that was recognized during the first quarter of 2019 due to adoption of the new standard related to Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, which allows for reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects.\n‎\n120\n18.\nEarnings Per Common Share\nBasic earnings per common share are computed by dividing income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted earnings per common share assumes the issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive securities outstanding.\nThe reconciliation of the amounts used to compute basic and diluted earnings per common share from operations is as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):\n(1)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Series A preferred stock was anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share\n.\n19.\nShare-Based Compensation\nCorning maintains long-term incentive plans (the “Plans”) for key employees and non-employee members of its Board of Directors.  The Plans allow us to grant equity-based compensation awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance share units, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards or a combination of awards (collectively, share-based awards).  At December 31, 2020, there were approximately\n36\nmillion unissued common shares available for future grants authorized under the Plans.\nBeginning in 2020, Corning increased the equity component in its Long-Term Incentive (“LTI”) Plan from\n40\n% to\n75\n% of an executive’s annual targeted compensation opportunity.\nShare-based compensation cost is allocated to the selling, general and administrative, research, development and engineering, and cost of sales expenses lines in the consolidated statements of income.\n‎\n121\nStock Compensation Plans\nThe Company measures and recognizes compensation cost for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.\nThe fair value of awards granted that are expected to ultimately vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods.  The number of options expected to vest equals the total options granted less an estimation of the number of forfeitures expected to occur prior to vesting.  The forfeiture rate is calculated based on\n15\nyears of historical data and is adjusted if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimates.  The effect of any change in estimated forfeitures would be recognized through a cumulative adjustment that would be included in compensation cost in the period of the change in estimate.\nTotal share-based compensation cost was approximately $\n207\nmillion, $\n56\nmillion and $\n51\nmillion, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.  The incremental change in expense of $\n151\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020, was driven primarily by a larger equity component for Director and Executive compensation, issuance of employee share-based compensation awards and the acceleration of vesting of options on December 3, 2020.\nThe income tax benefit realized from share-based compensation was $\n12\nmillion, $\n9\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.  Refer to Note 8 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nStock Options\nCorning’s stock option plans provide non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase authorized but unissued common shares, or treasury shares, at the market price on the grant date and generally become exercisable in installments from\none year\nto\nfive year\ns from the grant date.  The maximum term of non-qualified and incentive stock options is\n10\nyears from the grant date.  An award is considered vested when the employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service (the “non-substantive vesting period approach”).\nThe following table summarizes information concerning stock options outstanding, including the related transactions under the stock option plans for the year ended December 31, 2020:\nThe aggregate intrinsic value (market value of stock less option exercise price) in the preceding table represents the total pretax intrinsic value, based on the Company’s closing stock price on December 31, 2020, which would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their “in-the-money” options as of that date.  The total number of “in-the-money” options exercisable on December 31, 2020, was approximately\n9\nmillion.\n‎\n122\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value for options granted for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n3.67\n, $\n8.78\nand $\n7.17\n, respectively.  The total fair value of options that vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $\n31\nmillion, $\n10\nmillion and $\n12\nmillion, respectively.  Compensation cost related to stock options for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, was approximately $\n23\nmillion, $\n13\nmillion and $\n12\nmillion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $\n21\nmillion of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options granted under the Plans.  The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n2.2\nyears.\nProceeds received from the exercise of stock options were $\n124\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020.  The total intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $\n99\nmillion, $\n47\nmillion and $\n66\nmillion, respectively.\nCorning uses a multiple-point Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants.  Corning utilizes a blended approach for calculating the volatility assumption used in the multiple-point Black-Scholes valuation model defined as the weighted average of the short-term implied volatility, the most recent volatility for the period equal to the expected term, and the most recent\n15\n-year historical volatility.  The expected term is the period the options are expected to be outstanding and is calculated using a combination of historical exercise experience adjusted to reflect the current vesting period of options being valued, and partial life cycles of outstanding options.  The risk-free rates used in the multiple-point Black-Scholes valuation model are the implied rates for a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a term equal to the option’s expected term.  The ranges given below reflect results from separate groups of employees exhibiting different exercise behavior.\nThe following inputs were used for the valuation of option grants under the stock option plans:\nIncentive Stock Plans\nThe Corning Incentive Stock Plan permits restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants, either determined by specific performance goals or issued directly, in most instances, subject to the possibility of forfeiture and without cash consideration.  Restricted stock and restricted stock units under the Incentive Stock Plan are granted at the closing market price on the grant date, contingently vest over a period of generally\none year\nto\nten year\ns, and generally have contractual lives of\none year\nto\nten year\ns.  The fair value of each restricted stock grant or restricted stock unit awarded under the Incentive Stock Plan is based on the grant date closing price of the Company’s stock.\nTime-Based Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\nTime-based restricted stock and restricted stock units are issued by the Company on a discretionary basis, and are payable in shares of the Company’s common stock upon vesting. The fair value is based on the closing market price of the Company’s stock on the grant date. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite vesting period and adjusted for actual forfeitures before vesting.\n123\nThe following table represents a summary of the status of the Company’s non-vested time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units as of December 31, 2019 and changes which occurred during the year ended December 31, 2020:\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $\n149\nmillion of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units compensation arrangements granted under the Plan.  The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n2.4\nyears.  The total fair value of time-based restricted stock that vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $\n38\nmillion, $\n33\nmillion and $\n31\nmillion, respectively.  Compensation cost related to time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units was approximately $\n95\nmillion, $\n43\nmillion and $\n39\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Units\nPerformance-based restricted stock units are earned upon the achievement of certain targets, and are payable in shares of the Company’s common stock upon vesting typically over a\nthree year\nperiod.  The weighted-average grant date fair value is based on the market price of the Company’s stock on the grant date and assumes that the target payout level will be achieved.  Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite vesting period and adjusted for actual forfeitures before vesting.  During the performance period, compensation cost may be adjusted based on changes in the expected outcome of the performance-related target.\nThe following table summarizes information concerning the Company’s non-vested performance-based restricted stock units, including the related transactions under the performance-based restricted stock units plan for the year ended December 31, 2020:\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $\n32\nmillion of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested performance-based restricted stock units compensation arrangements granted under the Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n2.0\nyears.\nCompensation cost related to performance-based restricted stock units for the year ended December 31, 2020, was approximately $\n81\nmillion, largely driven by retirement-eligible employees.\n‎\n124\n20.\nReportable Segments\nReportable segments are as follows:\n\nDisplay Technologies – manufactures glass substrates for flat panel liquid crystal displays and other high-performance display panels.\n\nOptical Communications – manufactures carrier network and enterprise network components for the telecommunications industry.\n\nSpecialty Materials – manufactures products that provide more than\n150\nmaterial formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs.\n\nEnvironmental Technologies – manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel applications.\n\nLife Sciences – manufactures glass and plastic labware, equipment, media, serum and reagents enabling workflow solutions for drug discovery and bioproduction.\nAll other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “All Other.”  This group is primarily comprised of the results of the pharmaceutical technologies, auto glass and new product lines and development projects, as well as other businesses and certain corporate investments.\nThe Company obtained a controlling interest in HSG during the third quarter of 2020 and has consolidated results in “All Other” as of September 9, 2020.  Refer to Note 4 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on this transaction.\nFinancial results for the reportable segments are prepared on a basis consistent with the internal disaggregation of financial information to assist the CODM in making internal operating decisions.  The impact of changes in the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and new Taiwan dollar are excluded from segment sales and segment net income for the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.  The impact of changes in the euro and Chinese yuan are excluded from segment sales and segment net income for the Environment Technologies segment.  The impact of changes in the euro, Chinese yuan and Japanese yen are excluded from segment sales and segment net income for the Life Sciences segment.  Certain income and expenses are included in the unallocated amounts in the reconciliation of reportable segment net income (loss) to consolidated net income.  These include items that are not used by the CODM in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to the segments and include the following items:  the impact of the translated earnings contracts; acquisition-related costs; discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments; certain litigation, regulatory and other legal matters; restructuring, impairment losses and other charges and credits; adjustments relating to acquisitions; and other non-recurring non-operational items.  Although these amounts are excluded from segment results, they are included in reported consolidated results.\nEarnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with the reportable segments are included in the respective segment’s net income (loss).  Certain common expenses among reportable segments have been allocated differently than they would for stand-alone financial information.  Segment net income (loss) may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.\n125\nThe following provides historical segment information as described above:\nSegment Information\n(in millions)\n(1)\nDepreciation expense for Corning’s reportable segments includes an allocation of depreciation of corporate property not specifically identifiable to a segment.\n(2)\nResearch, development and engineering expenses include direct project spending that is identifiable to a segment.\n(3)\nIncome tax (provision) benefit reflects a tax rate of\n21\n%.\n(4)\nMany of Corning’s administrative and staff functions are performed on a centralized basis.
