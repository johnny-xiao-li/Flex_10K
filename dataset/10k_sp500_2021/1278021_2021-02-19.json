    "text": "Overview\nMarketAxess Holdings Inc. (the “Company” or “MarketAxess”) operates leading electronic trading platforms delivering expanded liquidity opportunities, improved execution quality and significant cost savings across global fixed-income markets. Over 1,800 institutional investor and broker-dealer firms are active users of our patented trading technology, accessing global liquidity on our platforms in U.S. investment-grade bonds, U.S. high-yield bonds, U.S. Treasuries, municipal bonds, emerging market debt, Eurobonds and other fixed income securities. Through our Open Trading™ protocols, we execute bond trades between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients in our leading all-to-all anonymous trading environment. We also offer a number of trading-related products and services, including: Composite+™ pricing and other market data products to assist clients with trading decisions; auto-execution and other execution services for clients requiring specialized workflow solutions; connectivity solutions that facilitate straight-through processing; and technology services to optimize trading environments. In addition, we provide a range of pre- and post-trade services, including trade matching, trade publication, regulatory transaction reporting and market and reference data across a range of fixed-income and other products.\nOur platforms’ innovative technology solutions are designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties and create a menu of solutions to address different trade sizes and bond liquidity characteristics. Our traditional Request-For-Quote (“RFQ”) model allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing, executable bids or offers from our broker-dealer clients and execute trades with the broker-dealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond. Our anonymous trading protocols (referred to throughout as “Open Trading”) complement our RFQ model by increasing the number of potential counterparties and improving liquidity by allowing all participants to interact anonymously in an all-to-all trading environment. Clients can use our auto-execution technology with both our traditional RFQ and Open Trading protocols, thereby using rules-based execution to connect to diverse sources of liquidity while reducing trading inefficiencies and human errors. Live Markets, an order book that provides a single view of two-way, actionable prices for the most active corporate bonds, including newly issued debt, benchmark issues and news-driven securities, leverages the benefits of our Open Trading marketplace and allows participants to efficiently trade liquid names in larger size.\nOur services relating to trade execution range from providing a suite of trading protocols designed to fit the trading needs of our clients to innovative new trading technologies, such as auto-execution and the use of artificial intelligence, to assist our clients’ trading decisions. Trading protocols include single and multiple-dealer inquiries; list trading, which is the ability to request bids and offers on up to 200 bonds at the same time; portfolio trading, which allows clients to competitively trade baskets of up to 1,500 securities; and swap trading, which is the ability to request an offer to purchase one bond and a bid to sell another bond. Auto-execution allows clients to set eligibility criteria for their orders that our system will use to determine whether or not to execute a trade in accordance with the pre-defined parameters. Once a trade is completed, clients will settle the trade with the assistance of our automated post-trade messaging, which facilitates the communication of trade acknowledgment and allocation information between our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients.\nWe are not a party to any of the disclosed trades that occur on our platforms between institutional investor clients and broker-dealer clients; rather, we serve as an intermediary between broker-dealers and institutional investors, enabling them to meet, agree on a price and then transact directly with each other. However, in connection with our Open Trading and other anonymous protocols, we execute bond transactions between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in matching back-to-back trades. In 2020, 32.7% of all credit volume on the MarketAxess platform was executed via Open Trading protocols, up from 26.3% in 2019.\n3\nOur broker-dealer clients accounted for approximately\n98.5\n% of the underwriting of newly-issued U.S. corporate bonds and approximately\n86.4\n% of the underwriting of newly\nissued European corporate bonds in\n2020\n. Although institutional investors, specialist market-making firms, proprietary trading firms and other non-traditional liquidity providers have increasingly provided liquidity on our platform\ns\nthrough Open Trading, we believe these broker-dealers still represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in the markets in which we operate. Secondary market liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy or sell a security quickly and in large volume\nfollowing\nthe original issuance of the security, without substantially affecting the price of the security.\nIn 2020, our volume in U.S. high-grade and high yield corporate bonds represented approximately 21.6% and 14.6%, respectively, of the total estimated U.S. high-grade and high yield corporate bond volumes, as reported by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (“TRACE”). TRACE facilitates the mandatory reporting of over-the-counter (“OTC”) secondary market transactions in eligible fixed-income securities in the U.S., including trading between institutional investors and broker-dealers, as well as inter-dealer and retail trading. All broker-dealers that are FINRA member firms have an obligation to report transactions in corporate bonds to TRACE under a set of rules approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nWe provide trade matching and regulatory reporting services for European investment firms and market and reference data across a range of fixed-income products. In response to the pre-and post-trade transparency mandates from the recast Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID II”) in Europe, we have been authorized by each of the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) and the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (“AFM”) as an Approved Publication Arrangement (“APA”) and an Approved Reporting Mechanism (“ARM”). In addition to our APA and ARM reporting services, we have developed a comprehensive suite of value-add solutions for MiFID II, including pre-trade transparency services, systematic internaliser (“SI”) determination and monitoring, best execution reporting, commodity position reporting, data quality analysis and peer benchmarking.\nIn 2020, 92.1% of our revenues were derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platforms. We also derive revenues from information services, post-trade services and other income. Our revenue can be impacted by seasonal effects caused by increased levels of new bond issuance, which often occurs in the first quarter of a year, or slow-downs in trading activity, particularly during the customary holiday periods in August and December. Our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, technology and communication expenses, professional and consulting fees, occupancy, marketing and advertising, clearing costs and other general and administrative expenses.\nIndustry Background\nFixed-income securities are issued by corporations, governments and other entities, and pay a pre-set absolute or relative rate of return. As of September 30, 2020, the most recent date available, there were approximately $50.1 trillion principal amount of fixed-income securities outstanding in the U.S. market, including $10.4 trillion principal amount of U.S. corporate bonds and $20.4 trillion principal amount of U.S. government bonds, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (“SIFMA”). The estimated average daily trading volume of U.S. corporate bonds, as measured by TRACE, was $35.8 billion in 2020. Primary dealer holdings of U.S. corporate bonds (investment-grade and high-yield) as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York were $8.9 billion as of December 31, 2020. This represents less than one day of trading volume as measured by TRACE.\nTraditionally, bond trading has been a manual process, with product and price discovery conducted over the telephone between two or more parties. This traditional process has a number of shortcomings resulting primarily from the lack of a central trading facility for fixed-income securities, which makes it difficult to match buyers and sellers for particular issues. Many market participants also use e-mail and instant messaging for trading these securities. While these electronic communication methods have addressed some of the limitations associated with telephonic trading, these methods are still hindered by limited liquidity, limited price transparency, significant transaction costs, compliance and regulatory challenges, and difficulty in executing numerous trades at one time. Our platforms’ functionality address many of the remaining shortcomings that result from trading bonds over the telephone, e-mail or instant message.\nDemand for our trading platforms has grown as the need for greater execution efficiency and changing regulations have continued to shift trading from voice markets to electronic markets across our product areas. We and other trading platforms have responded to this demand with technological advances which have further automated many of the manual processes required by traditional methods of trading. Although our market share has increased significantly in recent years, large components of the fixed income markets in which we operate have not yet migrated to electronic trading because of the diverse and heterogeneous nature of those instruments and because participants in these markets have traditionally operated in a more relationship-driven environment.\n4\nRegulatory changes have also driven demand for the electronification of fixed-income trading processes. The policy objectives of a number of post-2008 crisis reforms, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Customer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), Basel III and MiFID II, are to increase transparency and reduce systemic risk. These objectives have generally led to increased adoption of electronic trading on regulated markets where price transparency, all-to-all trading and reporting tools are essential components. The Volcker Rule, which limits proprietary trading by banks, has also had an impact on dealer inventories and the ability of dealers to act as\nmarket-makers. Our Open Trading protocols, which are designed to allow our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients to interact\nin\nan all-to-all trading environment, have helped market participants improve their liquidity and turnover in response to these trends. During 2020,\nover 1,200\nparticipating client firms provided liquidity via our Open Trading solutions and we completed approximately\n1.9\nmillion Open Trading trades, an increase of\n42.7\n%\ncompared to 2019.\nOur Competitive Strengths\nWe believe that we are well positioned to strengthen our market position in electronic trading in our existing products and to extend our presence into new products and services by capitalizing on our competitive strengths, including:\nSignificant Trading Volumes with Participation by Leading Broker-Dealers and Institutional Investors\nOur electronic trading platforms provide access to the liquidity generated by the participation of over 1,800 active institutional investor and broker-dealer clients, including substantially all of the leading broker-dealers in global fixed-income trading. We believe these broker-dealers represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity for U.S. high-grade corporate bonds, emerging markets and high-yield bonds, European high-grade corporate bonds and the other markets in which we operate. Our broker-dealer clients are motivated to continue to utilize our platforms due to the presence on the platforms of our large network of institutional investor clients and their ability to use our Open Trading protocols to help manage their risk, source liquidity, and facilitate transactions on behalf of their clients.\nAs shown in the chart below, our total credit trading volume increased from approximately $1.4 trillion in 2016 to $2.6 trillion in 2020.\n5\nOur estimated share of U.S. high-grade and high-yield corporate bond volume from 2016 to 2020 is shown in the chart below:\nOpen Trading is a Differentiator that Expands the Liquidity Pool and Further Increases Cost-Savings for Clients\nIn the post-financial crisis years, liquidity has remained a persistent concern for market participants as regulators raised banks’ capital requirements and adopted other measures that prompted many dealers to reduce market-making activities even as the buy side’s bond holdings have grown rapidly. In this environment, Open Trading, our fully electronic, all-to-all trading environment, has emerged as one solution to the post-crisis liquidity problem. As a result, the liquidity options for Open Trading participants are broader and more diverse compared to the traditional model of bilateral trading with a limited set of dealer counterparties. The expanded pool of liquidity providers includes investment managers, global dealers, regional dealers and specialist market-making and proprietary trading firms. During 2020, over 1,200 unique liquidity providers participated in Open Trading, which improved the ability of both dealers and institutional investors to find natural and opportunistic matches, move orders more efficiently, and achieve significant increases in execution quality and price improvement.\nWe believe our Open Trading protocols enhance our institutional investor clients’ ability to obtain a competitive price by allowing all of our Open Trading participants to interact with each other, thereby increasing the potential sources of liquidity for each participant, as well as the likelihood of receiving a competitive price response. We estimate that liquidity takers saved an estimated $673.7 million in transaction costs through Open Trading during 2020, while liquidity providers saved an estimated $398.8 million during the year. These Open Trading cost savings are in addition to the potential cost savings institutional investors can achieve by simultaneously requesting bids or offers from our broker-dealer clients via our traditional RFQ protocol. Estimated liquidity taker cost savings is defined as the difference between the winning price and the best disclosed dealer cover price. Estimated liquidity provider cost savings is defined as the difference between the winning price and then current Composite+ bid or offer level (offer if the provider if buying, bid if provider is selling) at the time of the inquiry.\n6\nGrowing, Comprehensive International Offering and Client Base\nOur platforms provide global fixed-income market participants with trading functionality across global hard currency and local currency markets, connecting clients in over 50 countries to local and global dealers. MarketAxess has over 850 active client firms located outside the U.S. that access our platforms through our regulated venues in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Our Open Trading functionality allows international clients to access cross-border liquidity with minimal ramp-up time or regulatory hurdles.\nThe MarketAxess emerging markets trading platform also offers the most comprehensive offering for local currency bond trading across the Latin America, Central & Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (“CEEMEA”), and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) regions. Our platforms provide clients with the ability to trade local currency debt denominated in 27 local currencies with over 125 emerging market dealers.\nRobust, Scalable Technology Throughout the Full Trading Cycle\nWe have developed proprietary technology that is highly secure, fault-tolerant and provides adequate capacity for our current operations, as well as for substantial growth. Our highly scalable systems are designed to accommodate additional volume, products and clients with relatively little modification and low incremental costs. We have consistently used our proprietary technology to find new ways for our clients to trade more effectively and efficiently. Our core software solutions span multiple components of the trading lifecycle and include pre-trade data and analytics, trade execution and post-trade data, analytics and reporting, connectivity and straight-through processing. Our systems are built to be scalable, flexible and resilient. We have also created new trading protocols and developed additional solutions for our clients that are translated and built by our highly experienced technology and business personnel. Going forward, we expect that our agile software development processes will help us continue to be a market leader in developing the technology solutions for our clients’ trading needs.\nIn addition to services directly related to the execution of trades, we offer our clients several other services throughout the trading cycle. In the pre-trade period, our platforms assist our participants by providing them with value-added services, such as real-time and historical trade price information, liquidity and turnover analytics, bond reference data and trade order matching alerts. Following the execution of a trade, our platforms support all of the essential tools and functionalities to enable our participants to realize the full benefits of electronic trading and demonstrate best execution, including real-time trade details, straight-through processing (“STP”), account allocations, automated audit trails, regulatory trade reporting, trade detail matching, and transaction cost analysis.\nNext Generation Data and Analytical Tools Supporting the Increasing Automation of Trading Workflows\nOur data and analytical tools enhance the value proposition of our trading platforms and improve the trading experience of our clients. We support our clients’ trading functions by offering value-added analytics that rely on machine-learning, automation and algorithms that are designed to improve the trading decisions and workflows of our clients. Our data and analytical tools are designed to help clients make better trading decisions, benefitting our current clients and attracting new market participants to our network. For example, our Composite+ pricing algorithm powers many of our automated trading solutions, which allows traders to automatically execute trades according to pre-determined parameters and automatically send completed or rejected order details to internal order management systems. By allowing traders to automate and execute their smaller, low touch trades more efficiently, our auto-execution solutions allow traders to focus their attention on higher value-added trades, with a goal of reducing trading inefficiencies and human errors.\nProven Innovator with an Experienced Management Team\nSince our inception, we have been an innovator in the fixed-income securities markets. The members of our management team average more than 20 years of experience in the securities industry. We have consistently sought to benefit participants in the markets we serve by attempting to replicate the essential features of fixed-income trading, including the existing relationships between broker-dealers and their institutional investor clients, while applying technology to eliminate weaknesses in traditional trading methods and improve liquidity. In recent years, MarketAxess has received industry recognition from key independent publications for its innovations and contributions to the fixed-income market. For example, in 2020, MarketAxess won the Waters Technology “Sell-Side Technology Award” for the Best Sell-Side Trading Network and the Global Capital “Bond Award” for the Best Emerging Markets Bond Trading Platform. In addition, Composite+ won the Waters Technology “Buy-Side Technology Award” for the Best Buy-Side AI Tool. Several awards have recognized our successful use of the agile software development methodology in the development of our Live Markets order book, while a number of our female employees have been honored with leadership awards across the globe.\n7\nIndependen\nt Ownership Structure\nWe believe our ownership structure has been an advantage relative to certain of our competitors that are owned by exchange or dealer groups as we have been free to make balanced business and trading protocol decisions with the best interests of both our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients in mind. We are also able to attract industry leaders with valuable skills and insights to our independent Board of Directors.\nOur Strategy\nOur objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platforms for fixed-income securities, connecting broker-dealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently, while offering a broad array of information, trading and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle. The key elements of our strategy are:\nBroaden Our Client Base in Our Existing Markets and Increase Penetration with Existing Clients\nWe intend to use our broad network of over 1,800 active institutional investor and broker-dealer participants to drive more clients to our leading electronic fixed-income trading platforms. The number of active participants on our platforms has increased by approximately 80% since 2016. We believe that the continued expansion of our client base will lead to even further increases in the liquidity available on our platforms. We expect that the increased liquidity on our platforms and our ability to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product offerings will also help us deepen our market share with our existing clients across our product suite. The number of clients trading three or more products on our platforms has increased by 38.7% from 718 in 2016 to 996 in 2020. Last, we plan to increase our international presence by increasing the number of firms located outside the U.S. that access our platforms through our venues in Europe, Asia and Latin America, increasing the number of local currencies available for trading on our platforms; and, subject to regulatory requirements, increasing the number of countries in which we can offer our platforms.\nEnhance the Liquidity of Securities Traded on Our Platforms by Leveraging our Client Network and Open Trading Protocols\nWe aim to increase the secondary market liquidity on our trading platforms by deploying innovative technology solutions designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties on our platforms and to address different trade sizes, bond liquidity characteristics and trading preferences. Our Open Trading protocols exponentially increase the potential trading counterparties by allowing broker-dealers and institutional investors to interact in an all-to-all trading environment. During 2020, our clients executed approximately 1.9 million trades using our Open Trading solutions, representing 32.7% of the total credit trading volume on our corporate bond platform. In recent years, we have also significantly increased the number of participants that provide bond prices to our corporate bond platform via an algorithm, which has helped increase the number of algorithmic price responses from 0.9 million in 2016 to 14.2 million in 2020. We intend to continue to improve the liquidity of bonds on our platforms by increasing the number of connections we have with algorithmic trading firms. We also believe that the combination of Open Trading and our vast client network provides the basis for MarketAxess to deliver meaningful cross-border liquidity or enter into new markets where liquidity is scarcer, such as municipal bonds.\nContinue to Develop Innovative Next-Generation Technologies that will Allow Our Clients to Further Automate and Improve the Performance of their Trading Desks\nWe believe that the increased adoption of next-generation trading technologies by both dealer and investor clients will create improved liquidity, enhanced trading efficiencies and the ability to identify trends within the bond market. In recent years, we have launched a number of innovative technologies that rely on machine-learning, automation and algorithms that are designed to improve the trading decisions and workflows of our clients, while reducing trading inefficiencies and human errors. For example, clients can use our rules-based auto-execution technology with both our traditional RFQ protocol and Open Trading to automatically execute trades meeting defined parameters with diverse sources of liquidity. Our Composite+ pricing algorithm uses machine-learning to generate near real-time prices for approximately 30,000 corporate and sovereign bonds based on a variety of data inputs, and our Like Bonds product uses a data-driven methodology to help clients find liquid, tradable alternatives to illiquid bonds. We intend to continue to invest in and develop advanced technologies such as these that will make MarketAxess an increasingly valuable part of our clients’ trading decisions and workflows.\n8\nExpand and Strengthen our Trade-Related Service, Data and Analytical Offerings Throughout the Trading Cycle\nWe plan to expand and strengthen our existing service, data and analytical offerings throughout the trading cycle so that MarketAxess is more fully integrated into the workflow of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients. In the pre-trade period, we intend to continue to enhance the value of our information and analytical offerings, including the content and capabilities of BondTicker\n®\n, Axess All\n®\nand Composite+. We plan to enhance and expand the usage of LiquidityBridge\n®\n, our execution management system (“EMS”) service for dealers that allows users to manage and facilitate complex liquidity flows across multiple trading platforms, and Axess IQ\nTM\n, our order and execution workflow solution for the wealth management and private banking community. We also intend to augment our European post-trade matching and regulatory reporting services that enable our clients to comply with their heightened obligations pursuant to MiFID II.\nThe recent acquisition of\nDeutsche Börse’s regulatory reporting business\nis expected to help us expand and improve our services across a broader European client base, predominantly in Germany, France and the Nordics regions.\nAs the use of our pre- and post-trade services and products grow, we believe that MarketAxess will become further entrenched as a value-added resource to our clients at each stage of the trading cycle, which we believe will further increase the attractiveness and use of our trading platforms.\nPursue Select Acquisitions and Strategic Alliances\nWe continually evaluate opportunities to supplement our internal growth by entering into strategic alliances, or acquiring businesses or technologies, that will enable us to enter new markets, provide new products or services, or otherwise enhance the value of our platforms and existing trade-related services to our clients. In 2017, we expanded our strategic alliance with BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock”) to combine BlackRock’s order flow with our Open Trading solution to improve the range of trading connections available to global credit market participants. The acquisition of LiquidityEdge® LLC (“LiquidityEdge”) in 2019 provided our clients with access to one of the leading platforms for U.S. Treasury trading, and it supports the further expansion of our U.S. Treasury hedging capabilities for our corporate bond platform. In 2020, we acquired the regulatory reporting business of Deutsche Börse in order to bolster our post-trade and market data services in Europe and entered into an agreement to acquire MuniBrokers, a central electronic venue serving municipal bond inter-dealer brokers and dealers, in order to expand our existing municipal bond trading solution for global institutional investor and dealer clients.\nOur Key Trading Markets and Services\nU.S. High-Grade Corporate Bond Market\nThe U.S. corporate bond market consists of three broad categories of securities: investment-grade debt (so-called “high-grade”), which typically refers to debt rated BBB- or better by Standard & Poor’s or Baa3 or better by Moody’s Investor Service; debt rated below investment-grade (so-called “high-yield”), which typically refers to debt rated lower than BBB- by Standard & Poor’s or Baa3 by Moody’s Investor Service; and debt convertible into equity (so-called “convertible debt”). According to SIFMA, U.S. corporate bond debt outstanding has increased approximately 26% from $8.3 trillion at year-end 2015 to $10.4 trillion at September 30, 2020. We use the terms high-grade and investment-grade interchangeably in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe U.S. high-grade corporate bond market represents the largest subset of the U.S. corporate bond market. Over the last five years, high-grade corporate bond issuance was over $1 trillion each year. The total annual amount of U.S. high-grade corporate bond issuance as reported by SIFMA increased by 60% to $1.8 trillion in 2020 from $1.1 trillion in 2019. Notwithstanding the growth in the total amount of debt outstanding and new issuance, turnover (which is the total amount traded as a percentage of the amount outstanding for the bonds that traded) is still below pre-credit crisis levels. The average daily trading volume of U.S. high-grade corporate bonds as reported by TRACE for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $25.3 billion compared to $22.2 billion and $20.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOur U.S. high-grade corporate bond business consists of U.S. dollar-denominated investment-grade debt issued by corporations for distribution in the U.S. Over 100 broker-dealers utilize our platforms to trade U.S. high-grade corporate bonds, including all of the top 20 broker-dealers as ranked by underwriting volume of newly-issued U.S. high-grade corporate bonds in 2020. Our broker-dealer clients accounted for approximately 98.5% of the underwriting of newly-issued U.S. high-grade corporate bonds in 2020. More than 1,200 active domestic and foreign institutional investor firms use our platforms to trade U.S. high-grade corporate bonds. Our 2020 trading volume in the U.S. high-grade corporate bond market was $1.4 trillion.\nU.S. Crossover and High-Yield Bond Market\nWe define the high-yield bond market generally to include all debt rated lower than BBB- by Standard & Poor’s or Baa3 by Moody’s Investor Service. We define the crossover market to include any debt issue rated below investment-grade by one agency but investment-grade by the other\n.\nThe total annual amount of high-yield corporate bond issuance as reported by SIFMA increased by 62.7% to $444.9 billion in 2020 from $273.5 billion in 2019. The average daily trading volume of high-yield bonds as measured by TRACE for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $10.5 billion compared to $8.8 billion and $8.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n9\nOver 100 of\nour broker-dealer clients and\nmore than 1,000 active institutional investor firms use our platform\ns\nto trade crossover and high-yield bonds. Trading in crossover and high-yield bonds uses many of the same features available in our U.S. high-grade corporate bond offering. We also offer leveraged loan trading for our clients that trade high-yield bonds. Our\n2020\ntrading volume in the high-yield bond market was $\n384.8\nbillion.\nEmerging Markets Bond Market\nWe define the emerging markets bond market generally to include U.S. dollar, Euro or local currency denominated bonds issued by sovereign entities or corporations domiciled in a developing country. These issuers are typically located in Latin America, Asia, or Central and Eastern Europe. Examples of countries we classify as emerging markets include: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Turkey and Venezuela.\nThe institutional investor base for emerging markets bonds includes many crossover investors from the high-yield and high-grade investment areas. Institutional investors have been drawn to emerging markets bonds by their high returns and high growth potential. The average daily trading volume of emerging markets debt, as reported by the Emerging Markets Trade Association for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the most recent date available, was $17.7 billion compared to $21.3 billion and $19.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOver 125 of our broker-dealer clients and more than 1,200 active institutional investor firms use our platforms to trade emerging markets bonds. The emerging markets countries whose bonds were most frequently traded on our platforms in 2020 were Mexico, Brazil, China and Indonesia. In 2020, our clients were able to trade corporate and sovereign debt denominated in 27 local market currencies on our platform. Our 2020 trading volume in the emerging market bond market was $561.8 billion.\nEuropean Corporate Bond Market\nThe European corporate bond market consists of a broad range of products, issuers and currencies. We define the European corporate bond market generally to consist of bonds intended to be distributed to European investors, primarily bonds issued by European corporations, excluding bonds that are issued by corporations domiciled in an emerging markets country and excluding most government bonds that trade in Europe. Examples include:\nWe believe that the European corporate bond market is impacted by many of the same factors as the U.S. high-grade corporate bond market. The total amount of Euro denominated high-grade and high-yield bonds yearly issuance as reported by the International Capital Markets Association increased 9.7% to $564.3 billion in 2020 from $514.4 billion in 2019. The estimated average daily trading volume of European corporate bonds for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $10.8 billion compared to $10.5 billion and $9.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe offer secondary trading functionality in U.S. dollar- and Euro-denominated European corporate bonds to our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients. We also offer our clients the ability to trade in other European corporate bonds, including bonds issued in British Pounds Sterling, floating rate notes, European government bonds and bonds denominated in non-core currencies. We offered the first platform in Europe with a multi-dealer disclosed counterparty trading capability for corporate bonds.\nIn the Eurobond credit market, defined as including European high-grade, high-yield and government bonds, over 50 broker-dealers utilize our platform, including each of the top 20 broker-dealers as ranked by 2020 European corporate new-issue underwriting volume. Approximately 650 active institutional investor firms use our platforms to trade European bonds. Our 2020 trading volume in the Eurobond bond market was $299.9 billion.\nU.S. Treasury Market\nU.S. Treasury securities are government instruments issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The average daily trading volume of U.S. Treasuries as measured by SIFMA was $607.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $593.6 billion and $547.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n10\nWe entered the U.S. Treasury market in 2019 through our acquisition of\nLiquidityEdge\n.\nLiquidityEdge’s\ncustom liquidity pools, as well as direct dealer streaming capabilities, for on- and off-the-run U.S. Treasuries offer a bespoke trading ecosystem to connect a community of dealers, market-makers and institutional investors\n.\nIn addition to providing MarketAxess clients with an enhanced ability to trade U.S. Treasuries, the acquisition\nsupported the\nexpansion of\nour\ntreasury hedging services for clients desiring to hedge duration risk of certain credit trades\n.\nOver 75 firms use our LiquidityEdge platform to trade U.S. Treasuries. The Treasury products traded on the LiquidityEdge platform include On the Runs, Off the Runs and guaranteed spreads. Our 2020 trading volume in the U.S. Treasury market was $3.9 trillion.\nU.S. Municipal Bond Market\nMunicipal bonds are debt securities issued by states, cities, counties and other governmental entities in the U.S. to fund day-to-day obligations and to finance a wide variety of public projects, such as highways or water systems. Depending on the type of financing, payments of the principal and interest on a municipal bond may come from general revenues of the municipal issuer, specific tax receipts, revenues generated from a public project, payments from private entities or from a combination of sources. In addition to being issued for many different purposes, municipal securities are also issued in many different forms, such as fixed rate, zero coupon or variable rate bonds. The interest paid on municipal securities is typically exempt from federal income taxation and may be exempt from state income and other taxes as well. As of December 31, 2020, there were over 1.0 million different municipal bonds outstanding, in the total aggregate principal amount of more than $3.9 trillion. The average daily trading volume of municipal bonds, excluding variable rate demand notes, as measured by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) was $5.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $5.3 billion and $6.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOver 75 broker-dealer clients and over 300 institutional investor clients use our platforms to trade municipal bonds. We offer trading for both taxable and non-taxable municipal bonds. Our 2020 trading volume in the U.S. municipal bond market was $14.0 billion.\nU.S. Agency Bond Market\nWe define the U.S. agency bond market to include debt issued by a U.S. government-sponsored enterprise. Some prominent issuers of agency bonds are the Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. The total amount of U.S. agency bonds outstanding was approximately $1.8 trillion as of September 30, 2020 as reported by SIFMA. The average daily trading volume of U.S. agency bonds (excluding mortgage-backed securities) as measured by TRACE was $5.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $4.3 billion and $3.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOver 35 of our broker-dealer clients and more than 300 active institutional investor firms use our platforms to trade U.S. agency bonds. Trading in U.S. agency bonds uses many of the same features available in our U.S. high-grade corporate bond offering. Our 2020 trading volume in the U.S. agency bond market was $49.4 billion.\nCredit Derivative Market\nCredit derivatives are contracts that allow market participants to obtain credit protection or assume credit exposure associated with a broad range of issuers of fixed-income securities and other debt obligations without ownership of the underlying security. Among the most significant requirements of the derivatives section of the Dodd-Frank Act are mandatory clearing of certain derivatives transactions (“swaps”) through regulated central clearing organizations and mandatory trading of those swaps through either regulated exchanges or swap execution facilities (“SEFs”), in each case, subject to certain key exceptions. We operate a SEF pursuant to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (“CFTC”) rules and we list certain credit derivatives for trading by U.S. persons and other participants on our SEF.\nWe offer a range of functionality for electronic trading of CFTC-regulated credit derivative instruments on our SEF in compliance with the CFTC’s requirements. This includes an RFQ system that allows participants to send anonymous or disclosed RFQs, as well as an order book, which enables market participants to trade anonymously with all other market participants. Approximately 30 active market participants use our SEF to trade credit derivative indices. Our 2020 credit derivatives trading volume was $45.1 billion.\n11\nExecution Benefits\nfor\nClients\nIn addition to our platforms’ strengths described above, we believe our platforms provide numerous additional benefits to our clients over both traditional fixed-income trading methods and competing electronic trading systems, including:\nOpen Trading Functionality\nWe offer Open Trading protocols for all of our key trading products, including corporate, municipal and emerging market bonds. Our Market List functionality provides our Open Trading participants with the ability to display requests for bids and offers anonymously to the entire MarketAxess trading community, thereby creating broad visibility of their inquiry among market participants and increasing the likelihood that the request results in a completed trade. Public Axes™ is an order book-style price discovery process that gives clients the ability to view anonymous or disclosed indications of interest from the inventory on our platform. For block-sized trades, clients may use our Private Axes\n®\nfunctionality, a protocol that allows participants to anonymously negotiate round lots (greater than $1.0 million) and block trades to minimize information leakage. In 2019, we launched Live Markets, an order book that creates a single view of two-way, actionable prices for the most active corporate bonds, including newly issued debt, benchmark issues and news-driven securities.\nTransparent Pricing on a Broad Range of Securities\nThe price discovery process includes the ability to view indicative prices from our broker-dealer clients’ inventory available on our platform, access to real-time pricing information and analytical tools available on our BondTicker® service (including Composite+ predictive pricing, spread-to-Treasury data, search capabilities and independent third-party credit research), and the ability to request executable bids and offers simultaneously from all of our participating broker-dealer clients during the trading process on any debt security in our bond reference database. Institutional investors and broker-dealer clients can search bonds in inventory based on combinations of issuer, issue, rating, maturity, spread-to-Treasury, size and dealer providing the listing, in a fraction of the time it takes to do so manually. We believe that broad participation in client inquiries results in more trade matches and lower transaction costs.\nHighly Automated Trading Processes that Create Greater Trading Accuracy and Cost-Efficiency\nWe believe that we provide improved efficiency by reducing the time and labor required to conduct broad product and price discovery. Single-security, multi-security (bid or offer lists) inquiries and portfolio trading (baskets of up to 1,500 securities) can be efficiently conducted with multiple broker-dealers or via Open Trading. Our auto-execution technology uses rules-based execution logic to reduce trading inefficiencies and human errors while allowing traders to focus on higher-value trades. In addition, our BondTicker\n®\nservice eliminates the need for manually-intensive phone calls or e-mail communications to gather, sort and analyze information concerning historical transaction prices.\nOur electronic trading platforms also include verification mechanisms at various stages of the execution process which result in greater accuracy in the processing, confirming and clearing of trades between institutional investor and broker-dealer clients, including real-time trade details, STP, account allocations, automated audit trails and trade detail matching. These verification mechanisms are designed to ensure that our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients are sending accurate trade messages by providing multiple opportunities to verify they are trading the correct bond, at the agreed-upon price and size. Our platforms are designed to assist our institutional investor clients in automating the transmittal of order tickets from the portfolio manager to the trader, and from the trader to back-office personnel. This automation provides more timely execution and a reduction in the likelihood of errors that can result from manual entry of information into different systems.\nEfficient Risk Monitoring and Compliance\nInstitutional investors, broker-dealers and their regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that best execution is achieved for fixed-income trades. Our electronic trading platforms offer both institutional investors and broker-dealers an automated audit trail for each stage in the trading cycle. This enables compliance personnel to review information relating to trades more easily and with greater reliability. Trade information, including all price responses, execution time, trade price and, if applicable, spread-to-Treasury, is stored securely and automatically on our electronic trading platform and is provided to clients as part of our automated post-trade messaging. This data represents a valuable source of information for our clients’ compliance personnel. Importantly, we believe the automated audit trail, together with the competitive pricing and transaction cost analysis that is a feature of our electronic trading platforms, gives fiduciaries the ability to demonstrate that they have achieved best execution on behalf of their clients.\n12\nLimited Information Leakage\nOur Open Trading protocols allow our institutional investor clients to maintain their anonymity from trade initiation through to settlement without limiting their number of potential trading counterparties. In addition, our Private Axes\n®\nprotocol allows participants to negotiate bilaterally on an anonymous basis to minimize information leakage when transacting in larger trade sizes.\nGreater Sales Efficiency and More Efficient Inventory Management\nWe offer our broker-dealer clients broad connectivity with our institutional investor clients. Through this connectivity, our broker-dealer clients are able to efficiently display their indications of interest to buy and sell various securities. We also enable broker-dealers to broaden their distribution by participating in transactions to which they otherwise may not have had access. In addition, the ability to post prices and electronically execute on straightforward trades enables bond sales professionals at broker-dealer firms to focus their efforts on higher value-added trades and more complex transactions.\nThe posting of inventory to, and the ability to respond to inquiries from, a broad pool of institutional investors, creates an increased opportunity for broker-dealers to identify demand for their inventory, particularly in less liquid securities. Broker-dealers also use Open Trading as a source of liquidity as they manage their risk exposure. As a result, we believe they can achieve enhanced bond inventory turnover by using our platforms, which may limit their credit exposure.\nPost-Trade Reporting, Publishing and Matching Services\nIn the European Union (“E.U.”) and the U.K., all firms regulated as “investment firms” under MiFID II are required to submit complete and accurate details of qualifying transactions to their national regulator no later than the close of the working day following the date of the transaction. This process is known as transaction reporting. Pursuant to the associated Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (“MiFIR”),\nthe number of fields and the complexity of the information that must be reported to regulators was significantly enhanced. Firms may either report directly to the regulator or use an entity that is licensed as an ARM\n, such as our subsidiaries in the U.K. and the Netherlands, to validate and submit such\nreports. Our multi-asset class ARM reporting solution allows our clients to report to 15 different European regulators. We have also collaborated with Equilend on a full front-to-back Securities Financing Transactions Regulation (“SFTR”) solution to support mutual clients with their SFTR reporting requirements.\nIn addition, under MiFIR, all regulated investment firms in the U.K. and the E.U. are required to comply with pre- and post-trade transparency requirements pursuant to which quotes and trades must be made public subject to a system of waivers and deferrals. Firms are required to utilize an APA, such as our APAs in the U.K. and the Netherlands, to comply with the post trade transparency requirement and, although optional, many firms also utilize a third-party provider to satisfy the pre trade transparency requirement. The MarketAxess transparency and APA trade reporting solutions are available through our Insight™ platform, offering our clients a pre- and post-trade transparency solution, including APA trade reporting, quote publication, SI determination and instrument liquidity classification. We also offer a commodity position reporting service to assist firms in compliance with the commodity derivative position limit reporting requirements of MiFID II.\nTrade matching enables counterparties to agree on the terms of a trade shortly after execution, reducing the risk of trade errors and fails during settlement.\nWe provide a near real-time post-trade matching and exception management tool which covers a broad range of securities, including fixed-income and equities. By confirming all economic details within minutes of trade execution, we help our clients to mitigate their operational risk, improve STP and efficiency and address the complexities of MiFID II and\nthe Central Securities Depositories Regulation\n.\nMarketAxess has approximately 900 post-trade reporting and transparency clients, including broker-dealers, hedge funds and investment banks. We expect that our recent acquisition of Deutsche Börse’s regulatory reporting business will help us expand and improve our services across a broader European client base, predominantly in Germany, France and the Nordics regions.\nInformation and Execution Management Services\nTraders are increasingly using data and machine-learning for pre-trade analytics, automated execution, transaction cost analysis and post-trade solutions. Our real-time pre-trade data and analytics are an additional value-added resource to our participants at each stage of the trading cycle, which further increases the attractiveness and use of our trading platforms. In the pre-trade period, our platforms assist our participants by providing them with real time and historical trade price information, intelligent Composite+ pricing, BondTicker\n®\n, liquidity and turnover analytics, bond reference data and trade order matching alerts. The information and analytical tools we provide to our clients help them make investment and trading decisions. Our electronic trading platforms allow institutional investors to compile, sort and use information to discover investment opportunities that might have been difficult or impossible to identify using a manual information-gathering process or other electronic services.\n13\nOur Composite+ pricing algorithm generates near real-time prices\nfor\napproximately\n30\n,000 corporate\nand sovereign\nbonds\nbased on a variety of data inputs, including feeds from our trading platform, our\npost-trade service and\nTRACE. Composite+ is used by clients as a pre-trade reference price to enhance trading outcomes and transaction cost analysis. Composite+ can be combined with our auto-execution service, providing clients with an alert if a response is “off market”.\nAxess All\n®\n, the first intra-day trade tape for the European fixed-income market, is sourced from over 39,000 bond transactions processed daily by our post-trade services business and includes aggregated volume and pricing for the most actively traded European fixed-income instruments. We also provide market participants with access to pricing, liquidity and volume data on over 60,000 unique fixed-income securities and securities reference data for approximately 71,000 fixed-income securities.\nBondTicker\n®\nprovides real-time TRACE data and enhances it with MarketAxess trade data and analytical tools in order to provide professional market participants with a comprehensive set of corporate bond price information with associated analytical tools that are not otherwise available. The data includes trade time and sales information, including execution prices, as well as MarketAxess-estimated spread-to-Treasuries, for trades disseminated by the TRACE system. The data also includes actual execution prices and spread-to-Treasury levels for U.S. high-grade corporate bond trades executed on the MarketAxess platform. BondTicker\n®\nis currently the source of corporate bond trading information for\nThe Wall Street Journal\nin the U.S\n.\nBondTicker\n®\nallows institutional investors to search for and sort bonds based upon specific criteria, such as volume, time/date of transaction, spread change, issuer or security. This search function allows institutional investors to compile information relating to potential securities trades in a fraction of the time that it takes to manually compile this information from disparate sources or other electronic databases, including direct TRACE feeds and European pricing information provided by our end-of-day pricing feed.\nBondTicker\n®\nis integrated directly into the MarketAxess electronic trading platform and can be seamlessly accessed, either when viewing securities inventory or when launching an inquiry. BondTicker\n®\nis also available through the internet for non-trading professional market participants, including, among others, research analysts and rating agencies, who can log in and access the information via a browser-based interface.\nWe provide order and execution workflow solutions designed to meet the specific needs of the customer. LiquidityBridge\n®\nis our EMS service for dealers that allows users to manage and facilitate the complex liquidity flows across multiple trading platforms, including the MarketAxess system. LiquidityBridge\n®\nbrings together real-time comparison and execution of bond prices across multiple sectors, allowing users to rapidly react to trading opportunities. Axess IQ is our order and execution workflow solution designed to meet the needs of wealth management and private banking community by improving liquidity discovery, execution efficiency and alpha generation for firms with large numbers of individual client orders.\nStraight-Through Processing and APIs\nStraight-through processing refers to the integration of systems and processes to automate the trade process from end-to-end — trade execution, confirmation and settlement — without the need for manual intervention. We provide our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients with a range of tools that facilitate straight-through processing, including order upload, easy-to-use online allocation tools and pre- and post-trade messaging features that enable our clients to communicate electronically between their front- and back-office systems. Our straight-through processing tools can be customized to meet specific needs of our clients and allow them to integrate their order, portfolio management and accounting systems in real time. We maintained over 1,700 STP connections as of December 31, 2020. In addition, many of our clients use our Application Programming Interface (“API”) services for pre-trade, trade negotiation and post-trade services to improve efficiency and reduce errors in processing.\nSales and Marketing\nWe promote our products and services using a variety of direct and indirect sales and marketing strategies. Our sales force, which works closely with our product management and technology teams, is responsible for client acquisition activity and the management of ongoing client relationships to increase clients’ awareness, knowledge and usage of our trading platforms and post-trade solutions, new product launches, information and data services and pre- and post-trade services. Our sales team is also responsible for training and supporting new and existing clients on their use of our platforms and post-trade solutions, including how to optimize their trading performance and efficiency through our various trading protocols. We employ various strategies, including advertising, direct marketing, digital and social media, promotional mailings, and participation in industry conferences and media engagement, to increase awareness of our brand, our trading platforms and our other solutions. For example, we work with\nThe Wall Street Journal\nto leverage BondTicker® data as the source of information for its weekly distressed debt tables.\n14\nCompetition\nThe global fixed-income securities industry generally, and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular, are highly competitive, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. We compete with a broad range of market participants globally. Some of these market participants compete with us in a particular market, while select others compete against the entire spectrum of our platforms and solutions. We face five main areas of competition:\nCompetitors, including companies in which some of our clients have invested, have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic trading platforms that compete or will compete with us. Furthermore, some of our clients have made, and may in the future continue to make, investments in or enter into agreements with other businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us.\nIn general, we compete on the basis of a number of key factors, including:\nWe believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors.\n15\nOur competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our clients with our electronic trading platform\ns\nand other systems. We have focused on the unique aspects of the markets we serve in the development of our platform\ns\n, working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs.\nOur broker-dealer clients have invested in building APIs with us for inventory contributions, electronic trading, government bond benchmark pricing and post-trade messaging. We believe that we have successfully built deep roots with our broker-dealer clients, increasing our level of service to them while at the same time increasing their commitment to use our services; however, the contractual obligations of such clients are non-exclusive. See the Risk Factor captioned “\nWe are dependent on our broker-dealer clients, who are not restricted from using their own proprietary or third-party platforms to transact with our institutional investor clients.\n”\nFurthermore, a significant number of our institutional investor clients have built interfaces to enable them to communicate electronically between our platforms and their order, portfolio management and accounting systems. We believe that this increases the reliance of these institutional investor clients on our services and creates significant competitive barriers to entry.\nTechnology\nThe design and quality of our technology products are critical to our growth and our ability to execute our business strategy. Our electronic trading platforms have been designed with secure, scalable client-server architecture that makes broad use of distributed computing to achieve speed, reliability and fault tolerance. The platforms are built on industry-standard technologies and have been designed to handle many multiples of our current trading volume.\nAll critical server-side components, primarily our networks, application servers and databases, have backup equipment running in the event that the main equipment fails. This offers redundant system capacity designed to maximize uptime and minimize the potential for loss of transaction data in the event of an internal failure. We also seek to minimize the impact of external failures by automatically recovering connections in the event of a communications failure. The majority of our broker-dealer clients and a significant number of our institutional investor clients have redundant dedicated high-speed communication paths to our network in order to provide fast data transfer. Our security measures include industry-standard communications encryption.\nWe have designed our primary application with an easy-to-use, Windows-based interface. Our clients are able to access our electronic trading platforms through a secure, single sign-on. Clients are also able to execute transactions over our platforms directly from their order management systems. We provide users an automatic software update feature that does not require manual intervention.\nWe prioritize security throughout our platforms, operations and software development. We make architectural, design and implementation choices to structurally address security risks, such as logical and physical access controls, perimeter firewall protection and embedded security processes in our systems development lifecycle. Our cybersecurity program is based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework (the “Framework”). The Framework consists of standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity-related risks and promote the protection and resilience of critical infrastructure. Our Global Chief Information Security Officer leads a cybersecurity team in assessing, managing and reducing the relevant risks with a goal to assure critical operations and continuous delivery of service. We constantly monitor connectivity and suspect events are escalated to our global risk and management teams.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely upon a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark laws, written agreements and common law to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. Our software code, elements of our electronic trading platforms, website and other proprietary materials are protected by copyright laws. We have been issued 13 patents covering significant trading protocols and other aspects of our trading system technology.\nThe written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology, processes and intellectual property include agreements designed to protect our trade secrets. Examples of these written agreements include third party nondisclosure agreements, employee nondisclosure and inventions assignment agreements, and agreements with customers, contractors and strategic partners. Other written agreements upon which we rely to protect our proprietary technology, processes and intellectual property take many forms and contain provisions related to patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret rights.\nWe have registered the MarketAxess® name and logo for trademark in the U.S., Europe and in other parts of the world. We also have a number of other registered or pending trademarks and service marks globally, including Open Trading™, BondTicker®, and Now You’re In The Market™, among others. In addition, we own, or have filed applications for, the rights to trade names, copyrights, domain names and service marks that we use in the marketing of products and services to clients.\n16\nIn addition to our efforts to register our intellectual property, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product and service developments, frequent enhancements and reliability with respect to our services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology and market leadership position.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe securities industry and financial markets in the U.S. and elsewhere are subject to extensive regulation. In these jurisdictions, government regulators and self-regulatory organizations oversee the conduct of our business, and have broad powers to promulgate and interpret laws, rules and regulations that may serve to restrict or limit our business. As a matter of public policy, these regulators are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of investors participating in those markets. Our active broker-dealer and regulated venue subsidiaries fall within the scope of their regulations. Rulemaking by regulators, including resulting market structure changes, has had an impact on our business by directly affecting our method of operation and, at times, our profitability.\nAs registered broker-dealers, trading venues and other types of regulated entities as described below, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to laws, rules and regulations (including the rules of self-regulatory organizations) that cover all aspects of their business, including manner of operation, system integrity, anti-money laundering and financial crimes, handling of material non-public information, safeguarding data, capital requirements, reporting, record retention, market access, licensing of employees and the conduct of officers, employees and other associated persons.\nRegulation can impose, and has imposed, obligations on our regulated subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer subsidiaries. These increased obligations require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls, which have increased our costs. Many of our regulators, as well as other governmental authorities, are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative proceedings, examinations, inspections and investigations, which may result in increased compliance costs, penalties, fines, enhanced oversight, increased financial and capital requirements, additional restrictions or limitations, censure, suspension or disqualification of the entity and/or its officers, employees or other associated persons, or other sanctions, such as disgorgement, restitution or the revocation or limitation of regulatory approvals. Whether or not resulting in adverse findings, regulatory proceedings, examinations, inspections and investigations can require substantial expenditures of time and money and can have an adverse impact on a firm’s reputation, client relationships and profitability. From time to time, we and our associated persons have been and are subject to routine reviews, none of which to date have had a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. As a result of such reviews, and any future actions or reviews, we may be required to, among other things, amend certain internal structures and frameworks such as our operating procedures, systems and controls.\nThe regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to constant change. We are unable to predict how certain new laws and proposed rules and regulations will be implemented or in what form, or whether any changes to existing laws, rules and regulations, including the interpretation, implementation or enforcement thereof or a relaxation or amendment thereof, will occur in the future. We believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form of certain new rules and regulations may negatively impact our clients and trading volumes in certain markets in which we transact, although a relaxation of or the amendment of existing rules and requirements could potentially have a positive impact in certain markets. While we generally believe the net impact of the laws, rules and regulations may be positive for our business, it is possible that unintended consequences may materially adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined. See the Risk Factor captioned “\nOur business and the trading businesses of many of our clients are subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation, which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business.\n”\nU.S. Regulation\nIn the U.S., the SEC is the federal governmental agency primarily responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws, including adopting and enforcing rules and regulations applicable to broker-dealers. One of our broker-dealers operates an alternative trading system (“ATS”) subject to the SEC’s Regulation ATS, which includes certain specific requirements and compliance responsibilities in addition to those faced by broker-dealers generally. Another of our broker-dealers operates an exempt ATS for U.S. Treasuries. Broker-dealers are also subject to regulation by state securities administrators in those states in which they conduct business or have registered to do business. We are also subject to the various anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended (the “Securities Act”), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), the Commodity Exchange Act, certain state securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. We also may be subject to vicarious and controlling person liability for the activities of our subsidiaries and our officers, employees and affiliated persons.\n17\nThe CFTC is the federal agency primarily responsible for the administration of federal laws governing activities relating to futures, swaps and other derivatives\n,\nincluding the rules applicable to\nour\nSEF\n. Our SEF is\nsubject to regulations that relate to trading and product requirements, governance and disciplinary requirements, operational capabilities, surveillance obligations and financial information and resource requirements, including the requirement that they maintain sufficient financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year.\nOur\nSEF is\nsubject to both scheduled and unscheduled examinations by\nthe CFTC.\nMuch of the regulation of broker-dealers’ operations in the United States has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations. These self-regulatory organizations adopt rules (which are generally subject to approval by the SEC) that govern the operations of broker-dealers and conduct periodic inspections and examinations of their operations. In the case of our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, the principal self-regulatory organization is FINRA. Our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to both scheduled and unscheduled examinations by the SEC and FINRA. In addition, our broker-dealers’ municipal securities-related activities are subject to the rules of the MSRB.\nTitle VII of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title VII”) amended the Commodity Exchange Act and the Exchange Act to establish a regulatory framework for swaps, subject to regulation by the CFTC, and security-based swaps, subject to regulation by the SEC. The CFTC has implemented the majority of its regulations in this area, most of which are in effect. The SEC has also finalized many of its security-based swap regulations, although a significant number are not yet in effect. Among other things, Title VII rules require certain standardized swaps to be cleared through a central clearinghouse and/or traded on a designated contract market or SEF, subject to various exceptions. Title VII also requires the registration and regulation of certain market participants, including SEFs.\nThe SEC is currently conducting a review of the regulatory framework for fixed income electronic trading platforms for the purpose of evaluating the potential regulatory gaps that may exist among such platforms, including ours, with respect to access to markets, system integrity, surveillance, and transparency, among other things. It is unknown at this time to what extent new legislation will be passed into law or whether pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted or modified, or what effect such passage, adoption or modification will have, whether positive or negative, on our industry, our clients or us.\nNon-U.S. Regulation\nOutside of the United States, we are currently regulated by: the FCA in the U.K., De Nederlandsche Bank (“DNB”) and the AFM in the Netherlands, the Securities & Futures Commission (the “SFC”) of Hong Kong, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (the “MAS”), the Australian Securities and Investment Commission in Australia (the “ASIC”), the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (the “IIROC”) and provincial regulators in Canada, and the Securities and Exchange Commission and Central Bank in Brazil.\nThe FCA’s strategic objective is to ensure that the relevant markets function well and its operational objectives are to protect consumers, to protect and enhance the integrity of the U.K. financial system and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers. It has investigative and enforcement powers derived from the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSMA”) and subsequent legislation and regulations. Subject to the FSMA, individuals or companies that seek to acquire or increase their control in a firm that the FCA regulates is required to obtain prior approval from the FCA.\nThe legal framework in the Netherlands for financial undertakings is predominantly included in the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (“FSA”). The AFM, like DNB, is an autonomous administrative authority with independent responsibility for fulfilling its supervisory function. Pursuant to the FSA, the AFM authorizes investment firms. The AFM is legally responsible for business supervision. DNB is responsible for prudential supervision. The purpose of prudential supervision is to ensure the solidity of financial undertakings and to contribute to the stability of the financial sector. Holders of a qualifying holding (in short, shareholdings or voting rights of 10% or more) must apply to the DNB for a declaration of no objection and satisfy the applicable requirements of the FSA.\nIn January 2018, the E.U. implemented enhanced rules and regulations targeted at the financial services industry, including MiFID II and MiFIR. MiFID II and MiFIR introduced significant changes to the E.U. financial markets that were designed to facilitate more efficient markets and greater transparency for participants by: (i) enhancing pre- and post-trade transparency for fixed-income instruments, (ii) increasing and enhancing post-trade reporting obligations with a requirement to submit post-trade data to ARMs, (iii) improving technology synchronization and best execution and (iv) establishing a consolidated tape for trade data. Although MiFID II and MiFIR were intended to help improve the functioning of the E.U. single market by achieving a greater consistency of regulatory standards,  MiFID II and MiFIR have caused us to expend significantly more compliance, business and technology resources, to incur additional operational costs and  has created additional regulatory exposure for our trading and post-trade businesses. While we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations have been positive for our businesses, unintended consequences of the rules and regulations may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined. In particular, the possible divergence of the U.K. from the E.U. in relation to the future development of MIFID II and MiFIR and other rules and regulations within the financial markets (such as the Central Securities Depository Regulation) may further increase the complexity, operational costs and compliance requirements of our business in the U.K. and E.U.\n18\nThe securities industry\nand financial markets\nin the\n27\nmember states of the E.U. is regulated by agencies in each member state. E.U.\nregulations\nprovide\nfor\na\ncross-border\n“passporting regime”\n, which allows us to\nprovide our services throughout the E.U. in reliance upon\nour authorization from any\nE\n.\nU\n.\nmember state\n.\nHistorically, we have utilized the\nFCA\nauthorizations held by our U.K. regulated subsidiaries in order to provide regulated services to\nour\nEuropean\nclients\noutside of the U.K. in reliance on this passport.\nHowever, the U.K. ceased to be a member of the E.U. on January 31, 2020, triggering a transition period in which the U.K. continued to observe applicable\nE.U.\nregulations through December 31, 2020\n(commonly referred to as “Brexit”).\nIn preparation for Brexit,\nwe\nobtained AFM\nauthorizations\nfor our\nsubsidiaries in the Netherlands\nin 2019 and we are able\nto provide regulated services to\nour\nclients\nwithin the E\n.\nU\n.\nin reliance on the\ncross\n-border services passport\nheld by our Dutch subsidiaries\n.\nSee the Risk Factor captioned “\nThe U.K. exit from the European Union could materially adversely impact our business, clients, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.”\nCapital Requirements\nCertain of our subsidiaries are subject to jurisdictional specific regulatory capital requirements, designed to maintain the general financial integrity and liquidity of a regulated entity. In general, they require that at least a minimum amount of a regulated entity’s assets be kept in relatively liquid form. Failure to maintain required minimum capital may subject a regulated subsidiary to a fine, requirement to cease conducting business, suspension, revocation of registration or expulsion by the applicable regulatory authorities, and ultimately could require the relevant entity’s liquidation.\nIn addition, a\ns a result of our self-clearing activities, MarketAxess Corporation is required to finance certain transactions, maintain deposits with various clearing organizations and clearing broker-dealers and maintain a special reserve bank account for the benefit of customers pursuant to SEC Rule 15c3-3. These requirements can fluctuate based on trading activity, market volatility or other factors which may impact our liquidity or require us to use our capital resources.\nRegulatory Status of MarketAxess Entities\nOur operations span jurisdictions across the Americas, Europe and Asia, and we operate through various regulated entities. The current regulatory status of many of our business entities is described below.

We did not discontinue any compensation or benefits programs in fiscal year 2020. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good and have not experienced any interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements.\nHealth and Safety\nIn fiscal year 2020, the Pandemic had a significant impact on how we manage human capital. Nearly all of our workforce has worked remotely since March 2020, and we instituted safety protocols and procedures for those employees who chose to work on site on a part-time basis. Our experienced teams of employees adapted to the changes in our work environment and have managed our business successfully during this challenging time.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nThe diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives of our employees are one of our biggest strengths. We strive to make our workforce more diverse, inclusive and supportive of all. We embrace a culture and vision that supports and enhances our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent at every level. In 2020, based on the results of an employee survey to further our diversity and inclusion efforts, our employees participated in an educational and developmental program designed to educate our employees about the Company’s diversity and inclusion initiatives and their importance to our success. As of December 31, 2020, our U.S. workforce was approximately 72% men and 28% women, and of our U.S. employees, our workforce was approximately 59% White, 28% Asian, 6% Hispanic or Latinx, 5% Black or African American, and 2% identified with another race or ethnicity.\nTo broaden our candidate pools, we use diverse hiring sources, including employee referrals, recruitment vendors, postings on diversity job boards and with diversity interest groups, and we attend various recruiting events. We have been able to further diversify our workforce through our summer intern and graduate hire programs, which represent a spectrum of schools, fields of study, interests and socio-economic backgrounds. In 2020, we expanded our partnerships with universities with larger racially diverse student bodies in both New York and London, and we specifically targeted affinity groups on campus in order to diversify our applicant pool.\nTalent and Development\nOur talent management strategy is focused on attracting, developing and retaining top talent within the Company. In 2020, we conducted a global talent review to identify high-potential talent at all levels of seniority within the Company. This review is helping us build short- and long-term succession plans for our executive leadership team and other critical roles within the Company.\n20\nThe Company\nalso\nintends to use the talent review process to inform our increasing levels of investment in learning and development for our employees. Currently, we offer a customized management training program for new managers and an accelerated leadership program for our more seasoned leaders who we believe may assume broader or more complex roles within the Company in the future. We also offer a range of technical, markets-related, and soft-skills training courses on an ongoing basis to enable our employees to develop a broad spectrum of skills. We conduct regular engagement surveys of our employee base to better understand what is working well for our employees and identify areas\nthat\nwe can improve.\nIn our latest survey focused on Diversity and Inclusion, 87% of our global employees participated.\nCompany Information\nMarketAxess was incorporated in Delaware in April 2000.

    "text": "Risks Related to Global Economic and Market Conditions\nGlobal economic, political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services, and our profitability and business could suffer.\nThe global financial services business is, by its nature, risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control. Any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the U.S. and/or global financial services markets, resulting in reduced trading volume. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors include:\nThere have been significant declines in trading volumes in the financial markets generally in the past and there may be similar declines in trading volumes generally or across our platforms in particular in the future. Any one or more of the above factors may contribute to reduced trading volumes. Our revenues and profitability are likely to decline significantly during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the U.S. and global financial markets.\nWhile we are expanding our businesses to new geographic areas, our business operations have historically been substantially located in the U.S. and the U.K. Due to the concentration of our operations in the U.S. and U.K. we are subject to greater regional risks than those of some of our competitors.\nOur business has been, and our results of operations and financial condition may be, impacted by the outbreak of, and global response to, the Pandemic and such impact could be materially adverse.\nThe global spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created significant volatility in the markets we serve and has increased uncertainty and economic disruption. The extent to which the Pandemic impacts our business, operations, and financial results is uncertain and will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including:\n22\nIn addition, the increase in our employees working remotely has amplified certain risks related to, among other things, the increased demand on our information technology resources and systems, the increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks as cybercriminals try to exploit the uncertainty surrounding the Pandemic, and the increased number of points of possible attack, such as laptops and mobile devices (both of which are now being used in increased numbers), to be secured. Any failure to effectively manage these increased demands and risks, including to timely identify and appropriately respond to cyberattacks, may adversely affect our business.\nAs a result of the Pandemic, the global economy is currently experiencing a period of significant turmoil and we have experienced significant changes in our daily operations. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Factors Affecting our Industry and our Company—\nEconomic, Political and Market Factors\n.” Due to the uncertainty of the duration, scope and severity of the Pandemic, the uncertainty as to what governmental measures may yet be taken in response to the Pandemic and the unpredictable effect on our business, our employees and our clients, we are not able to reasonably estimate the extent of any potential future impact of the Pandemic on our financial condition or results of operations, but the impact could be material. Even after the Pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience impacts to our business as a result of the Pandemic’s global economic impact. Further, our operating and financial results may be affected in a manner that is not presently known to us or in a manner that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations given the unprecedented and continuously evolving nature of the Pandemic.\nThe U.K. exit from the European Union could materially adversely impact our business, clients, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nBrexit has significantly affected the fiscal, monetary and regulatory landscape in both the U.K. and E.U., and could have a material impact on their economies and the growth of various industries in the future. In particular, the ecosystem of the E.U. financial services industry in which we operate, which prior to Brexit has been heavily centered in London, has become more decentralized. The exit of the U.K. has significantly impacted the business environment in which we and our clients operate, increased the complexity and cost of conducting business in both the E.U. and the U.K., and introduces significant new barriers to cross-border trading, including uncertainties with respect to the legal and regulatory requirements to which we and our clients are subject. We historically conducted business in Europe primarily through the “passporting rights” of our U.K. subsidiaries, which have been eliminated as a result of Brexit. Following Brexit, we now have new regulatory and operational costs and challenges associated with the operation of our regulated subsidiaries in the Netherlands, which we use to provide our trading platforms and certain post-trade services to our clients in the E.U. We could also be adversely affected by having to manage a less centralized customer and employee base.\nBrexit is expected to lead to legal uncertainty and divergence between the U.K. and E.U. financial regulations, which may impact our ability to comply with the extensive government regulation to which we are subject. In addition, the cost and complexity of operating across increasingly divergent regulatory regimes could increase following Brexit. Brexit has also required us to make changes to the technology underlying our trading platforms and regulatory reporting systems in the U.K. and E.U., which has resulted in new regulatory and operational costs and challenges. Changes to U.K. immigration policy will also occur as a result of Brexit and our access to, and our ability to compete for and hire, skilled employees in both the U.K. and the E.U. is expected to become more constrained.\nAlthough it is not possible at this point in time to predict fully the effects of the exit of the U.K. from the E.U., any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Operating in the Electronic Fixed-Income Trading Markets\nDecreases in trading volumes in the fixed-income markets generally or on our platforms would harm our business and profitability.\nWe have experienced significant decreases in overall market volumes in the past and may experience similar decreases in market volumes in the future. Declines in the overall volume of fixed-income securities trading and in market liquidity generally, as well as declines in interest rate volatility, could result in lower revenues from commissions for trades executed on our electronic trading platforms and fees generated from related activities.\n23\nLikewise, decreases in our share of the segments of the fixed-income trading markets in which we operate, or shifts in trading volume to segments of clients which we have not penetrated, could result in lower trading volume on our platform\ns\nand, consequently, lower commissions and revenue. During periods of increased volatility in credit markets, the use of electronic trading platforms by market participants may decrease dramatically as institutional investors may seek to obtain additional information during the trade process through conversations with broker-dealers. In addition, during rapidly moving markets, broker-dealers are less likely to post prices electronically. Our market share of the fixed-income trading markets is also impacted by a variety of other factors, including the amount of new issuances of corporate debt, the level of bond fund inflows or outflows, the percentage of volumes comprised of Rule 144A transactions, the percentage of volumes comprised of larger trades known as\n“\nblock trades\n”\n, the level of credit spreads and credit volatility\nand whether the prevalent market environment is an “offer wanted” or “bid wanted” environment.\nA decline in overall market volumes, trading volumes on our platforms or our platforms’ market share for any reason would negatively affect our commission revenue and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe industry in which we operate is rapidly evolving. If we are unable to adapt our business effectively to keep pace with industry changes, we may not be able to compete effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe electronic financial services industry is characterized by rapidly changing and increasingly complex technologies and systems, changing and increasingly sophisticated client demands (including access to new technologies and markets), frequent technology and service introductions, evolving industry standards, changing regulatory requirements and new business models. If we are not able to keep pace with changing market conditions or client demands and if our competitors release new functionality or technology before we do, our existing platforms, solutions and technologies may become obsolete or our competitive position may be materially harmed, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Operating in a rapidly evolving industry involves a high degree of risk and our future success depends in part on our ability to:\nIf we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks or in executing our business strategy, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nWe face substantial competition that could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.\nThe fixed-income securities industry generally, and the electronic financial services markets in which we operate in particular, are highly competitive, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. Within our markets, we compete based on our ability to provide our clients with deep liquidity, a broad network of market participants, a wide range of products and protocols, and comprehensive pre-trade, trade and post-trade functionality, as well as the reliability, security and ease of use of our electronic platforms and solutions, among other factors. We primarily compete with other electronic trading platforms and trading businesses conducted directly between broker-dealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone, email or instant messaging. Our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include:\n24\nMany of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater market presence, as well as greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources. These competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into, or otherwise compete in, market segments in which we provide services, potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other fixed-income or equity securities or other business operations. In addition, many of our competitors offer a wider range of services, have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do. Some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities, technologies and client requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities.\nCompetition in the markets in which we operate has intensified due to consolidation, which has resulted in increasingly large and sophisticated competitors. In recent years, our competitors have made acquisitions and/or entered into joint ventures and consortia to improve the competitiveness of their electronic trading offerings. If, as a result of industry consolidation, our competitors are able to offer lower cost and/or a wider range of trading venues and solutions, obtain more favorable terms from third-party providers or otherwise take actions that could increase their market share, our competitive position and therefore our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur operations also include the sale of pre- and post-trade services, analytics and market data. There is a high degree of competition among market data and information vendors in solutions for pre- and post-trade data, analytics and reporting, and such businesses may become more competitive in the future as new competitors emerge. Some of these companies are already in or may enter the electronic trading business. Accordingly, some of our competitors may be able to combine use of their electronic trading platforms with complementary access to market data and analytical tools and/or leverage relationships with existing clients to obtain additional business from such clients, which could preempt use of our platforms or solutions. For example, Bloomberg, Refinitiv and ICE own trading platforms that compete with ours and also have a data and analytics relationships with the vast majority of institutional, wholesale and retail market participants. If we are not able to compete successfully in this area in the future, our revenues could be adversely impacted and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Future Levels of Business, Profitability and Growth\nNeither the sustainability of our current level of business nor any future growth can be assured. Even if we do experience growth, we cannot assure you that we will grow profitably.\nThe success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and expand the network of market participants that use our electronic trading platforms. Our business strategy also depends on increasing the use of our platforms by these participants for a wide range of fixed-income products and trade sizes. Individuals at broker-dealers or institutional investors may have conflicting interests, which may discourage their use of our platforms. We cannot assure you that the growth of electronic means of trading securities that we have experienced in recent years will continue.\nOur growth may also be dependent on our ability to diversify our revenue base. We currently derive approximately 48.7% of our revenues from secondary trading in U.S. high-grade corporate bonds. Our long-term business strategy includes expanding our service offerings and increasing our revenues from other fixed-income products and other sources. We cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful or result in increased revenues or continued profitability. We have experienced significant growth in trading volumes, revenues and profitability in recent years. We cannot assure you that our business will continue to grow at a similar rate, if at all.\nWe may enter into new fee plans, the impact of which may be difficult to evaluate; past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions.\nFrom time to time, we may introduce new fee plans for the market segments in which we operate. Any new fee plan may include different fee structures or provide volume incentives. We cannot assure you that any new fee plans will result in an increase in the volume of transactions executed over our platforms or that our revenues will increase as a result of the implementation of any such fee plans. It is possible that our broker-dealer or institutional investor clients could respond to a new fee plan by either reducing the amount of their business conducted on our platforms or terminating their contractual relationship with us, which could have an adverse impact on our fees and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, under certain of our fee plans, our fees are designated in basis points in yield (and, as a result, are subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded) or our fees vary based on trade size or maturity. We anticipate that our average fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield, years-to-maturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platform. Consequently, past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions.\n25\nAs we enter new markets, we may not be able to successfully attract clients and adapt our technology and marketing strategy for use in those markets.\nOur strategy includes leveraging our electronic trading platforms to enter new markets, including new asset classes, products and geographies, including markets where we have little or no operating experience. We may have difficulties identifying and entering into new markets due to established competitors, lack of recognition of our brand and lack of acceptance of our platforms and solutions, as has occurred with certain of our initiatives in the past.\nExpansion, particularly in new geographic markets, may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time. In particular, we may need to make additional investments in management and new personnel, infrastructure and compliance systems. Furthermore, our expansion efforts may divert management’s attention or inefficiently utilize our resources. If we are not able to manage our expansion effectively, our expansion costs could increase at a faster rate than our revenues from these new markets. If we cannot successfully implement the necessary processes to support and manage our expansion, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully adapt our proprietary software and technology for use in any new markets. Even if we do adapt our products, services and technologies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract clients to our platforms and compete successfully in any such new markets. We cannot assure you that our marketing efforts or our pursuit of any of these opportunities will be successful. If these efforts are not successful, we may realize less than expected earnings, which in turn could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock.\nWe may face increasing economic and regulatory challenges in our growing international operations that we may not be able to meet in the future.\nWe operate electronic trading platforms in Europe, Latin America and Asia and we may further expand our operations throughout these and other regions. We have invested significant resources in our foreign operations and the increasing globalization of our platforms and services. However, there are certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets, particularly in the financial services industry, which is heavily regulated in many jurisdictions. These risks include:\nOur international operations are also subject to the legal, economic and market risks associated with geopolitical uncertainties in other regions of the world, including but not limited to the risk of war, inter and intra national conflict, economic crises and terrorism.\nIn addition, we must comply with the laws, regulations and registration rules of foreign governments and regulatory bodies for each country in which we conduct business. For example, MiFID II was implemented by regulatory bodies in Europe in January 2018. We cannot predict the full extent to which any of these new regulations or future regulatory changes may impact our European business and operations, but they may cause us to expend significantly more compliance, business and technology resources, incur additional operational costs and create additional regulatory exposure.\nBrexit could lead to further legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Our compliance with these changing laws and regulations may be costly and time-consuming and may have a material adverse effect on our clients’ trading activities on our platforms. We cannot predict what future actions the regulatory bodies that supervise our business might take, or the impact that any such actions may have on our business.\nFurther, we may face unexpected challenges in our international operations due to global competitors, established local markets, and economic and political instability. Our inability to manage these risks effectively could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our international operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n26\nRisks Related to our Customer Concentration\nWe are dependent on our broker-dealer clients, who are not restricted from using their own proprietary or third-party platforms to transact with our institutional investor clients.\nWe rely on our broker-dealer clients to provide liquidity on our electronic trading platforms by posting prices for bonds in their inventory and responding to institutional investor client inquiries. The contractual obligations of our broker-dealer clients to us are minimal, non-exclusive and terminable by such clients. Our broker-dealer clients buy and sell fixed-income securities through traditional methods, including by telephone and e-mail messaging, and through other electronic trading platforms. Some of our broker-dealer clients have developed electronic trading networks that compete with us or have announced their intention to explore the development of such electronic trading networks, and many of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients are involved in other ventures, including other electronic trading platforms or other distribution channels, as trading participants and/or as investors. These competing trading platforms may offer some features that we do not currently offer. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that such broker-dealers’ primary commitments will not be to one of our competitors.\nIf bank-affiliated entities reduce their trading activity and that activity is not replaced by other market participants, the level of liquidity and pricing available on our trading platform would be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our operating results. In the U.S., the Volcker Rule section of the Dodd-Frank Act bans proprietary trading by banks and their affiliates, which could adversely affect our bank-affiliated broker-dealer clients’ ability to make markets in a variety of fixed-income securities. In addition, over the past several years, there has been significant consolidation among firms in the banking and financial services industries and several of our large broker-dealer clients have reduced their sales and trading businesses in fixed-income products. Further consolidation, instability, and layoffs in the financial services industry could result in a smaller client base and heightened competition, which may lower volumes.\nAny reduction in the use of our electronic trading platforms by our broker-dealer clients could reduce the volume of trading on our platform, which could, in turn, reduce the use of our platforms by our institutional investor clients. The occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could lose significant sources of revenue and trading volume if we lose any of our significant institutional investor clients.\nWe rely on our institutional investor clients to launch inquiries over our trading platforms and, increasingly, to provide liquidity through our Open Trading protocols. A limited number of such clients can account for a significant portion of our trading volume. The obligations of our institutional investor clients to us under our standard contractual agreements are minimal, non-exclusive and terminable by such clients. Our institutional investor clients also buy and sell fixed-income securities through traditional methods, including by telephone, e-mail and instant messaging, and through other electronic trading platforms.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our major institutional investor clients or that such clients will continue to use our trading platform. The loss of a major institutional investor client or any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platforms by such clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCredit and Operational Risks\nWe are exposed to risks in connection with certain transactions in which we act as a matched principal intermediary.\nIn connection with our anonymous trading protocols, we execute certain bond transactions between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades which are then settled by us or through a third-party clearing broker. Settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded.\nWe are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to the clients on our platforms, including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk. In connection with Open Trading or other anonymous protocols, we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase.\n27\nIn the process of executing matched principal transactions, miscommunications and other errors by our clients or us can arise that involve substantial risks of liability. These risks include, among others, potential liability from disputes over the terms of a trade, the settlement of the trade, or claims that we resolved an error trade dispute incorrectly or that a system malfunction or delay caused monetary loss to a client. In addition, because of the ease and speed with which trades can be executed on our electronic platform\ns\n, clients can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade instructions or by entering trade orders inaccurately. A significant error trade or a large number of error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade on our platform\ns\n. Although we maintain error trade policies designed to protect our\nanonymous trading\nparticipants and enable us to manage the risks attendant in acting as a matched principal counterparty, depending on the cause, number and value of the trades that are the subject of an alleged error or dispute, such trades have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we are required to hold a securities position as a result of an error, there may also be financing costs or regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us.\nWe have policies, procedures and automated controls in place to identify and manage our credit risk, though there can be no assurance that they will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure. Some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixed-income markets, our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources. Such information may not be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly assessed and interpreted by us. If our risk management procedures fail, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks.\nSelf-clearing exposes us to significant operational, liquidity, financing and regulatory risks.\nWe began self-clearing substantially all of our bond transactions for our U.S. operations in the third quarter of 2020 and we may expand self-clearing to our foreign operations in the future. Self-clearing requires us to finance transactions and maintain margin deposits at clearing organizations. Self-clearing exposes our business to operational risks, including business and technology disruption; operational inefficiencies; liquidity, financing and regulatory risks; and potentially increased expenses. In connection with our conversion to self-clearing for our U.S. operations in 2020, we experienced operational inefficiencies and technology issues which, in combination with the capital and liquidity requirements that are imposed on all new self-clearing members, resulted in increased fail rates in the immediate period following the conversion. Although the initial conversion issues for our U.S. clearing operations have been resolved, in the future, we may encounter difficulties with self-clearing that lead to operating inefficiencies, technology issues, dissatisfaction amongst our client base, disruption in the infrastructure that supports the business, inadequate liquidity, increased margin requirements with clearing organizations and third-party settlement agents who provide financing with respect to transactions, reductions in available borrowing capacity and financial loss. Any such delay, disruption, expense or failure could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk. Moreover, any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial\ncondition and operating results.\nTechnology, IT Systems and Cybersecurity Risks\nRapid market or technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our products and services to our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients.\nWe must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platforms. The electronic financial services industry is characterized by significant structural changes, increasingly complex systems and infrastructures, changes in clients’ needs and preferences and new business models. If new industry standards and practices emerge and our competitors release new technology before us, our existing technology, systems and electronic trading platforms may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed. Our future success will depend on our ability to:\nDeveloping our electronic trading platforms and other technology entails significant technical and business risks. We may use new technologies ineffectively or we may fail to adapt our electronic trading platforms, information databases and network infrastructure to broker-dealer or institutional investor client requirements or emerging industry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new services, products and enhancements, our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients may forego the use of our platforms and use those of our competitors.\n28\nFurther, the adoption of new internet, networking,\ncloud,\ntelecommunications or blockchain technologies may require us to devote substantial resources to modify and adapt our services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology and transaction-processing systems to client requirements or emerging industry standards. We cannot assure you that we will be able to respond in a timely manner to changing market conditions or client requirements.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers for key products and services.\nWe rely on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading, information and other systems, as well as computers and other equipment, and related support and maintenance. We cannot assure you that any of these providers will be willing and able to continue to provide these services in an efficient, cost-effective manner, if at all, or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs. If we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of critical products or services in the event of a malfunction of a product or an interruption in or the cessation of service by an existing service provider, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIn particular, we depend on third-party vendors for our bond reference databases, the clearing and settlement of our Open Trading transactions and to provide the technology underpinning our U.S. Treasury platform. We obtain essential reference data and information services from external sources, including data received from certain competitors, clients, self-regulatory organizations and other third-party data providers. Our reference data sources and information providers could increase the price for or withdraw their data or information services for a variety of reasons. Further, as has occurred in the past, our competitors could revise the current terms on which they provide us with data or information services or could cease providing us with data or information services altogether for a variety of reasons, including competition. Disruptions in the services provided by those third-parties to us, including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue to license products or provide technology services that are critical to the success of our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also rely, and expect in the future to continue to rely, on third parties for various computer and communications systems, such as telephone companies, online service providers, data processors, cloud computing and software and hardware vendors. Other third parties provide, for instance, our data center, telecommunications access lines and significant computer systems and software licensing, support and maintenance services. Any interruption in these or other third-party services or deterioration in their performance could impair the quality of our service. We cannot be certain of the financial viability of all of the third parties on which we rely.\nWe license software from third parties, much of which is integral to our electronic trading platform and our business. We also hire contractors to assist in the development, quality assurance testing and maintenance of our electronic trading platform and other systems. Continued access to these licensors and contractors on favorable contract terms or access to alternative software and information technology contractors is important to our operations. Adverse changes in any of these relationships has in the past had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe attempt to negotiate favorable pricing, service, confidentiality and intellectual property ownership or licensing and other terms in our contracts with our third-party service providers. These contracts usually have multi-year terms. However, there is no guarantee that these contracts will not terminate and that we will be able to negotiate successor agreements or agreements with alternate service providers on competitive terms. Further, the existing agreements may bind us for a period of time to terms and technology that become obsolete as our industry and our competitors advance their own operations and use of technology.\nOur success depends on maintaining the integrity and capacity of our electronic trading platforms, systems and infrastructure.\nIn order to be successful, we must provide reliable, secure, real-time access to our electronic trading platforms for our clients. If our trading platforms cannot cope, or expand to cope, with demand, or otherwise fail to perform, we could experience disruptions in service, slow delivery times and insufficient capacity. These consequences could result in our clients deciding to stop using or reduce their use of our platforms, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs our operations grow in both size and scope, we will need to continually improve and upgrade our electronic trading platforms and infrastructure to accommodate potential increases in order message volume and trading volume, the trading practices of new and existing clients, regulatory changes and the development of new and enhanced trading platform features, functionalities and ancillary products and services. The expansion of our electronic trading platforms and infrastructure has required, and will continue to require, substantial financial, operational and technical resources. These resources will typically need to be committed well in advance of any actual increase in trading volumes and order messages. We cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading volumes and order messages will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading volumes and order messages without failure or degradation of performance. Furthermore, we use new technologies to upgrade our established systems, and the development of these new technologies also entails technical, financial and business risks. We cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our existing electronic trading platforms, technology and systems to the requirements of our broker-dealer\n29\nand institutional investor clients or to emerging industry standards. The inability of our electronic trading platform\ns\nto accommodate increasing trading volume and order messages would also constrain our ability to expand our business.\nSystems failures, interruptions, delays in service, catastrophic events and resulting interruptions in the availability of our trading platforms could materially harm our business and reputation.\nOur business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our trading platforms, systems, networks and infrastructure. We cannot assure you that we, or our third-party providers, will not experience systems failures or business interruptions, as has occurred in the past. Our systems, networks, infrastructure and other operations, in particular our trading platforms, are vulnerable to impact or interruption from a wide variety of causes, including: irregular or heavy use of our trading platforms during peak trading times or at times of increased market volatility; power, internet or telecommunications failures; hardware failures or software errors; human error, acts of vandalism or sabotage; catastrophic events, such as natural disasters, extreme weather events or acts of war or terrorism; malicious cyberattacks or cyber incidents, such as unauthorized access, ransomware, loss or destruction of data, computer viruses or other malicious code; and the loss or failure of systems over which we have no control, such as loss of support services from critical third-party providers. In addition, we may also face significant increases in our use of power and data storage and may experience a shortage of capacity and/or increased costs associated with such usage.\nAny failure of, or significant interruption, delay or disruption to, or security breaches affecting, our systems, networks or infrastructure has in the past, and could in the future, result in: disruption to our operations, including disruptions in service to our clients; slower response times; distribution of untimely or inaccurate market data to clients who rely on this data for their trades; delays in trade execution; incomplete or inaccurate accounting, recording or processing of trades; significant expense to repair, replace or remediate systems, networks or infrastructure; financial losses and liabilities to clients; loss of clients; legal or regulatory claims, proceedings, penalties or fines. Any system failure or significant interruption, delay or disruption in our operations, or decreases in the responsiveness of our platforms, could materially harm our reputation and business and lead our clients to decrease or cease their use of our platforms. We internally support and maintain many of our systems and networks, including those underlying our trading platforms; however, we may not have sufficient personnel to properly respond to all systems, networks or infrastructure problems. Our failure to monitor or maintain our systems, networks and infrastructure, including those maintained or supported by our third-party providers, or to find a replacement for defective or obsolete components within our systems, networks and infrastructure in a timely and cost-effective manner when necessary, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we generally have disaster recovery and business continuity plans that utilize industry standards and best practices for much of our business, including redundant systems, networks, computer software and hardware and data centers to address interruption to our normal course of business, our systems, networks and infrastructure may not always be fully redundant and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans may not always be sufficient or effective. Similarly, although some contracts with our third-party providers, such as our hosting facility providers, require adequate disaster recovery or business continuity capabilities, we cannot be certain that these will be adequate or implemented properly. Our disaster recovery and business continuity plans are heavily reliant on the availability of the internet and mobile phone technology, so any disruption of those systems would likely affect our ability to recover promptly from a crisis situation. If we are unable to execute our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, or if our plans prove insufficient for a particular situation or take longer than expected to implement in a crisis situation, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur.\nIf we experience design defects, errors, failures or delays with our platforms, products or services, including our auto-execution technology and pricing algorithms, our business could suffer serious harm.\nOur platforms, products and services, including our auto-execution technology and pricing algorithms, may and have from time to time contained design defects and errors when first introduced or when new updates or enhancements are released. In our development of new protocols, platform features and updates and enhancements to our existing platforms, products and services, including our auto-execution technology and pricing algorithms, we may make a design error that causes the platform, protocol or feature to operate incorrectly or less effectively. Many of our protocols also rely on data and services provided by third-party providers over which we have limited or no control and may be provided to us with defects, errors or failures. Our clients may also use our platforms, products or services together with their own software, data or products from other companies. As a result, when problems occur, it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem.\nIf design defects, errors or failures are discovered in our current or future platforms or protocols, we may not be able to correct or work around them in a cost-effective or timely manner or at all. The existence of design defects, errors, failures or delays that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could also result in rejection or delay in market acceptance of our platforms or protocols, damage to our reputation, loss of clients and related revenues, diversion of resources, product liability claims, regulatory actions or increases in costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n30\nMalicious cyber-attacks and other adverse events affecting our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses or regulatory penalties.\nThe operation of our electronic trading platforms relies on the secure processing, storage and transmission of a large amount of transactional data and other confidential sensitive data (including confidential client and personal information). Our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential and personal customer information), unavailability or disruption of service, computer viruses, acts of vandalism, or other malicious code, cyber-attack and other adverse events that could have an adverse security impact. Despite the defensive measures we have taken, we are, and will continue to be, subject to attacks, which may come from external factors such as governments, organized crime, hackers, and other third parties such as infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom we have granted access to our computer systems. If our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to trading or other confidential or personal information, our reputation could be damaged, our business would suffer and we could incur material liability. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.\nOur business also depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our platforms, systems, networks and infrastructure. Any failure of, or significant interruption, delay or disruption to, our systems, networks or infrastructure due to a cyber-attack could result in: disruption to our operations, including disruptions in service to our clients; slower response times; distribution of untimely or inaccurate market data to clients who rely on this data for their trades; delays in trade execution; incomplete or inaccurate accounting, recording or processing of trades; significant expense to repair, replace or remediate systems, networks or infrastructure; financial losses and liabilities to clients; loss of clients; legal or regulatory claims, proceedings, penalties or fines. We also face the risk of operational disruption, failure or capacity constraints of any of the third-party service providers that facilitate our business activities, including clients, clearing agents and trading system software, network or data providers. Such parties could also be the source of a cyber-attack on or breach of our operational systems, data or infrastructure. Any system failure or significant interruption, delay or disruption in our operations, or decreases in the responsiveness of our platforms, could materially harm our reputation and business and lead our clients to decrease or cease their use of our trading platform.\nThere have been an increasing number of cyber-attacks in recent years in various industries, including ours, and cybersecurity risk management has been the subject of increasing focus by our regulators. Our regulators in recent years have increased their examination and enforcement focus on matters relating to cybersecurity threats, including the assessment of firms’ vulnerability to cyber-attacks. In particular, regulatory concerns have been raised about firms establishing effective cybersecurity governance and risk management policies, practices and procedures; protecting firm networks and information; identifying and addressing risks associated with clients, vendors, and other third parties; preventing and detecting unauthorized activities; adopting effective mitigation and business continuity plans to address the impact of cybersecurity breaches; and establishing protocols for reporting cybersecurity incidents. Any insurance that we may have that covers a specific cybersecurity incident would not protect us from the effects of adverse regulatory actions that may result from the incident or a finding that we had inadequate cybersecurity controls, including the reputational harm that could result from such regulatory actions.\nOur remediation costs and lost revenues could be significant if we fall victim to a cyber-attack. If an actual, threatened or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and could cause our clients to reduce or stop their use of our electronic trading platforms. We may be required to expend significant resources to repair system damage, protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm, loss of clients and revenues and litigation, caused by any breaches. We may be found liable to our clients for any misappropriated confidential or personal information. Although we intend to continue to implement industry-standard security measures, we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient.\nOur actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws, regulations, and obligations could harm our business.\nData privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations in countries where we do business. For example, the E.U. adopted the General Data Protection Regulations (“GDPR”), which as of May 2018 requires entities both in the European Economic Area and outside to comply with new regulations regarding the handling of personal data. Brexit has created additional uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection as the U.K now has its own data protection laws which are separate from the E.U. GDPR. We are also subject to certain U.S. federal and state laws governing the protection of personal data. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number. In addition to the increased cost of compliance, our failure to successfully implement or comply with appropriate processes to adhere to the GDPR and other laws and regulations relating to personal data could result in substantial financial penalties for non-compliance, expose us to litigation risk and\ncould result in significant liability, increased costs or cause our clients to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business\n.\n31\nIntellectual Property Risks\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights or technology effectively, which would allow competitors to duplicate or replicate our electronic trading platforms or any of our other current or future functionalities, products or services. This could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nIntellectual property is critical to our success and ability to compete, and if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology. We rely primarily on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, third-party non-disclosure and other agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. We attempt to negotiate beneficial intellectual property ownership provisions in our contracts and also require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements in order to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information. We have been issued 13 patents covering aspects of our technology and/or business, but can give no assurances that any such patents will protect our business and processes from competition or that any patents applied for in the future will be issued. Additionally, laws and our contractual terms may not be sufficient to protect our technology from use or theft by third parties. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that these protections will be adequate to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology.\nWe may have legal or contractual rights that we could assert against illegal use of our intellectual property rights, but lawsuits claiming infringement or misappropriation are complex and expensive, and the outcome would not be certain. In addition, the laws of some countries in which we now or in the future provide our services may not protect software and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If our efforts to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights are inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates, dilutes or infringes on our intellectual property, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDefending against intellectual property infringement or other claims could be expensive and disruptive to our business. If we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others, we could be required to redesign our technology, pay royalties or enter into license agreements with third parties.\nIn the technology industry, there is frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As the number of participants in our market increases and the number of patents and other intellectual property registrations increases, the possibility of an intellectual property claim against us grows. Although we have never been the subject of a material intellectual property dispute, we cannot assure you that a third party will not assert in the future that our technology or the manner in which we operate our business violates its intellectual property rights. From time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect that third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand the complexity and scope of our business, the number of electronic trading platforms increases and the functionality of these platforms further overlaps. Any claims, whether with or without merit, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend, make it more difficult to operate or prevent us from operating our business, or portions of our business, and result in significant monetary liability.\nWe cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us, as they have done in the past, with respect to our electronic trading platforms or any of our other current or future products or services or that any such assertion will not require us to cease providing such services or products, try to redesign our products or services, enter into royalty arrangements, if available, or engage in litigation that could be costly to us. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Possible Transactions or Investments\nIf we acquire or invest in other businesses, products or technologies, and are unable to integrate them with our business, our financial performance may be impaired or we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions or any strategic alliances, partnerships or joint ventures, which we may enter into.\nFrom time to time, we may pursue acquisitions, which may not be completed or, if completed, may not be as beneficial to us as expected. We have made acquisitions in the past, including the purchases of LiquidityEdge in 2019 and the regulatory reporting business of Deutsche Borse in 2020. We also may consider potential divestitures of businesses from time to time. We routinely evaluate potential acquisition and divestiture candidates and engage in discussions and negotiations regarding potential acquisitions and divestitures on an ongoing basis; however, even if we execute a definitive agreement, there can be no assurance that we will consummate the transaction within the anticipated closing timeframe, or at all. Moreover, there is significant competition for acquisition and expansion opportunities in the electronic financial services industry.\n32\nIf we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business, product or technology, such acquisitions and investments may involve a number of risks, including:\nThese factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time. From time to time, we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated. Such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time, as well as out-of-pocket costs.\nThe consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results. If we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition. To the extent we issue shares of capital stock or other rights to purchase capital stock, including options or other rights, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, large one-time write-offs, such as of acquired in-process research and development costs, and restructuring charges.\nWe may also enter into strategic alliances, partnerships or joint ventures as a means to accelerate our entry into new markets, provide new solutions or enhance our existing capabilities. Entering into strategic alliances, partnerships and joint ventures entails risks, including: (i) difficulties in developing or expanding the business of newly formed alliances, partnerships and joint ventures; (ii) exercising influence over the activities of joint ventures in which we do not have a controlling interest; (iii) potential conflicts with or among our partners; (iv) the possibility that our partners could take action without our approval or prevent us from taking action; and (v) the possibility that our partners become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations.\nRisks Related to Key Personnel and Employees\nWe are dependent on our management team, and the loss of any key member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel, particularly Richard M. McVey, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors. The terms of Mr. McVey’s employment agreement with us do not require him to continue to work for us and allow him to terminate his employment at any time, subject to certain notice requirements and forfeiture of non-vested equity compensation awards. We do not maintain “key person” life insurance on any of our executive officers and other key personnel. Although we have invested in succession plans and we have short-term contingency plans in place, any loss or interruption of Mr. McVey’s services or that of one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel for any reason, as well as any negative market or industry perception arising from such loss or interruption, could result in our inability to manage our operations effectively and/or pursue our business strategy.\n33\nBecause competition for our employees is intense, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our business.\nWe strive to provide high-quality services that will allow us to establish and maintain long-term relationships with our clients. Our ability to provide these services and maintain these relationships, as well as our ability to execute our business plan generally, depends in large part upon our employees. We must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for software engineers with extensive experience in designing and developing software and internet-related services, product managers and senior sales executives.\nThe market for qualified personnel has become increasingly competitive as an increasing number of existing and new competitors focus on the electronic trading of fixed income products. Many of these competitive ventures are interested in hiring our experienced technology personnel and our qualified sales staff. Additionally, highly innovative technology firms may offer attractive employment opportunities to our technology personnel. Many of these firms have greater resources than we have and are able to offer more lucrative compensation packages. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel. The failure to attract new personnel or to retain and motivate our current personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and we may face restrictions with respect to the way we conduct certain of our operations.\nOur business is subject to increasingly extensive governmental and other regulations. These regulations are designed to protect public interests generally rather than the interests of our stockholders. The SEC, FINRA, the CFTC and other agencies extensively regulate the United States financial services industry, including most of our operations in the United States. Much of our international operations are subject to similar regulations in their respective jurisdictions, including regulations overseen by the FCA in the U.K., the AFM in the Netherlands, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority in Switzerland, ASIC in Australia, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada and provincial regulators in Canada, and the Securities and Exchange Commission and Central Bank in Brazil. In addition, our regulatory reporting business is registered as an ARM and APA with the FCA and the AFM.\nAs a matter of public policy, these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and protecting the interests of investors in those markets. These regulatory bodies have broad powers to promulgate and interpret, investigate and sanction non-compliance with their laws, rules and regulations. Most aspects of our broker-dealer and other licensed subsidiaries are highly regulated, including the way we deal with our clients; our capital requirements; our financial and regulatory reporting practices; required record-keeping and record retention procedures; the licensing of our employees; and the conduct of our directors, officers, employees and affiliates.\nWe cannot assure you that we and/or our directors, officers and employees will be able to fully comply with these laws, rules and regulations. If we fail to comply with any of these laws, rules or regulations, we may be subject to censure, fines, cease-and-desist orders, suspension of our business, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of our membership in FINRA and registration as a broker-dealer.\nCertain of our regulated subsidiaries, including our registered broker-dealers and MTF, are subject to U.S. or foreign regulations which prohibit repayment of borrowings from us or our affiliates, paying cash dividends, making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources, without prior notification to or approval from such subsidiary’s principal regulator. MarketAxess SEF Corporation is registered with the CFTC as a SEF and is required, among other things, to maintain sufficient financial resources to cover operating costs for at least one year.\nOur ability to operate our platforms in a jurisdiction is dependent on continued registration or authorization in that jurisdiction or the maintenance of a proper exemption from such registration or authorization. Our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our compliance, credit approval, audit and reporting systems and procedures, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance, credit approval, audit and risk management personnel. Our systems and procedures may not be sufficiently effective to prevent a violation of all applicable rules and regulations. In addition, the growth and expansion of our business may create additional strain on our compliance systems, procedures and personnel and has resulted, and we expect will continue to result, in increased costs to maintain and improve these systems.\nIn addition, because our industry is heavily regulated, regulatory approval may be required in order to continue or expand our business activities and we may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals on a timely or cost-effective basis, or at all. Even if approvals are obtained, they may impose restrictions on our business or we may not be able to continue to comply with the terms of\n34\nthe approvals or applicable regulations. The implementation of unfavorable regulations or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies could require us to incur significant compliance costs or cause the development or continuation of business activities in affected markets to become impractical. For a further description of the regulations which may limit our activities, see “Item 1. Business—Government Regulation.”\nSome of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations regarding changes in control of their ownership. These regulations generally provide that regulatory approval must be obtained in connection with any transaction resulting in a change in control of the subsidiary, which may include changes in control of MarketAxess. As a result of these regulations, our future efforts to sell shares or raise additional capital may be delayed or prohibited in circumstances in which such a transaction would give rise to a change in control as defined by the applicable regulatory body.\nOur business and the trading businesses of many of our clients are subject to increasingly extensive government and other regulation, which may affect our trading volumes and increase our cost of doing business.\nOur business, and the business of many of our clients, is subject to extensive regulation. Governmental and regulatory authorities periodically review legislative and regulatory initiatives, and may promulgate new or revised, or adopt changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing, rules and regulations at any time. The new administration elected in the 2020 U.S. presidential election may enact regulatory changes that may affect our business. Any such changes in laws, rules or regulations or in governmental policies could create additional regulatory exposure for our business, cause us to incur significant additional costs, require us to change or cease aspects of our business or restrict or limit our ability to grow our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. There have been in the past, and could be in the future, significant technological, operational and compliance costs associated with the obligations that derive from compliance with evolving laws, rules and regulations.\nWe cannot predict whether additional changes to the laws, rules and regulations that govern our business and operations, including changes to their interpretation, implementation or enforcement, will occur in the future or the extent to which any such changes will impact our business and operations. For example, the divergence of the U.K. from the E.U. in relation to the future development of MiFID II and other rules and regulations governing the financial markets (such as the Central Securities Depository Regulation) may adversely affect us in ways yet to be determined. In addition, we cannot predict how current proposals that have not yet been finalized and/or that remain subject to ongoing debate will be implemented or in what form. We believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form of such new laws, rules and regulations may negatively impact our clients and trading volumes in certain markets in which we transact. Additionally, unintended consequences of such new laws, rules and regulations may adversely affect our industry, our clients and us in ways yet to be determined. Any such legal and regulatory changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe extensive regulation of our business means we have ongoing exposure to potentially significant costs and penalties.\nOur businesses are subject to regulation by governmental and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. Many of these regulators, including U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., are empowered to bring enforcement actions and to conduct administrative proceedings and examinations, inspections, and investigations, which may result in costs, penalties, fines, enhanced oversight, additional requirements, restrictions, or limitations, and censure, suspension, or expulsion. Self-regulatory organizations such as FINRA and the National Futures Association (“NFA”), along with statutory bodies such as the SEC, the CFTC, and the FCA, and other international regulators, require strict compliance with their rules and regulations.\nFirms in the financial services industry have experienced increased scrutiny in recent years, and penalties, fines and other sanctions sought by regulatory authorities, including the SEC, the CFTC, FINRA, the NFA, state securities commissions and state attorney generals in the U.S., and the FCA in the U.K. and other international regulators, have increased accordingly. Accordingly, we face the risk of regulatory intervention, investigations and proceedings, any of which could involve extensive scrutiny of our activities and result in significant fines and liability. Any of these developments would require significant time and financial resources and could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to the risks of litigation and securities laws liability.\nMany aspects of our business, and the businesses of our clients, involve substantial risks of liability. Dissatisfied clients have in the past, and may in the future, make claims against us regarding quality of trade execution, improperly settled trades, resolution of trade error claims, system failures, failure to protect their confidential or personal information, mismanagement or even fraud. We may become subject to these claims as the result of delays, failures or malfunctions of our electronic trading platform and the services provided by us. We could incur significant legal expenses defending claims, even those without merit. An adverse resolution of any lawsuits or claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n35\nLiquidity and Funding Risks\nWe cannot predict our future capital needs or our ability to obtain additional financing if we need it.\nOur business is dependent upon the availability of adequate funding and regulatory capital under applicable regulatory requirements. The growth of our Open Trading protocols, in particular, is dependent on the willingness of our customers and counterparties to engage in transactions with us and any perceived issues with our capital levels or access to funding could have a material adverse effect on business.\nAs a result of our self-clearing activities, we are also required to finance certain transactions, maintain deposits with various clearing organizations and clearing broker-dealers and maintain a special reserve bank account for the benefit of customers pursuant to SEC Rule 15c3-3.\nAlthough we believe that our available cash resources and borrowing capacity under our credit agreements are sufficient to meet our presently anticipated liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months, we may in the future need to raise additional funds to, among other things:\nIn addition, our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects our trading customers or counterparties, other third parties or us.\nAll or part of any debt financing could be pursuant to the terms of our credit agreements with third party lenders, which include restrictive covenants with respect to dividends, issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business.\nIn the future, we may not be able to obtain additional financing, if needed, in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on terms acceptable to us, our ability to fund our expansion, finance transactions and maintain margin deposits at clearing organizations, take advantage of acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance our services or products, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. These limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that could limit our operating flexibility, and we may incur additional debt in the future that may include similar or additional restrictions.\nWe are party to a credit agreement that provides for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of $500.0 million. Subject to the satisfaction of certain specified conditions, we are permitted to upsize the borrowing capacity of the credit agreement by an additional $250.0 million. Our credit agreement contains certain covenants that, among other things, may restrict our ability to take certain actions, even if we believe them to be in our best interests. These covenants may restrict or prohibit, among other things, our ability to:\nWe are also required by our credit agreement to maintain a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio, a minimum regulatory net capital balance for certain subsidiaries and a minimum consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) level. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these requirements or satisfy these covenants in the future. A breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in an event of default under the credit agreement. If any such event of default occurs, the lenders under the credit agreement could elect to declare all amounts outstanding and accrued and unpaid interest under the credit agreement to be immediately due and payable, and could foreclose on the assets securing the credit agreement. The lenders would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further credit extensions. We may incur other indebtedness in the future that may contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable to the credit agreement.\n36"

Over 1,800 institutional investor and broker-dealer firms are active users of our patented trading technology, accessing global liquidity on our platforms in U.S. investment-grade bonds, U.S. high-yield bonds, U.S. Treasuries, emerging market debt, Eurobonds and other fixed income securities. Through our\nOpen Trading™\nprotocols, we execute bond trades between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients in the leading all-to-all anonymous trading environment for corporate bonds. We also offer a number of trading-related products and services, including: Composite+\nTM\npricing and other market data products to assist clients with trading decisions; auto-execution and other execution services for clients requiring specialized workflow solutions; connectivity solutions that facilitate straight-through processing; and technology services to optimize trading environments. In addition, we provide a range of pre- and post-trade services, including trade matching, trade publication, regulatory transaction reporting and market and reference data across a range of fixed-income and other products\n.\nOur platforms’ innovative technology solutions are designed to increase the number of potential trading counterparties and create a menu of solutions to address different trade sizes and bond liquidity characteristics. Our traditional request-for-quote (“RFQ”) model allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing, executable bids or offers from our broker-dealer clients and execute trades with the broker-dealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond. Our Open Trading protocols complement our RFQ model by increasing the number of potential counterparties and improving liquidity by allowing all participants to interact anonymously in an all-to-all trading environment. Clients can use our auto-execution technology with both our traditional RFQ and Open Trading protocols, thereby using rules-based execution to connect to diverse sources of liquidity while reducing trading inefficiencies and human errors. Leveraging the benefits of our Open Trading marketplace, we launched Live Markets, an order book that will create a single view of two-way, actionable prices for the most active bonds, including newly issued debt, benchmark issues and news-driven securities. We expect that Open Trading participants will improve their trading capacity through the Live Markets order book, by more efficiently trading liquid names in larger size and accessing integrated real-time market data, such as Composite+\n.\nWe derive revenue from commissions for trades executed on our platform, information services, post-trade services and other revenues. Our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, technology and communication expenses, professional and consulting fees, occupancy, marketing and advertising, clearing costs and other general and administrative expenses.\nOur objective is to provide the leading global electronic trading platforms for fixed-income securities, connecting broker-dealers and institutional investors more easily and efficiently, while offering a broad array of trading information and technology services to market participants across the trading cycle. The key elements of our strategy are:\n42\nCritical Factors Affecting Our Industry and Our Company\nEconomic, Political and Market Factors\nThe global fixed-income securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic, political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors include, among others, credit market conditions, the current interest rate environment, including the volatility of interest rates and investors’ forecasts of future interest rates, economic and political conditions in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and the consolidation or contraction of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients.\nDuring the first half of 2020, the global economy experienced a period of significant turmoil due to the outbreak of COVID-19 (the “Pandemic”). The Pandemic triggered a steep drop in economic activity that had an immediate and substantial impact on global credit markets. Credit yield spreads in U.S. corporate bonds, as measured by the Credit Suisse Liquid U.S. Corporate Index (“LUCI Index”), increased from 1.1% over U.S Treasuries in December 2019 to 1.5% in March 2020 and credit spread volatility in U.S. corporate bonds, as measured by the LUCI Index, increased from 1.1% in December 2019 to 11.6% in March 2020. Drastic measures taken by central banks and governments helped restore confidence in the credit markets in the second half of 2020, which led to a tightening in credit spreads that helped stimulate record new issuance in U.S. investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds. During the second half of 2020, the credit markets continued to improve as credit yield spreads and credit spread volatility tightened to pre-Pandemic levels. The volatile market conditions in 2020 led to an active credit trading environment as the average daily trading volume of U.S. high-grade and high-yield corporate bonds for the year ended December 31, 2020, as measured by Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (“TRACE”), increased by 13.7% and 19.7%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAs a result of the Pandemic, we have experienced significant changes in our daily operations. In mid-March 2020, we successfully implemented a global work from home mandate for all our employees and we were able to continue to provide our trading platforms and other services to our clients without interruption. In particular, we believe that Open Trading liquidity has been increasingly essential to the functioning of credit markets during the Pandemic, and MarketAxess has played a valuable role keeping our clients connected to the market as traders moved from their centralized trading floors to home offices. During the first several months of the Pandemic, we helped over 10,000 individual users connect to our trading platforms from their homes. Although we have reprioritized certain technology projects due to the changing needs of our clients in the current market environment, we have largely continued with our hiring plans, capital expenditures and the expansion of our trading platforms and services into new jurisdictions.\nThe global spread of the Pandemic is complex and rapidly-evolving, with authorities around the world implementing numerous measures to try to contain the coronavirus, such as travel bans and restrictions, social distancing, quarantines, stay at home orders, business limitations and, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, vaccinations. While we remain confident that we can continue to maintain business continuity, serve our clients and provide efficient execution in a virtual environment as necessary, we have re-opened our offices and have allowed our employees to return to work, on a voluntary basis, where local regulations permit. The re-opening of offices has created additional risks and operational challenges relating to maintaining the health and safety of our employees. We also anticipate that the full re-opening of our offices may require investments in the design, implementation and enforcement of new workplace safety protocols. These efforts may divert management attention, and the protocols may create logistical challenges for our employees which could adversely impact employee productivity and morale.\nWe believe that we have sufficient liquidity and flexibility to operate during any future disruptions caused by the Pandemic. While we have experienced increased market volumes and market share since the outbreak, we are cautious of the damaging impact the Pandemic may have on the global economy in the longer-term and the adverse impact that a global recession could have on liquidity and market volumes in the global credit markets.\nWe expect that current cash and investment balances, in combination with cash flows that are generated from operations and the ability to borrow under our Credit Agreement (as defined below), will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs and planned capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. We have not altered our capital management programs and we have increased our dividend for the 12\nth\nconsecutive year. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, no borrowings under our Credit Agreement and with capital significantly in excess of our regulatory requirements.\nIn response to the current economic conditions, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the “FRBNY”) established a Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (the “Facility”) that lent money, on a recourse basis, to a special purpose vehicle (“SPV”) that\n43\npurchase\nd\ncorporate debt issued by eligible issuers\nin the secondary market\n.\nThe SPV purchase\nd eligible individual corporate bonds\nin the secondary market, as well as eligible corporate bond portfolios in the form of exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”). In September 2020, we were\ndesignated by the\nFRBNY\nas an Eligible Seller for\nthe Facility, which allow\ned\nus to p\nrovide end investors and broker-dealers the\nopportunity to use Open Trading to respond directly and anonymously to the FRBNY’s requests to purchase bonds.\nCompetitive Landscape\nThe global fixed-income securities industry generally, and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular, are highly competitive, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. Sources of competition for us will continue to include, among others, bond trading conducted directly between broker-dealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically and other multi-dealer or all-to-all trading platforms. Competitors, including companies in which some of our broker-dealer clients have invested, have developed or acquired electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms or information networks that may compete with us.\nIn general, we compete on the basis of a number of key factors, including, among others, the liquidity provided on our platform, the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform,\ntotal transaction costs and\nthe quality and speed of execution. We believe that our ability to grow volumes and revenues will largely depend on our performance with respect to these factors.\nOur competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our broker-dealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems. We have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform, working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs.\nRegulatory Environment\nOur business is subject to extensive regulations in the United States and internationally, which may expose us to significant regulatory risk and cause additional legal costs to ensure compliance. The existing legal framework that governs the financial markets is periodically reviewed and amended, resulting in the enactment and enforcement of new laws and regulations that apply to our business. For example, t\nhe new administration elected in the 2020 U.S. presidential election may enact regulatory changes that may affect our business.\nIn 2017, the SEC established a Fixed Income Market Structure Advisory Committee in order to provide the SEC with diverse perspectives on the structure and operations of the U.S. fixed-income markets, as well as advice and recommendations on matters related to fixed-income market structure. The impact of any reform efforts on us and our operations remains uncertain\n.\nIn addition,\nthe U.K. ceased to be a member of the E.U. on January 31, 2020, triggering a transition period in which the U.K. continued to observe applicable E.U. regulations through December 31, 2020\n(commonly referred to as “Brexit”). In preparation for Brexit, we obtained authorizations from the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets for our subsidiaries in the Netherlands in 2019. Following Brexit, we now provide regulated services to our clients within the E.U. in reliance on the cross-border services passport held by our Dutch subsidiaries. Brexit has led to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate, which may impact our ability to comply with the extensive government regulation to which we are subject. In addition, the cost and complexity of operating across increasingly divergent regulatory regimes is likely to increase following Brexit\n.\nCompliance with regulations may require us to dedicate additional financial and operational resources, which may adversely affect our profitability. However, we believe new regulations may also increase demand for our platforms and we believe we are well positioned to benefit from those regulatory changes that cause market participants to seek electronic platforms that meet the various regulatory requirements and help them comply with their regulatory obligations\n.\nOn August 10, 2020, MarketAxess Corporation, our broker-dealer subsidiary, converted to self-clearing for the U.S bond trades to which MarketAxess Corporation is a counterparty via its Open Trading functionality. Previously, these bond transactions were settled through a third-party clearing broker. As a result of this conversion, MarketAxess Corporation is required to segregate funds in a special reserve bank account for the benefit of customers pursuant to Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n44\nTechnolog\ny\nEnvironment\nWe must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform. The electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models. Our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services, develop and/or license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and prospective broker-dealer and institutional investor clients and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis. We plan to continue to focus on technology infrastructure initiatives and continually improve our platforms to further enhance our leading market position. We expect that our transition to agile software development processes will help us continue to be a market leader in developing the technology solutions for our clients’ trading needs.\nWe experience cyber-attacks and attempted security breaches. Cybersecurity incidents could impact revenue and operating income and increase costs. We therefore continue to make investments, which may result in increased costs, to strengthen our cybersecurity measures. See also Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\n, “Technology, IT Systems and Cybersecurity Risks -\nOur actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws, regulations, and obligations could harm our business.”\nTrends in Our Business\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from commissions for transactions executed on our platforms between and among our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients and monthly distribution fees. We believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of such transactions on our platforms and the amount of commissions and distribution fees earned by us\n:\nWe believe that overall corporate bond market trading volume is affected by various factors including the absolute levels of interest rates, the direction of interest rate movements, the level of new issues of corporate bonds and the volatility of corporate bond spreads versus U.S. Treasury securities. Because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platforms, it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes, regardless of the cause of such decline, would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on profitability\n.\nCommission Revenue\nCommissions are recognized on a trade date basis and generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platforms and vary based on the type, size, yield and maturity of the bond traded and individual client incentives. Bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions, while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions.\nFor Open Trading trades that we execute between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller, we earn our commission through the difference in price between the two trades. For U.S. Treasury matched principal trades, commissions are invoiced and recorded on a monthly basis.\nU.S. High-Grade Corporate Bond Commissions.\nOur U.S. high-grade corporate bond fee plans generally incorporate variable transaction fees and fixed distribution fees billed to our broker-dealer clients on a monthly basis. Certain dealers participate in fee programs that do not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporate additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments. Under these fee plans, we electronically add the transaction fee to the spread quoted by the broker-dealer client. The U.S. high-grade transaction fee is generally designated in basis points in yield and, as a result, is subject to fluctuation depending on the duration of the bond traded. The average U.S. high-grade fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in yield, years-to-maturity and nominal size of bonds traded on our platforms. Distribution fees include any unused monthly fee commitments under our variable fee plans.\n45\nOther Credit Commissions.\nOther credit includes Eurobonds, emerging markets bonds, high-yield bonds\n,\nmunicipal bonds\nand leveraged loans\n. Commissions for other credit products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded using standard fee schedules.\nOur high-yield fee plan structure is\ns\nimilar to our U.S. high-grade fee plans\n.\nC\nertain dealers participate in a high-yield fee plan that incorporates a variable transaction fee and fixed distribution fee, while other\ndealers participate in a plan that does not contain monthly distribution fees and instead incorporates additional per transaction execution fees and minimum monthly fee commitments. The average other credit fees per million may vary in the future due to changes in product mix or trading protocols\n.\nRates Commissions.\nRates includes U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency, European government bonds and credit derivatives. Commissions for rates products generally vary based on the type of the instrument traded. U.S. Treasury fee plans are typically volume tiered and can vary based on the trading protocol. The average rates fee per million may vary in the future due to changes in product mix or trading protocols.\nWe anticipate that average fees per million may change in the future. Consequently, past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions.\nInformation Services\nWe generate revenue from data licensed to our broker-dealer clients, institutional investor clients and data-only subscribers; professional and consulting services; technology software licenses; and maintenance and support services. These revenues are either for subscription-based services transferred over time, and may be net of volume-based discounts, or one-time services. Revenues for services transferred over time are recognized ratably over the contract period while revenues for services transferred at a point in time are recognized in the period the services are provided. Customers are generally billed monthly, quarterly, or annually; revenues billed in advance are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period.\nPost-trade Services\nWe generate revenue from regulatory transaction reporting, trade publication and trade matching services. Customers are generally billed monthly in arrears and revenue is recognized in the period that the transactions are processed. Revenues billed in advance are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period. We also generate one-time implementation fees for onboarding clients which are invoiced and recognized in the period the implementation is complete.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue includes revenue generated from telecommunications line charges to broker-dealer clients.\nExpenses\nIn the normal course of business, we incur the following expenses:\nEmployee Compensation and Benefits.\nEmployee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries, stock-based compensation costs, other incentive compensation, employee benefits and payroll taxes.\nDepreciation and Amortization.\nWe depreciate our computer hardware and related software, office hardware and furniture and fixtures and amortize our capitalized software development costs on a straight-line basis over three to seven years. We amortize leasehold improvements on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease. Intangible assets with definite lives, including purchased technologies, customer relationships and other intangible assets, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to 15 years, using either a straight-line or accelerated amortization method based on the pattern of economic benefit that we expect to realize from such assets. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment.\nTechnology and Communications.\nTechnology and communications expense consists primarily of costs relating to maintenance on software and hardware, our internal network connections, data center hosting costs, data feeds provided by outside vendors or service providers and US treasuries licensing fees. The majority of our broker-dealer clients have dedicated high-speed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer. We charge our broker-dealer clients a monthly fee for these connections, which is recovered against the relevant expenses we incur.\nProfessional and Consulting Fees.\nProfessional and consulting fees consist primarily of accounting fees, legal fees and fees paid to information technology and other consultants for services provided for the maintenance of our trading platforms, information and post-trade services products and other services.\n46\nOccupancy.\nOccupancy costs consist primarily of office and equipment rent, utilities and commercial rent tax\n.\nMarketing and Advertising.\nMarketing and advertising expense consists primarily of print and other advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and services. This expense also includes costs associated with attending or exhibiting at industry-sponsored seminars, conferences and conventions, and travel and entertainment expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading platforms, information services and post-trade services.\nClearing Costs.\nClearing costs consist of fees that we are charged by third-party clearing brokers and depositories for the clearing and settlement of matched principal trades, regulatory reporting fees and variable transaction fees assessed by the provider of our third-party middle office system.\nGeneral and Administrative.\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of general travel and entertainment, board of directors’ expenses, charitable contributions, provision for doubtful accounts and various state franchise and U.K. value-added taxes.\nExpenses may grow in the future, notably in employee compensation and benefits, as we increase headcount to support investment in new products, operational support and geographic expansion, depreciation and amortization due to increased investment in new products and enhancements to our trading platforms, and technology and communication costs. Expenses may also grow due to acquisitions.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInvestment Income\n. Investment income consists of income earned on our investments.\nInterest Expense.\nInterest expense consists of financing charges incurred on short-term borrowings.\nOther, Net.\nOther, net consists of unrealized gains or losses on trading security investments, realized gains or losses on investments, foreign currency transaction gains or losses, investment advisory fees, credit facility administrative fees and other miscellaneous revenues and expenses.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, also referred to as U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\n47\nSegment Results\nWe operate electronic platforms for the trading of fixed-income securities and provide related data, analytics, compliance tools and post-trade services. We consider our operations to constitute a single business segment because of the highly integrated nature of these product and services, the financial markets in which we compete and our worldwide business activities. We believe that results by geographic region or client sector are not necessarily meaningful in understanding our business.\nSee Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for certain geographic information about our business required by U.S. GAAP.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe comparability of our results of operations is impacted by our acquisition of LiquidityEdge in November 2019 which enabled us to expand our trading capabilities to include U.S. Treasuries. For additional information regarding this acquisition, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The following table summarizes our financial results, which includes LiquidityEdge related revenue and expenses of $13.1 million and $14.5 million, respectively, recognized during 2020 and $2.5 million and $3.8 million, respectively, recognized during 2019:\nRevenues\nOur revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the resulting dollar and percentage changes, were as follows:\n48\nCommissions\nOur commission revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the resulting dollar and percentage changes, were as follows:\nU.S. high-grade variable transaction fees increased $79.7 million due to a 29.4% increase in trading volume and a 12.7% increase in the variable transaction fee per million. Other credit variable transaction fees increased $68.2 million due to a 29.5% increase in trading volume and a 5.2% increase in the variable transaction fee per million. Open Trading credit volume increased by 60.8% and represented 33.2% and 27.0% of credit variable transaction fees for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The 236.5% increase in variable transaction fees for rates was attributable to the inclusion of U.S. Treasuries trading volume and commissions following the November 1, 2019 acquisition of LiquidityEdge.\nOur trading volume for each of the years presented was as follows:\nFor volume reporting purposes, transactions in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars at average monthly rates. The 29.4% increase in our U.S. high-grade volume was principally due to an increase in estimated overall market volume coupled with growth in our estimated market share. Our estimated market share of total U.S. high-grade corporate bond volume increased to 21.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 19.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Estimated U.S. high-grade TRACE volume increased by 14.2% to $6.3 trillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $5.6 trillion for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n49\nOther cr\nedit volumes increased by 29.5\n% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, prim\narily due to increases of 68.4\n% in\nU.S. high-yield bond volume, 21.3% in\nEur\nobond volume and 14.8\n% in emerging markets bond volume on a combination of higher estimated U.S. high-yield market volume and higher U.S. high-yield, emerging markets and Eur\no\nbond estimated market\nshare\n. Our estimated market share of U.S. high-yield\nTRACE volume increased to 14.6\n% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe significant increase in rates volume was attributable to the inclusion of U.S. Treasuries trading volumes following the November 1, 2019 acquisition of LiquidityEdge.\nOur average variable transaction fee per million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\nThe increase in U.S. high-grade average variable transaction fee per million was mainly due to an increase in the duration of bonds traded on the platforms. The increase in Other credit average variable transaction fee per million was mainly due to a larger percentage of trading volume in high-yield bonds that command higher fees per million. The significant decrease in the average variable transaction fee per million for rates products was primarily attributable to the inclusion of U.S. Treasuries trading volumes that command lower fees per million.\nInformation Services.\nInformation services revenue increased $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 mainly due to revenue from new data contracts.\nPost-Trade\nServices. Post-trade services revenue increased $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 principally due to additional regulatory transaction reporting revenue of $1.3 million generated by Regulatory Reporting Hub since the November 30, 2020 acquisition date and the introduction of new SFTR reporting services of $0.9 million.\nOther.\nOther revenue was $0.9 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n50\nExpenses\nThe following table summarizes our expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 include $14.5 million and $3.8 million, respectively, of expenses related to LiquidityEdge, including amortization of acquired intangibles expense of $2.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\nEmployee compensation and benefits increased by $25.8 million primarily due increases in salaries, taxes and benefits on higher employee headcount of $16.0 million and employee incentive compensation of $9.1 million, which is tied to operating performance. The total number of employees increased to 606 as of December 31, 2020 from 527 as of December 31, 2019.\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $9.1 million primarily due to higher amortization of software development costs of $5.0 million and amortization of acquired intangibles of $3.1 million. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $15.0 million and $12.3 million, respectively, of equipment purchases and leasehold improvements and $30.6 million and $22.4 million, respectively, of software development costs were capitalized.\nTechnology and communications expenses increased by $7.3 million primarily due to higher IT license and support costs of $3.2 million, U.S. Treasury platform licensing costs of $2.6 million and cloud hosting costs of $1.8 million.\nProfessional and consulting fees increased by $6.8 million primarily due to higher consulting fees related to our self-clearing and settlements initiatives of $2.5 million, audit and tax fees of $1.2 million, recruiting fees of $1.1 million and acquisition-related expenses of $1.1 million.\nOccupancy costs increased by $1.8 million primarily due to rent expense associated with additional leased office space in London.\nMarketing and advertising expense decreased $3.6 million due to reduced sales-related travel and entertainment activities as a result of the Pandemic.\nClearing costs increased by $9.7 million primarily due to a $6.0 million increase in clearing costs associated with Open Trading matched principal credit transactions and a $3.7 million increase in clearing costs associated with U.S. Treasuries matched principal transactions. Clearing costs as a percentage of Open Trading matched principal credit trading revenue decreased to 9.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 11.0% for the year ended December 31, 2019 principally due to higher Open Trading variable transaction fee per million and transaction cost savings resulting from our conversion to self-clearing U.S. bonds, offset by certain non-recurring self-clearing conversion costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $3.0 million primarily due to lower general travel and entertainment expense as a result of the Pandemic.\n51\nOther Income (Expense)\nOur other income (expense) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the resulting dollar and percentage changes, were as follows:\nInvestment income decreased by $5.6 million primarily due to lower investment balances, due in part to the cash paid for the acquisition of LiquidityEdge in November 2019 of $104.4 million and new self-clearing related deposit, reserve and liquidity requirements, and a decrease in interest rates.\nInterest\nexpense increased by $1.1 million due to short-term borrowing activity in 2020 to support self-clearing activity.\nOther, net decreased by $0.2 million primarily due to an increase in credit facility administration costs of $0.8 million, offset by net realized gains on investments of $0.5 million in 2020.\nProvision for Income Taxes.\nThe provision for income taxes and effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nThe provision for income taxes reflected $24.1 million and $10.6 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards that vested or were exercised during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded an additional provision for unrecognized tax benefits of $9.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on the geographic mix of our earnings, changes in tax legislation and tax rates and the amount and timing of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments, among other factors.\n52\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nOur quarterly results have varied significantly as a result of:\nThe following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly income statement data for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2020. In our opinion, this unaudited information has been prepared on a basis consistent with our annual financial statements and includes all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the unaudited quarterly data. This information should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that we may achieve for any subsequent periods.\n53\nThe following tables set forth trading volume and average variable transaction fee per million for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDuring the past two years, we have met our funding requirements through cash on hand, internally generated funds and short-term borrowings. Cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled $489.0 million at December 31, 2020. Our investments are generally invested in investment-grade securities. We limit the amounts that can be invested in any single issuer and invest in short- to intermediate-term instruments whose fair values are less sensitive to interest rate changes. We believe our investments as of December 31, 2020 that were in an unrealized loss position were not other-than-temporarily impaired. In addition, we believe there has not been any event after such date, including the recent developments related to the Pandemic, that would indicate any other-than-temporary impairment.\n54\nOn August 19, 2020, we amended our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Prior Credit Agreement”) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan”) to, among other things, (\ni\n) permit investments of up to $500\n.0\nmillion in MarketAxess Corporation and (ii) increase the aggregate commitments of the lender under the\nPrior\nCredit Agreement from $100\n.0\nmillion to $450\n.0\nmillion, which we intend to use from time to time to make advances to our broker-dealer subsidiaries to assist with certain capital or liquidity requirements related to our self-clearing and trade settlement activities and for other general corporate purposes. The Prior Credit Agreement matured on November 13, 2020, when we entered into a new credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders and JPMorgan, as administrative agent\n, that provides\naggregate commitments totaling $500\n.0\nmillion, consisting of a revolving credit f\nacility\nand a $5\n.0\nmillion letter of credit sub-limit for standby letters of credit.\nThe\nCredit Agreement\nwill mature on November 12, 2021, with\nour\noption to request up to two additional 364-day extensions at the discretion of each lender and subject to customary conditions.\nAs of\nDecember\n3\n1\n, 2020, we had $\n1.0\nmillion in letters of credit outstanding and $\n4\n99\n.0\nmillion in available borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement\n.\nSee Note 1\n3\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of\nthe\nCredit Agreement and the Prior Credit Agreement\n.\nIn connection with its self-clearing operations, MarketAxess Corporation, our broker-dealer subsidiary, entered into an agreement (the “Collateralized Agreement”) with its settlement bank to provide loans up to an aggregate of $200.0 million on an uncommitted basis. Borrowings under the Collateralized Agreement are collateralized by securities pledged by MarketAxess Corporation to the settlement bank, subject to applicable haircuts and concentration limits. As of December 31, 2020, MarketAxess Corporation had no borrowings outstanding and $200.0 million in available borrowing capacity under the Collateralized Agreement. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Collateralized Agreement.\nAs a result of our self-clearing activities, we are required to finance certain transactions, maintain deposits with various clearing organizations and clearing broker-dealers and maintain a special reserve bank account for the benefit of customers pursuant to SEC Rule 15c3-3. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of the positions financed, deposits and customer reserve balances associated with our self-clearing activities was $138.2 million. These requirements can fluctuate based on trading activity, market volatility or other factors which may impact our liquidity or require us to use our capital resources.\nDuring the past two years, our cash flows were as follows:\nCash Flows for the Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe $138.6 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in net income of $94.5 million, net sales and maturities of trading investments of $63.9 million, income and other tax liabilities of $16.0 million, depreciation and amortization of $9.1 million and accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $6.8 million. These increases in cash provided were offset by an increase of $49.5 million in net receivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers associated with our self-clearing conversion.\nThe $190.9 million net increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net proceeds from sales and maturities of securities available-for-sale of $127.7 million and lower cash used for acquisitions of $74.1 million, offset by an increase in capital expenditures of $10.9 million.\nThe $27.0 million increase in net cash (used in) financing activities was principally due to increases in withholding tax payments on restricted stock vesting and stock option exercises of $16.6 million and cash dividends paid on common stock of $14.3 million, offset by an increase in exercises of stock options of $2.8 million and a decrease in repurchases of our common stock of $1.1 million.\nPast trends of cash flows are not necessarily indicative of future cash flow levels. A decrease in cash flows may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business and financial condition.\n55\nOther Factors Influencing Liquidity and Capital Resources\nWe believe that our current resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including liquidity requirements associated with our self-clearing operations and expenses associated with product development and expansion and new business opportunities that are intended to further diversify our revenue stream. We may also acquire or invest in technologies, business ventures or products that are complementary to our business. In the event we require any additional financing, it will take the form of equity or debt financing. Any additional equity offerings may result in dilution to our stockholders. Any debt financings, if available at all, may involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends, issuances of additional capital and other financial and operational matters related to our business.\nCertain of our U.S. subsidiaries are registered as a broker-dealer or a SEF and therefore are subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, FINRA and the CFTC. These rules contain minimum net capital requirements, as defined in the applicable regulations, and also may require that a significant part of the registrants’ assets be kept in relatively liquid form. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries are regulated by the FCA in the U.K. or other foreign regulators and must maintain financial resources, as defined in the applicable regulations, in excess of the applicable financial resources requirement. As of December 31, 2020, each of our subsidiaries that are subject to these regulations had net capital or financial resources in excess of their minimum requirements. As of December 31, 2020, our subsidiaries maintained aggregate net capital and financial resources that were $435.4 million in excess of the required levels of $21.6 million.\nEach of our U.S. and foreign regulated subsidiaries are subject to local regulations which generally prohibit repayment of borrowings from our affiliates, paying cash dividends, making loans to our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator. As of December 31, 2020, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries was $144.4 million.\nWe execute bond transactions between our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades. In August 2020, one of our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries converted to a self-clearing model for the settlement of such transactions. Our other U.S. and U.K subsidiaries continue to settle their transactions through third-party clearing brokers. Settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. Under both the self-clearing and the third-party clearing broker models, we are exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction or if there is a miscommunication or other error in executing a matched principal transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreements, each third-party clearing broker has the right to charge us for any losses they suffer resulting from a counterparty’s failure on any of our trades. We did not record any liabilities or losses with regard to counterparty failures for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations, warranties and general indemnifications. Our maximum exposure from any claims under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve claims that have not yet occurred. However, based on past experience, we expect the risk of material loss to be remote.\nOn November 30, 2020 we acquired Regulatory Services GmbH, the pan-European regulatory reporting business of\nDeutsche Börse Group.\nThe purchase price was approximately $22.5 million in cash paid at closing and up to $24.6 million in contingent consideration payable within 18 months of the closing.\nIn September 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire MuniBrokers LLC, a central electronic venue serving municipal bond inter-dealer brokers and dealers. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions\n. The purchase price is approximately $45.0 million in cash, plus transaction costs, with $20.0 million paid at closing and up to $25.0 million in contingent consideration payable within three years of the closing.\nSee Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our repurchases of our common stock and our dividend policy.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures called earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and free cash flow (“FCF”). As a result of our conversion to self-clearing, we redefined FCF as cash flow from operating activities excluding the net change in trading investments and\nnet change in securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers,\nless expenditures for furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, are important in understanding our operating\n56\nresults. EBITDA and FCF are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity. We believe that EBITDA and FCF provide useful additional information concerning profitability of our operations and business trends and the cash flow available to pay dividends, repurchase stock and meet working capital requirements.\nThe table set forth below presents a reconciliation of our net income to EBITDA, as defined, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nThe table set forth below presents a reconciliation of our net cash provided by operating activities to FCF, as defined, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nEffects of Inflation\nBecause the majority of our assets are short-term in nature, they are not significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation may affect our expenses, such as employee compensation, office leasing costs and communications expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of our services. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the securities markets, it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\n57\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had the following contractual obligations and commitments:\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the net investment in our U.K. subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, the notional value of the foreign currency forward contract outstanding was $157.1 million and the fair value of the liability was $0.8 million.\n58"

    "text": "Market Risk\nMarket risk is the risk of the loss resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe global financial services business is, by its nature, risky and volatile and is directly affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control. Any one of these factors may cause a substantial decline in the U.S. and global financial services markets, resulting in reduced trading volume and revenues. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $19.2 million of investments in corporate bonds that were classified as trading securities. Adverse movements, such as a 10% decrease in the value of these securities or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these securities, could result in a substantial loss. In addition, principal gains and losses resulting from these securities could on occasion have a disproportionate effect, positive or negative, on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period.\nSee also Item 1A\n. Risk Factors\n, “Risks Related to Global Economic and Market Conditions –\nGlobal economic, political and market factors beyond our control could reduce demand for our services, and our profitability and business could suffer\n.”\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk represents our exposure to interest rate changes with respect to our cash, cash equivalents and investments. As of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents and investments amounted to $489.0 million. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would decrease our annual investment income by approximately $4.8 million, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents.\nA similar hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of the trading securities portfolio by approximately $0.2 million. The hypothetical unrealized gain (loss) of $0.2 million would be recognized in other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nWe do not maintain an inventory of bonds that are traded on our platform.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe conduct operations in several different countries outside of the U.S., most notably the U.K., and substantial portions of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are generated and denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies. Since our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Accordingly, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against the other currencies will affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 10.8% of our revenue and 26.2% of our expenses were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, most notably the British Pound Sterling. Based on actual results over the past year, a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the U.S. dollar against all other currencies would have increased or decreased revenue by approximately $7.5 million and operating expenses by approximately $7.6 million.\nDerivative Risk\nOur limited derivative risk stems from our activities in the foreign currency forward contract market. We use this market to mitigate our U.S. dollar versus British Pound Sterling exposure that arises from the activities of our U.K. subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of the notional amount of our foreign currency forward contract was $157.9 million. We do not speculate in any derivative instruments.\n59\nCredit Risk\nThrough certain of our subsidiaries, we execute bond transactions between our institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades. In August 2020, one of our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries converted to a self-clearing model for the settlement of such transactions. Our other U.S. and U.K subsidiaries continue to settle their transactions through third-party clearing brokers. Settlement typically occurs within one to two trading days after the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded.\nWe are exposed to credit and performance risks in our role as matched principal trading counterparty to our clients executing bond trades on our platform, including the risk that counterparties that owe us money or securities will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. Adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk. In connection with Open Trading or other anonymous protocols, we expect that the number of transactions in which we act as a matched principal will increase.\nWe have policies, procedures and automated controls in place to identify and manage our credit risk. There can be no assurance that these policies, procedures and automated controls will effectively mitigate our credit risk exposure. Some of our risk management procedures are reliant upon the evaluation of information regarding the fixed-income markets, our clients or other relevant matters that are publicly available or otherwise acquired from third party sources. Such information may not be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly assessed and interpreted by us. If our risk management procedures fail, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our insurance policies are unlikely to provide coverage for such risks.\nCash and cash equivalents includes cash and money market instruments that are primarily maintained at three major global banks. Given this concentration, we are exposed to certain credit risk in relation to our deposits at these banks.\n60"

    "text": "MARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe unaudited supplementary data regarding consolidated quarterly income statement data are incorporated by reference to the information set forth in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in the section captioned “Quarterly Results of Operations.”\n61\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement of MarketAxess Holdings Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n.\nBased on our assessment and those criteria, management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\n62\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of MarketAxess Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n63\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - Open Trading Commissions\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\nexecutes trades between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller (“Open Trading”). Open Trading\nvariable transaction fees, which represent commissions for matched principal trades, were $170.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Variable transaction fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platform and vary based on the type, size, yield, maturity of the bond traded, and individual client incentives. For Open Trading trades, the Company earns its commission through the difference in price between the two trades. As disclosed by management, commissions are determined based on the fee schedule associated with the instrument being traded.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for Open Trading commissions is a critical audit matter are the significant audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating evidence related to this revenue type, which is calculated based on the instrument being traded, volume of the instrument being traded, and individual client incentives.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the completeness and accuracy of Open Trading commission. These procedures also included, among others, testing a sample of Open Trading transactions by (i) agreeing the details of the trade to underlying documentation, (ii) agreeing fees charged to the fee schedule based on the trade details, and as applicable, any individual client incentives, and (iii) recalculating the Open Trading commission variable transaction fee.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 19, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2000.\n64\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\n65\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n66\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n67\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n68\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nmarketaxess holdings inc.\n69\nnotes to consolidated financial statements\n1.

Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior periods’ consolidated financial statements in order to conform to the current period presentation. Such reclassifications are immaterial, individually and in the aggregate, to both current and all previously issued financial statements taken as a whole and have no effect on previously reported net income.\nAccounting Pronouncements, Recently Adopted\nIn August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-15, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software: Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract” (“ASU 2018-15”). The standard requires the capitalization of implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement to be aligned with the requirements for capitalizing costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The Company adopted ASU 2018-15 effective\nJuly 1, 2019\non a prospective basis. Adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other” (“ASU 2017-04”). ASU 2017-04 simplifies the testing for goodwill impairment, which eliminates the requirement to determine the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit to measure goodwill impairment. Instead, goodwill impairment testing will be performed by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognizing impairment by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The Company adopted ASU 2017-04 effective\nJanuary 1, 2020\non a prospective basis. Adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) -Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”. This ASU amends several aspects of the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, including replacing the existing incurred credit loss model and other models with the Current Expected Credit Losses model (“CECL”). Under CECL, the allowance for losses for financial assets that are measured at amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of the financial assets. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, would be recognized in earnings. Expected credit losses will be measured based on historical experience, current conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. The Company adopted this ASU on\nJanuary 1, 2020\nusing the modified retrospective method of adoption. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAccounting Pronouncements, Not Yet Adopted\n70\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting”, which is designed to ease the potential burden in accounting for the transition away from LIBOR. The ASU applies to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued and replaced with alternative reference rates as a result of reference rate reform. The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The ASU\nwas\neffective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 and can be adopted from this date through December 31, 2022. The Company does not expect adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its Consolidated\nF\ninancial\nS\ntatements.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company defines cash equivalents as short-term interest-bearing investments with maturities at the time of purchase of\nthree months\nor less.\nInvestments\nThe Company determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase which are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition on the trade date. Securities are classified as available-for-sale or trading. The Company’s available-for-sale investments are comprised of investment-grade corporate debt securities. Available-for-sale investments are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Trading investments include investment-grade corporate debt securities and U.S. Treasuries and are carried at fair value, with realized and unrealized gains or losses included in other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company assesses whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss on the available-for-sale investments has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions. The portion of an other-than-temporary impairment related to credit loss is recorded as a charge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The remainder is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss if the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery.\nNo\ncharges for other-than-temporary losses were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nFair Value Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as “the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.” A three-tiered hierarchy for determining fair value has been established that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value calculations. The three levels of inputs are defined as Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets), Level 2 (inputs that are observable in the marketplace other than those inputs classified in Level 1) and Level 3 (inputs that are unobservable in the marketplace). The Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of its money market funds, securities available-for-sale, trading securities and foreign currency forward contracts. All other financial instruments are short-term in nature and the carrying amount is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at approximate fair value.\nReceivables from and Payables to Broker-dealers, Clearing Organizations and Customers\nReceivables from broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers include amounts receivable for securities not delivered by the Company to the purchaser by the settlement date (‘‘securities failed-to-deliver’’) and cash deposits held at clearing organizations and clearing brokers to facilitate the settlement and clearance of matched principal transactions. Payables to broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers include amounts payable for securities not received by the Company from a seller by the settlement date (‘‘securities failed-to-receive’’). Securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive for transactions executed between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis where the Company’s U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary serves as a counterparty to both the buyer and the seller are recorded on a settlement date basis. The Company presents its securities failed-to-deliver and securities failed-to-receive balances on a net-by-counterparty basis within receivables from and payables to broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers. The difference between the Company’s trade-date receivables and payables for unsettled matched principal transactions reflects commissions earned and is recorded within accounts receivable, net on a trade-date basis.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nAll accounts receivable have contractual maturities of less than\none year\nand are derived from trading-related fees and commissions and revenues from products and services. The Company continually monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for credit losses is based on an estimate of the amount of potential credit losses in existing accounts receivable, as determined from a review of aging schedules, past due balances, historical collection experience and other specific collection issues that have been identified. Account balances are grouped for evaluation based on various risk characteristics, including billing type, legal entity, and geographic region. Additions to the allowance for credit losses are charged to bad debt expense, which is included in general and administrative expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Balances that are determined to be uncollectable are written off against the allowance for credit losses.\n71\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThe allowance for credit losses was $\n0.2\nmillion, $\n0.1\nmillion and $\n0.1\nmillion as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The provision for bad debts was $\n0.5\nmillion, $\n0.3\nmillion and $\n0.2\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Write-offs and other charges against the allowance for credit losses were $\n0.1\nmillion, $\n0.1\nmillion and $\n0.2\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nFixed assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company uses the straight-line method of depreciation over\nthree\nto\nseven\nyears\n. The Company amortizes leasehold improvements on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease.\nSoftware Development Costs\nThe Company capitalizes certain costs associated with the development of internal use software, including among other items, employee compensation and related benefits and third-party consulting costs at the point at which the conceptual formulation, design and testing of possible software project alternatives have been completed. Once the product is ready for its intended use, such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over\nthree years\n. The Company reviews the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable.\nCloud Computing Costs\nThe Company capitalizes certain costs associated with cloud computing arrangements, including, among other items, employee compensation and related benefits and third-party consulting costs that are part of the application development stage. These costs are setup as a prepaid asset on the balance sheet and are amortized over the period of the hosting service contract. The Company reviews the amounts capitalized for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable.\nForeign Currency Translation and Forward Contracts\nAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using exchange rates at the end of the period; revenues and expenses are translated at average monthly rates. Gains and losses on foreign currency translation are a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Transaction gains and losses are recorded in other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its net investment in its U.K. subsidiaries. Gains and losses on these transactions are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company’s classification of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations represents revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated by type of revenue. The Company has\nfour\nrevenue streams as described below.\nCommission Revenue.\nThe Company charges its broker-dealer clients variable transaction fees for trades executed on its platform and, under certain plans, distribution fees or monthly minimum fees to use the platform for a particular product area. Variable transaction fees are recognized on a trade date basis and generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on the platforms and vary based on the type, size, yield and maturity of the bond traded and individual client incentives. Bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities generally generate lower commissions, while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions. Under the Company’s disclosed trading transaction fee plans, variable transaction fees, distribution fees and unused monthly fee commitments are invoiced and recorded on a monthly basis.\nFor Open Trading trades that the Company executes between and among institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller, the Company earns its commission through the difference in price between the two trades.\nThe commission is collected upon settlement of the trade, which typically occurs\nwithin one to two trading days\nafter the trade date. For U.S. Treasury matched principal trades, commissions are invoiced and recorded on a monthly basis.\nThe following table presents commission revenue by fee type:\n72\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nInformation services –\nInformation services includes data licensed to the Company’s broker-dealer clients, institutional investor clients and data-only subscribers; professional and consulting services; technology software licenses; and maintenance and support services. The nature and timing of each performance obligation may vary as these contracts are either subscription-based services transferred over time, and may be net of volume-based discounts, or one-time services that are transferred at a point in time. Revenues for services transferred over time are recognized ratably over the contract period as the Company’s performance obligation is met whereas revenues for services transferred at a point in time are recognized in the period the services are provided. Customers are generally billed monthly, quarterly, or annually; revenues billed in advance are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period.\nThe following table presents information services revenue by timing of recognition:\nPost-trade services –\nPost-trade services revenue is generated from regulatory transaction reporting, trade publication and trade matching services. Customers are generally billed monthly in arrears and revenue is recognized in the period transactions are processed. Revenues billed in advance are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period. The Company also generates one-time implementation fees for onboarding clients which are invoiced and recognized in the period the implementation is completed.\nThe following table presents post-trade services revenue by timing of recognition:\nOther revenues –\nOther revenues primarily includes revenue from telecommunications line charges to broker-dealer clients.\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenues that the Company records when cash payments are received or due in advance of services to be performed.\nThe revenue recognized from contract liabilities and the remaining balance is shown below:\n73\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThe majority of the Company’s contracts are short-term in nature with durations of less than one-year. For contracts with original durations extending beyond one year, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $\n21.1\nmillion as of December 31, 2020. The Company expects to recognize revenue associated with the remaining performance obligations over the next\n33\nmonths.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards based on their estimated fair values measured as of the grant date. These costs are recognized as an expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the requisite service period, which is typically the vesting period, with an offsetting increase to additional paid-in capital. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future years. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All tax effects related to share-based payments are recorded in the provision for income taxes in the periods during which the awards are exercised or vest.\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nBusiness combinations are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The total cost of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates, growth rates, customer attrition rates and asset lives.\nThe Company operates as a single reporting unit. Following an acquisition, goodwill no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition, but instead becomes identifiable with the entire reporting unit. As a result, all of the fair value of the Company is available to support the value of goodwill. An impairment review of goodwill is performed on an annual basis, at year-end, or more frequently if circumstances change. Intangible assets with definite lives, including purchased technologies, customer relationships and other intangible assets, are amortized over their estimated useful lives which range from\none\nto\n15\nyears\nusing either a straight-line or accelerated amortization method based on the pattern of economic benefit the Company expects to realize from such assets. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common stock by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, the weighted-average shares outstanding of common stock reflects the dilutive effect that could occur if convertible securities or other contracts to issue common stock were converted into or exercised for common stock.\n74\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n3. Regulatory Capital Requirements\nCertain U.S. subsidiaries of the Company are registered as a broker-dealer or swap execution facility and therefore are subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. These rules contain minimum net capital requirements, as defined in the applicable regulations, and also may require a significant part of the registrants’ assets be kept in relatively liquid form. Certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. or other foreign regulators and must maintain financial resources, as defined in the applicable regulations, in excess of the applicable financial resources requirement. As of December 31, 2020, each of the Company’s subsidiaries that are subject to these regulations had net capital or financial resources in excess of their minimum requirements. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s subsidiaries maintained aggregate net capital and financial resources that were $\n435.4\nmillion in excess of the required levels of $\n21.6\nmillion.\nIn August 2020, one of the Company’s U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries converted to a self-clearing model for the U.S. bond trades to which it is a counterparty via its Open Trading functionality. Previously, these bond transactions were settled through a third-party clearing broker. As a result of this conversion, the broker-dealer subsidiary is required to segregate funds in a special reserve bank account for the benefit of customers pursuant to Rule 15c3-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As of December 31, 2020, the broker-dealer subsidiary had a balance of $\n50.1\nmillion in its special reserve bank account.\nEach of the Company’s U.S. and foreign regulated subsidiaries are subject to local regulations which generally prohibit repayment of borrowings from the Company or affiliates, paying cash dividends, making loans to the Company or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity’s principal regulator.\n4. Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table summarizes the valuation of the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value as categorized based on the hierarchy described in Note 2:\n75\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nSecurities classified within Level 2 were valued using a market approach utilizing prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable assets. The foreign currency forward contracts are classified within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted market prices. The mutual funds held in a rabbi trust represent investments associated with the Company’s deferred cash incentive plan. There were no financial assets classified within Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe table below presents the carrying value, fair value and fair value hierarchy category of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. The carrying values of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value categorized in the fair value hierarchy as Level 1 and Level 2 approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of the underlying assets and liabilities.\nThe Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the net investment in the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries. The Company designates each foreign currency forward contract as a hedge and assesses the risk management objective and strategy, including identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item and the risk exposure and how effectiveness is to be assessed prospectively and retrospectively. These hedges are for a\none-month\nperiod and are used to limit exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The fair value of the asset is included in prepaid expenses and other assets and the fair value of the liability is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nA summary of the foreign currency forward position is as follows:\n76\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThe following is a summary of the Company’s investments:\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the investments based upon the contractual maturities:\nProceeds from the sales and maturities of investments during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $\n261.6\nmillion, $\n262.1\nmillion and $\n409.3\nmillion, respectively. Net unrealized losses and gains on trading securities were $\n0.4\nmillion and $\n0.8\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2018. Net realized gains were $\n1.7\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020, and were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nThe following table provides fair values and unrealized losses on corporate debt investments and by the aging of the securities' continuous unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively:\n77\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n5. Receivables from and Payables to Broker-dealers, Clearing Organizations and Customers\nAs of December 31, 2020, receivables from and payables to broker-dealers, clearing organizations and customers consisted of the following:\n6. Acquisitions\nOn November 1, 2019, the Company and one of its subsidiaries completed their acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of LiquidityEdge LLC (“LiquidityEdge” and such acquisition the “LiquidityEdge Acquisition”) pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Unit Purchase Agreement entered into among the Company, LiquidityEdge, the holders of all the outstanding equity interests in LiquidityEdge and certain other persons named therein on August 12, 2019 (as amended, the “Agreement”). The aggregate consideration for the LiquidityEdge Acquisition was $\n153.2\nmillion, comprised of approximately $\n104.4\nmillion in cash and\n146,450\nshares of common stock of the Company (valued at approximately $\n48.8\nmillion as of the closing date of the LiquidityEdge Acquisition, as described below). A portion of the stock consideration, amounting to\n43,937\nshares of common stock, was placed in escrow for up to\n18\nmonths to secure the sellers’ indemnification obligations under the Agreement. In addition, under the Agreement, the sellers were prohibited from transferring any of the Company common stock received in the LiquidityEdge Acquisition for a period of\nsix months\nfollowing the November 1, 2019 closing date. The value ascribed to the shares by the Company was discounted from the market value on the date of closing to reflect the non-marketability of such shares during the restriction period.\nLiquidityEdge is a limited liability company organized in the state of Delaware and is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. LiquidityEdge offers an electronic trading platform for U.S. Treasuries.\nThe Company has completed an allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. The Company utilized an independent third-party to determine the fair value of the acquired intangible assets. The purchase price allocation is as follows (in thousands):\n78\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThe acquired intangible assets and useful lives are as follows ($ in thousands):\nOn November 30, 2020 the Company acquired Regulatory Services GmbH, the pan-European regulatory reporting business of\nDeutsche Börse Group. The purchase price consists of\n$\n22.5\nmillion in cash paid at closing and up to $\n24.6\nmillion in contingent consideration payable in cash within\n18\nmonths of the closing. The Company is accounting for the transaction as a purchase of assets and recorded $\n37.4\nmillion in amortizable intangible assets as of the acquisition date.\nIn September 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire MuniBrokers LLC, a central electronic venue serving municipal bond inter-dealer brokers and dealers. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nThe purchase price is approximately $\n45.0\nmillion in cash, plus transaction costs, with $\n20.0\nmillion paid at closing and up to $\n25.0\nmillion in contingent consideration payable within\nthree years\nof the closing.\n7\n. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives was $\n147.4\nand $\n146.9\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nIntangible assets that are subject to amortization, including the related accumulated amortization, are comprised of the following:\nAmortization expense associated with identifiable intangible assets was $\n3.9\nmillion, $\n0.8\nmillion and $\n0.4\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Annual estimated total amortization expense is $\n5.7\nmillion, $\n6.9\nmillion, $\n7.9\nmillion, $\n6.7\nmillion and $\n5.7\nmillion for 2021 through 2025.\n8. Capitalized Software, Furniture, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements\nCapitalized software development costs, furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, are comprised of the following:\n79\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, software development costs totaling $\n30.6\nmillion and $\n22.4\nmillion, respectively, were capitalized. Non-capitalized software costs and routine maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and are included in employee compensation and benefits and professional and consulting fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n9. Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following:\nPre-tax income from U.S. operations was $\n288.3\nmillion, $\n190.4\nmillion and $\n168.5\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Pre-tax income from foreign operations was $\n86.1\nmillion, $\n67.0\nmillion and $\n49.6\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe difference between the Company’s reported provision for income taxes and the U.S. federal statutory rate of\n21\n% is as follows:\n80\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThe following is a summary of the Company’s net deferred tax assets:\nThe Company or one of its subsidiaries files U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax returns. The Company is currently under a New York State income tax examination for tax years\n2010\nthrough\n2017\nand a New York City income tax examination for the tax years\n2016\nthrough\n2018\n. At this time, the Company cannot estimate when the examinations will conclude or the impact such examinations will have on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, if any. Generally, other than New York City and State, the Company is no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2017.\n81\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nA reconciliation of the unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $\n16.3\nmillion of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective tax rate. Due to the uncertainty related to the timing and potential outcome of audits, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit that could be adjusted in the next 12 months. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized $\n3.7\nmillion, $\n0.6\nmillion and $\n0.4\nmillion, respectively, in penalties and interest. The Company had $\n4.9\nmillion and $\n1.2\nmillion accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n10. Stockholders’ Equity\nCommon Stock\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had\n110,000,000\nauthorized shares of voting common stock and\n10,000,000\nauthorized shares of non-voting common stock. Voting common stock entitles the holder to\none\nvote per share of common stock held.\nThe following is a summary of the change in the Company’s outstanding shares of voting common stock:\nIn September 2017, the Board of Directors authorized a\nfifteen-month\nshare repurchase program for up to $\n100.0\nmillion that commenced in\nOctober 2017\n. The expiration date of this program was subsequently extended to March 31, 2019. In January 2019, the Board of Directors authorized a new\ntwo-year\nshare repurchase program for up to $\n100.0\nmillion, which commenced in\nApril 2019\nand expires in March 2021. In January 2021, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $\n100\nmillion. The Company expects repurchases under the new program to commence in\nApril 2021\nfollowing the expiration of the current plan. Shares repurchased under each program will be held in treasury for future use.\nDividends\nDuring 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company paid quarterly cash dividends of $\n0.60\nper share, $\n0.51\nper share and $\n0.42\nper share, respectively. Any future declaration and payment of dividends will be at the sole discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may take into account such matters as general business conditions, the Company’s financial results, capital requirements, contractual obligations, legal, and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends to the Company’s stockholders or by the Company’s subsidiaries to their respective parent entities, and any such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant.\n82\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n11. Stock-Based Compensation Plans\nThe Company maintains stock incentive plans which provide for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, or other stock-based awards as incentives and rewards to encourage employees, consultants and non-employee directors to participate in the long-term success of the Company. As of December 31, 2020, there were\n2,531,199\nshares available for grant under the stock incentive plans.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense was as follows:\nThe Company records stock-based compensation expense for employees in employee compensation and benefits and for non-employee directors in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nStock Options\nThe exercise price of each option granted is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Generally, option grants have provided for vesting over a\nthree or five-year\nperiod. Options generally expire in\nsix\nor\nten\nyears\nfrom the date of grant. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by the Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables, including the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield rate and the expected term. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity value approximating the expected term of the option. The dividend yield rate is based on the expected annual dividends to be paid divided by the expected stock price. The expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior.\nThe weighted-average fair value for options granted during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n91.43\n, $\n58.37\nand $\n56.11\n, respectively.\nThe following table represents the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the per share weighted-average fair value for options granted, excluding the\ntwo\nawards discussed below:\n83\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nIn addition to the option grants above,\n76,868\nstock options were granted to the Company’s President and Chief Operating Officer in January 2019 with an aggregate grant date fair value of $\n2.9\nmillion as determined by an independent third party using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The exercise price is $\n272.88\nfor\n35,679\nof the stock options and $\n294.71\nfor the remaining\n41,189\nstock options, which is equal to\n125\n% and\n135\n%, respectively, of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. Subject to the grantee’s continued service with the Company, the options will vest and become exercisable on\nJanuary 22, 2024\n. The options expire on\nJuly 22, 2024\n. Key assumptions used for the Monte Carlo model included a risk-free interest rate of\n2.6\n%, volatility of\n25.8\n% and a dividend yield of\n0.8\n%.\nIn November 2018,\n148,524\nstock options were granted to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer with a grant date fair value of $\n5.5\nmillion as determined by an independent third party using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The exercise price is $\n257.78\nfor\n69,113\nof the stock options and $\n278.40\nfor the remaining\n79,411\nstock options, which is equal to\n125\n% and\n135\n%, respectively, of the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the grant date. Subject to the grantee’s continued service with the Company, the options will vest and become exercisable on\nNovember 8, 2023\n. The options expire on\nMay 8, 2024\n. Key assumptions used for the Monte Carlo model included a risk-free interest rate of\n3.1\n%, volatility of\n25.9\n% and a dividend yield of\n0.8\n%.\nThe following table reports stock option activity during the three years ended December 31, 2020 and the intrinsic value as of December 31, 2020:\nThe intrinsic value is the amount by which the closing price of the Company’s common stock on December 31, 2020 of $\n570.56\nor the price on the day of exercise exceeds the exercise price of the stock options multiplied by the number of shares. As of December 31, 2020, there was $\n5.9\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n2.4\nyears.\n84\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nRestricted Stock and Performance Shares\nRestricted stock generally vests over a\nthree or five-year\nperiod. Compensation expense is measured at the grant date and recognized ratably over the vesting period.\nPrior to 2020, performance shares were generally granted with a performance period of one year, whereby each performance share award was earned or forfeited based on the level of achievement by the Company of pre-tax operating income, as defined in the year following the grant. The pay-out ranged from\nzero\nto\n150\n% of the performance share award. For each performance share earned, a participant was awarded an equal number of shares of restricted stock. Subject to the grantee’s continued service, any restricted stock awarded to a participant vested in two equal installments on each of the second and third anniversaries of the date of grant of the applicable performance share award. Compensation expense for one-year performance shares was measured at the grant date and recognized on a graded basis over the vesting period.\nThe following table reports performance share activity for the one-year performance awards for the two years ended December 31, 2019:\nBeginning in 2020, performance shares were granted with a\nthree-year\nperformance period, whereby each performance share award will be earned or forfeited based on the level of achievement by the Company of certain operating metrics over the three-year period following the grant. The pay-out will range from\nzero\nto\n150\n% of the performance share award. For each performance share earned, a participant is awarded an equal number of shares of restricted stock. Subject to the grantee’s continued service, any restricted stock awarded to a participant will vest on the three year anniversary of the grant date. Compensation expense for the three-year performance shares is measured at the grant date with performance target achievement assessed at the end of each reporting period. The grant date value of the number of shares deemed probable to vest is recognized ratably over the vesting period. A total of\n13,295\nperformance shares were awarded in January 2020 under the three-year program with a grant date fair value of $\n368.10\n. As of December 31, 2020,\n15,319\nshares have been deemed probable to vest.\nIn addition to the grants above,\n18,914\nperformance shares were granted to the Company’s President and Chief Operating Officer in January 2019 with an aggregate fair value of $\n2.9\nmillion as determined by an independent third party using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The performance share award provides that the number of shares earned will be based on the Company’s achievement of certain share price levels during the\nfive-year\nperformance period. The performance level is $\n272.88\nfor\n8,969\nof the performance shares and $\n294.71\nfor the remaining\n9,945\nperformance shares, which is equal to\n125\n% and\n135\n%, respectively, of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. Each of the performance levels have been achieved. Subject to the grantee’s continued service with the Company, earned shares will vest on\nJanuary 22, 2024\n. Key assumptions used for the Monte Carlo simulation included a risk-free interest rate of\n2.6\n%, volatility of\n25.9\n% and a dividend yield of\n0.8\n%.\nIn November 2018,\n37,742\nperformance shares were granted to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer with a grant date fair value of $\n5.5\nmillion as determined by an independent third party using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The performance share award provides that the number of shares earned will be based on the Company’s achievement of certain share price levels during the\nfive-year\nperformance period. The performance level is $\n257.78\nfor\n17,942\nof the performance shares and $\n278.40\nfor the remaining\n19,800\nperformance shares, which is equal to\n125\n% and\n135\n%, respectively, of the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the grant date. Each of the performance levels have been achieved. Subject to the grantee’s continued service with the Company, earned shares will vest on\nNovember 8, 2023\n. Key assumptions used for the Monte Carlo model included a risk-free interest rate of\n3.1\n%, volatility of\n26.1\n% and a dividend yield of\n0.8\n%.\n85\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nThe following table reports restricted stock and performance share activity during the three years ended December 31, 2020:\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was $\n27.0\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock and performance shares. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.5\nyears.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company offers a non-qualified employee stock purchase plan for non-executive employees. Under the plan, participants are granted the right to purchase shares of common stock based on the fair market value on the last day of the six-month offering period. On the purchase date, the Company grants to the participants a number of shares of common stock equal to\n20\n% of the aggregate shares purchased by the participant. These matching shares vest over a\none-year\nperiod. The Company issued\n729\n,\n617\nand\n989\nmatching shares in connection with the plan for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n12. Earnings Per Share\nThe following table sets forth basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding used to compute earnings per share:\n86\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\nStock options and restricted stock totaling\n21,127\nshares,\n146,822\nshares and\n83,718\nshares for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been antidilutive. The computation of diluted shares can vary among periods due, in part, to the change in the average price of the Company’s common stock.\n13. Credit Agreements\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nIn October 2015, the Company entered into a\ntwo-year\namended and restated credit agreement (the “Prior Credit Agreement”) that provided for revolving loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of $\n100.0\nmillion. The maturity date of the Prior Credit Agreement was subsequently extended to\nNovember 2020\n. On August 19, 2020, the Company amended the Prior Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) permit investments of up to $\n500\nmillion in MarketAxess Corporation and (ii) increase the aggregate commitments of the lender under the Credit Agreement from $\n100\nmillion to $\n450\nmillion. The Prior Credit Agreement matured on November 13, 2020, when the Company entered into a new\none-year\ncredit agreement. Borrowings under the Prior Credit Agreement bore interest at a rate per annum equal to the base rate or adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin that varied with the Company’s consolidated total leverage ratio.\nIn November 2020, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, that provides aggregate commitments totaling $\n500\nmillion, consisting of a revolving credit facility and a $\n5\nmillion letter of credit sub-limit for standby letters of credit. The Credit Agreement replaced the Prior Credit Agreement and will mature on\nNovember 12, 2021\n, with the Company’s option to request up to\ntwo\nadditional\n364\n-day extensions at the discretion of each lender and subject to customary conditions.\nSubject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions, the Company is permitted to upsize the Credit Agreement by up to $\n250\nmillion in total.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $\n1.0\nmillion in letters of credit outstanding and $\n499.0\nmillion in available borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum\nequal to the base rate or adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin that varies with the Company’s consolidated total leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement requires that the Company satisfy certain covenants, which include leverage ratios and minimum earnings before interest, tax, and depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) requirements. The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants at December 31, 2020. The Company incurred an aggregate of $\n0.8\nmillion of interest expense on borrowings under the Credit Agreement and the Prior Credit Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCollateralized Agreement\nIn connection with its self-clearing operations, one of the Company’s broker-dealer subsidiaries entered into an agreement (the “Collateralized Agreement”) with its settlement bank to provide loans to the subsidiary in amounts up to an aggregate of $\n200.0\nmillion on an uncommitted basis. Borrowings under the Collateralized Agreement are collateralized by securities pledged by the Company’s broker-dealer subsidiary to the settlement bank, subject to applicable haircuts and concentration limits. Borrowings under the Collateralized Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate plus\n1.00\n%. The Company incurred $\n0.1\nmillion of interest expense on borrowings under the Collateralized Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had\nno\nborrowings outstanding and $\n200.0\nmillion in available borrowing capacity under the Collateralized Agreement.\n87\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n14. Leases\nThe Company has operating leases for corporate offices with initial lease terms ranging from\none-year\nto\n15\nyears.\nCertain leases contain options to extend the initial term at the Company’s discretion\n. The Company accounts for the option to extend when it is reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, restrictions or covenants.\nThe following table presents the components of occupancy expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is, or includes, a lease at contract inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date and are initially measured based on the present value of lease payments over the defined lease term. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company used its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nThe weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate are as follows:\nThe following table presents the maturity of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020:\nThe Company has entered into agreements to sublease or assign the Company’s lease obligations on\ntwo\nproperties to third parties and is contingently liable should the third parties default on future lease obligations through the lease termination dates of\nFebruary 2022\nand\nMay 2022\n. The aggregate amount of the future lease obligations under these arrangements is $\n2.1\nmillion as of December 31, 2020.\n88\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n15. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal\nIn the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements may be involved in various lawsuits, proceedings and regulatory examinations. The Company assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings, if any, utilizing the latest information available. For matters where it is probable that the Company will incur a material loss and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company would establish an accrual for the loss. Once established, the accrual would be adjusted to reflect any relevant developments. When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual.\nBased on currently available information, the outcome of the Company’s outstanding matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position. It is not presently possible to determine the ultimate exposure to these matters and there is no assurance that the resolution of the outstanding matters will not significantly exceed any reserves accrued by the Company.\nOther\nThe Company, through certain of its subsidiaries, executes bond transactions between its institutional investor and broker-dealer clients on a matched principal basis by serving as counterparty to both the buyer and the seller in trades. In August 2020, one of the Company’s U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries converted to a self-clearing model for the settlement of such transactions. The Company’s other U.S. and U.K subsidiaries continue to settle their transactions through third-party clearing brokers. Settlement typically occurs\nwithin one to two trading days\nafter the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. Under both the self-clearing and the third-party clearing broker models, the Company is exposed to credit risk in the event a counterparty does not fulfill its obligation to complete a transaction or if there is a miscommunication or other error in executing a matched principal transaction. Pursuant to the terms of the securities clearing agreements, each third-party clearing broker has the right to charge the Company for any losses they suffer resulting from a counterparty’s failure on any of the Company’s trades. The Company did not record any liabilities or losses with regard to counterparty failures for the three years ended December 31, 2020.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts that contain a variety of representations, warranties and general indemnifications. The Company’s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Company that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be remote.\n16. Segment and Geographic Information\nThe Company operates an electronic multi-party platform for the trading of fixed-income securities and provides related data, analytics, compliance tools and post-trade services. The Company’s operations constitute a\nsingle\nbusiness segment because of the highly integrated nature of these products and services, of the financial markets in which the Company competes and of the Company’s worldwide business activities. The Company believes that results by geographic region or client sector are not necessarily meaningful in understanding its business.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the U.K. was the only individual foreign country in which the Company had a subsidiary that accounted for\n10\n% or more of the total revenues or total long-lived assets. Revenues and long-lived assets are attributed to geographic area based on the location of the particular subsidiary. Long-lived assets are defined as furniture, equipment, leasehold improvements and capitalized software.\nRevenues for the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and long-lived assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n89\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n17. Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans\nThe Company, through its U.S. and U.K. subsidiaries, offers its employees the opportunity to invest in defined contribution plans. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company contributed $\n4.0\nmillion, $\n3.3\nmillion and $\n2.6\nmillion, respectively, to the plans.\nThe Company offers a non-qualified deferred cash incentive plan to certain officers and other employees. Under the plan, eligible employees may defer up to\n100\n% of their annual cash incentive pay. The Company has elected to fund its deferred compensation obligations through a rabbi trust. The rabbi trust is subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency but such assets are not available for general corporate purposes. Assets held in the rabbi trust are invested in mutual funds, as selected by the participants, which are designated as trading securities and carried at fair value. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of the mutual fund investments and deferred compensation obligations were $\n8.9\nmillion and $\n6.2\nmillion, respectively. Changes in the fair value of securities held in the rabbi trust and offsetting increases or decreases in the deferred compensation obligation are recognized in other, net in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n18. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents together with restricted or segregated cash as reported within the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition to the sum of the same such amounts shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\n19. Parent Company Information\nThe following tables present Parent Company–only financial information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company.\n90\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n91\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n92\nMARKETAXESS HOLDINGS INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n93"
