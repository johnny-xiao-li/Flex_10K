    "text": "GENERAL\nState Street Corporation, referred to as the Parent Company, is a financial holding company organized in 1969 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Our executive offices are located at One Lincoln Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02111 (telephone (617) 786-3000). For purposes of this Form 10-K, unless the context requires otherwise, references to “State Street,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar terms mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The Parent Company is a source of financial and managerial strength to our subsidiaries. Through our subsidiaries, including our principal banking subsidiary, State Street Bank and Trust Company, referred to as State Street Bank, we provide a broad range of financial products and services to institutional investors worldwide, with $38.79 trillion of AUC/A and $3.47 trillion of AUM as of December 31, 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had consolidated total assets of $314.71 billion, consolidated total deposits of $239.80 billion, consolidated total shareholders' equity of $26.20 billion and over 39,000 employees. We operate in more than 100 geographic markets worldwide, including the U.S., Canada, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.\nOn the “Investor Relations” section of our corporate website at\nwww.statestreet.com\n, we make available, free of charge, all reports we electronically file with, or furnish to, the SEC including our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after those documents have been filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. These documents are also accessible on the SEC’s website at\nwww.sec.gov\n. We have included the website addresses of State Street and the SEC in this report as inactive textual references only. Information on those websites is not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.\nWe have Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as written charters for the Examining and Audit\nCommittee, the Executive Committee, the Human Resources Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Risk Committee and the Technology and Operations Committee of our Board of Directors, or Board, and a Code of Ethics for senior financial officers, a Standard of Conduct for Directors and a Standard of Conduct for our employees. Each of these documents is posted on the \"Investor Relations\" section of our website under \"Corporate Governance.\"\nWe provide additional disclosures required by applicable bank regulatory standards, including supplemental qualitative and quantitative information with respect to regulatory capital (including market risk associated with our trading activities) and the liquidity coverage ratio, summary results of State Street-run stress tests which we conduct under the Dodd-Frank Act and resolution plan disclosures required under the Dodd-Frank Act. These additional disclosures are available on the “Investor Relations” section of our website under \"Filings and Reports.\"\nWe use acronyms and other defined terms for certain business terms and abbreviations, as defined on the acronyms list and glossary under Item 8 in this Form 10-K.\nBUSINESS DESCRIPTION\nOverview\nWe conduct our business primarily through State Street Bank, which traces its beginnings to the founding of the Union Bank in 1792. State Street Bank's current charter was authorized by a special Act of the Massachusetts Legislature in 1891, and its present name was adopted in 1960. State Street Bank operates as a specialized bank, referred to as a trust or custody bank, that services and manages assets on behalf of its institutional clients.\nOur clients include mutual funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments and investment managers.\nLINES OF BUSINESS\nWe have two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management.\nInvestment Servicing\nOur Investment Servicing line of business performs core custody and related value-added functions, such as providing institutional investors with clearing, settlement and payment services. Our financial services and products allow our large institutional investor clients to execute financial transactions on a daily basis in markets across the globe. As most institutional investors cannot economically or efficiently build their own technology and operational processes necessary to facilitate their global securities settlement needs, our role as a\nState Street Corporation | 6\nglobal trust and custody bank is generally to aid our clients to efficiently perform services associated with the clearing, settlement and execution of securities transactions and related payments.\nOur Investment Servicing products and services include: custody; product accounting; daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; depotbank services (a fund oversight role created by non-U.S. regulation); record-keeping; cash management; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services;  securities finance and enhanced custody products; deposit and short-term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance analytics; and financial data management to support institutional investors.\nIncluded within our Investment Servicing line of business is Charles River Systems, Inc. (CRD), which we acquired in October 2018. The Charles River Investment Management solution is a technology offering which is designed to automate and simplify the institutional investment process across asset classes, from portfolio management and risk analytics through trading and post-trade settlement, with integrated compliance and managed data throughout. With the acquisition of CRD, we took the first step in building our front-to-back platform, State Street AlphaSM (State Street Alpha). Today, our State Street Alpha platform combines portfolio management, trading and execution, advanced data aggregation, analytics and compliance tools, and integration with other industry platforms and providers.\nWe provide some or all of the Investment Servicing integrated products and services to clients in the U.S. and in many other markets, including, among others, Australia, Cayman Islands, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, South Korea and the U.K. As of December 31, 2020, we serviced AUC/A of approximately $28.25 trillion in the Americas, approximately $8.10 trillion in Europe and the Middle East and approximately $2.45 trillion in the Asia-Pacific region\n1\n.\nInvestment Management\nOur Investment Management line of business\n,\nthrough State Street Global Advisors, provides a broad range of investment management strategies and products for our clients. Our investment management strategies and products span the risk/reward spectrum for equity, fixed income and cash assets, including core and enhanced indexing, multi-asset strategies, active quantitative and fundamental active capabilities and alternative investment strategies. Our AUM is currently primarily weighted to indexed strategies. In addition, we provide a breadth\nof services and solutions, including environmental, social and governance investing, defined benefit and defined contribution and Global Fiduciary Solutions (formerly Outsourced Chief Investment Officer). State Street Global Advisors is also a provider of ETFs, including the SPDR\n®\nETF brand. While management fees are primarily determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, State Street Global Advisors had AUM of approximately $3.47 trillion.\nAdditional information about our lines of business is provided under “Line of Business Information” included in our Management's Discussion and Analysis, and in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Additional information about our non-U.S. activities is included in Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nCOMPETITION\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment in all areas of our business globally. Our competitors include a broad range of financial institutions and servicing companies, including other custodial banks, deposit-taking institutions, investment management firms, insurance companies, mutual funds, broker/dealers, investment banks, benefits consultants, investment analytics businesses, business service and software companies and information services firms. As our businesses grow and markets evolve, we may encounter increasing and new forms of competition around the world.\nWe believe that many key factors drive competition in the markets for our business. Technological expertise, economies of scale, required levels of capital, pricing, quality and scope of services, and sales and marketing are critical to our Investment Servicing line of business. For our Investment Management line of business, key competitive factors include expertise, experience, availability of related service offerings, quality of service, price, efficiency of our products and services, and performance.\nOur competitive success may depend on our ability to develop and market new and innovative services, to adopt or develop new technologies, to implement efficiencies into our operational processes, to bring new services to market in a timely fashion at competitive prices, to integrate existing and future products and services effectively into State Street Alpha, to continue to expand our relationships with existing clients, and to attract new clients.\nWe are a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) and are subject to extensive\n1\nGeographic mix is generally based on the domicile of the entity servicing the funds and is not necessarily representative of the underlying asset mix.\nState Street Corporation | 7\nregulation and supervision with respect to our operations and activities. Not all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or financial holding company, and therefore some of our competitors may not be subject to the same limitations, requirements and standards with respect to their operations and activities. Most other financial institutions designated as systemically important have substantially greater financial resources and a broader base of operations than we do and are, consequently, in a better competitive position to manage and bear the costs of this enhanced regulatory requirement. See \"Supervision and Regulation\" in this Item for more information.\nHUMAN RESOURCES\nOur employees are a core asset and a key driver of our long-term performance. Our employees drive the company’s value proposition, innovate better ways to serve our clients and act as custodians of our reputation. We seek to empower our employees by providing development and learning opportunities to keep our personnel engaged and help our teams reach their full potential, by promoting an inclusive and diverse workplace and by improving productivity and efficiency. We first measure our executives’ business and technical performance, and then may further adjust their compensation, based on their risk performance and their performance against critical leadership behaviors and culture traits that align with our human capital management strategy.\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on how we managed our human capital. Nearly all of our workforce began working remotely, reaching approximately 90% in April 2020, and we instituted safety protocols and procedures for the essential employees who returned to work on site. During this period of uncertainty for our employees, we committed in the first quarter of 2020 that no workforce reductions would occur in 2020, other than for performance or conduct reasons. Due to the net impact of hiring and attrition levels, both of which we monitor closely, our workforce at the end of 2020 was up 1% compared to 2019 at approximately 39,000 employees, 67% of whom are located outside the U.S. Moreover, approximately 90% of responding employees indicated during an all-employee survey that they were proud of the way the company is responding to the crisis.\nReflecting the key role of human capital in our business strategy, in 2020, we renamed the Board of Directors’ Executive Compensation Committee as the Human Resources Committee and highlighted in its charter the Committee’s oversight responsibilities for human capital management, including recruitment, retention and inclusion and diversity initiatives. We also established the Enterprise Talent Management Committee, a management-level committee, consisting of senior leaders of our organization, which\noversees our global business activities. The Enterprise Talent Management Committee provides leadership, input and advisory oversight for all aspects of our global talent related initiatives that support achievement of our strategic priority to become a high-performing organization.\nOur Culture and Values\nOur culture and values help to define us as a company and are embodied in the following culture traits we expect of our employees:\n•\nChoose to Own It;\n•\nBreak Through Silos;\n•\nDeliver Results with Integrity and Speed;\n•\nDo Better Every Day; and\n•\nCare for Our Colleagues, Clients and Community.\nWe believe that an inclusive and diverse culture where all employees feel valued and engaged makes State Street a desirable place to work, helps us to attract key talent and retain employees as they grow in their careers and fosters an environment that enhances each individual’s productivity and professional satisfaction.\nThe integrity and ethical decision-making of our employees is also paramount for our culture. We encourage employees to speak up if they see behavior that is inconsistent with our Standard of Conduct and values, and we provide multiple channels for them to do so. Our goal is to promote ethical conduct by treating minor policy breaches as learning opportunities, with major policy breaches and misconduct treated promptly, professionally, and seriously.\nCompensation Philosophy\nOur overall aim with respect to compensation is to reward and motivate high-performing employees and to provide competitive incentive opportunities, encouraging employees to learn and grow in their careers. Compensation is typically comprised of fixed compensation, which reflects individual skills and abilities relative to role requirements, and variable compensation, which is designed to link total compensation opportunities to organizational, business line, risk management and individual performance. Our compensation program is intended to drive our business strategy by differentiating pay based on performance against annual objectives.\nDevelopment and Learning\nProfessional development and employee learning are key elements of our talent retention strategy. We seek to align our learning and development programs with our long-term strategy by offering skills enhancement targeting the rapidly changing, technology-centric demands of the financial services industry to our workforce. We also provide\nState Street Corporation | 8\ntargeted professional development opportunities and new roles for key talent, which we believe helps to deepen our employees’ skillsets and provides them with a broader perspective on the organization. To help leverage our internal talent, we launched an internal talent marketplace during 2020. The talent marketplace is an innovative way for employees to access new roles, skills, and opportunities, and for managers to recruit internal talent. By broadening every employee’s access to roles and by showing managers the full breadth of talent at State Street, our goal is to provide better pathways to long-term success for all employees.\nInclusion and Diversity\nWhile inclusion and diversity have long been a focus for our company, we are working to accelerate progress against our racial/ethnic diversity goals and build more equity through all of our talent processes and within our communities via “10 Actions Against Racism and Inequality,” which we announced in July 2020. These concrete actions are intended to address racial and social injustice by improving inclusion and diversity within our own organization and advocating for the same in our industry. While we have taken many steps to address inequality and racism in our organization, in our communities, and through our asset stewardship program, we have more work to do. This includes our plan to increase the representation, development, and advancement of Black and Latinx employees and working with our Board of Directors to add Black and Latinx directors by 2022. More details on the “10 Actions” are available on our website.\nAt the end of 2020, our global workforce was 54.5% male and 45.2% female, and women represented 30.1% of our leadership (defined as senior vice president level and above). In the U.S., 30% of our workforce self-identified as employees of color. We also publish our demographic data in our EEO-1 report, which is included in our Corporate Responsibility Report (renamed as our ‘Environmental, Social and Governance Report’ for 2020), and can be found in the Values section of our website.\nOrganizational Effectiveness\nDriving improvements in both individual and organizational productivity is a key ongoing focus of our overall human capital management strategy. We seek to enhance the value each employee is able to contribute by investing in new technologies, designing more effective organizational structures, improving processes and operating models, optimizing our global footprint, and aligning incentives to outcomes. We believe that improving the productivity of our workforce will yield more engaged and higher performing employees and better products and services for our clients.\nAdditional Information\nAdditional information on our human capital management strategy, including detailed demographic data, will be contained in our 2020 Environmental, Social and Governance Report, which we expect to make available on our website by April 30, 2021.\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\nWe are registered with the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The Bank Holding Company Act generally limits the activities in which bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries may engage to managing or controlling banks and to a range of activities that are considered to be closely related to banking. Bank holding companies that have elected to be treated as financial holding companies, such as the Parent Company, may engage in a broader range of activities considered to be \"financial in nature.\" The regulatory limits on our activities also apply to non-banking entities that we are deemed to “control” for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act, which may include companies of which we own or control 5% or more of a class of voting shares. The Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company to terminate any activity, or its ownership or control of a non-banking subsidiary, if the Federal Reserve finds that the activity, ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of a banking subsidiary or is inconsistent with sound banking principles or statutory purposes. The Bank Holding Company Act also requires a bank holding company to obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve before it acquires substantially all the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank.\nThe Parent Company has elected to be treated as a financial holding company and, as such, may engage in a broader range of non-banking activities than permitted for bank holding companies and their subsidiaries that have not elected to become financial holding companies. Financial holding companies may engage directly or indirectly, either de novo or by acquisition, in activities that are defined by the Federal Reserve to be financial in nature, provided that the financial holding company gives the Federal Reserve after-the-fact notice of the new activities. Activities defined to be financial in nature include, but are not limited to: providing financial or investment advice; underwriting; dealing in or making markets in securities; making merchant banking investments, subject to significant limitations; and any activities previously found by the Federal Reserve to be closely related to banking. In order to maintain our status as a financial holding company, we and each of our U.S. depository institution subsidiaries are expected to be well capitalized and well managed, as defined in applicable regulations and determined in part by the\nState Street Corporation | 9\nresults of regulatory examinations, and must comply with Community Reinvestment Act obligations. Failure to maintain these standards may result in restrictions on our activities and may ultimately permit the Federal Reserve to take enforcement actions against us and restrict our ability to engage in activities defined to be financial in nature. Currently, under the Bank Holding Company Act, we may not be able to engage in new activities or acquire shares or control of other businesses.\nIn response to the 2008 financial crisis, as well as other factors, such as technological and market changes, both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which our business is subject has increased. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations, most of which are now in place. Subsequently, in May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA) was enacted. The EGRRCPA’s revisions to the U.S. financial regulatory framework have altered certain laws and regulations applicable to us and other major financial services firms. Irrespective of any regulatory change, we expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision.\nIn addition, increased regulatory requirements and initiatives have been and are being implemented internationally with respect to financial institutions, including the implementation of the Basel III rule (refer to “Regulatory Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards” in this “Supervision and Regulation” section and under \"Capital\" in “Financial Condition” in our Management's Discussion and Analysis in this Form 10-K for a discussion of Basel III), the European Commission’s Investment Firm Review and Central Securities Depositories Regulation, as well as upcoming proposals for a review of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and proposals under the Capital Markets Union Action Plan.\nMany aspects of our business are subject to regulation by other U.S. federal and state governmental and regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations (including securities exchanges), and by non-U.S. governmental and regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations. Some aspects of our public disclosure, corporate governance principles and internal control systems are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations and rules of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange.\nRegulatory Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards\nBasel III Rule\nWe, as an advanced approaches banking organization, are subject to the Basel III framework in\nthe U.S. The provisions of the Basel III rule related to minimum capital requirements, regulatory capital buffers and deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital were fully implemented as of January 1, 2019. We are also subject to the market risk capital rule jointly issued by U.S. banking regulators to implement the changes to the market risk capital framework in the U.S.\nAs required by the Dodd-Frank Act, we, as an advanced approaches banking organization, are subject to a \"capital floor,\" also referred to as the Collins Amendment, in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy, including the capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer described below in this \"Supervision and Regulation\" section. Our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches.\nRisk Weighted Assets\nThe Basel III rule provides for two frameworks for the calculation of RWA for purposes of bank regulatory compliance: the “standardized” approach and the “advanced” approaches, which are applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations, like us.\nThe standardized approach prescribes standardized risk weights for certain on- and off-balance sheet exposures in the calculation of RWA. The advanced approaches consist of the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based Approach (AIRB) used for the calculation of RWA related to credit risk and the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) used for the calculation of RWA related to operational risk.\nIn November 2019, the Federal Reserve and the other U.S. federal banking agencies (U.S. Agencies)  issued a final rule that, among other things, implements the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR), a new methodology for calculating the exposure amount for derivative contracts. Under the final rule, which becomes effective on January 1, 2022, we will have the option to use the SA-CCR or the Internal Model Methodology (IMM) to measure the exposure amount of our cleared and uncleared derivative transactions under our advanced approaches calculation. We will be required to determine the amount of these exposures using the SA-CCR under our standardized approach capital calculation. Due to the nature of our trading activities, the impact of the final rule may have a greater proportional impact on our RWA than on some of our G-SIB peers. In addition, under the final rule we will be required to use a simplified formula to determine the RWA amount of our central counterparty default fund contributions.\nState Street Corporation | 10\nMinimum Risk-Based Capital Requirements\nAmong other things, the Basel III rule (as amended) requires:\n•\na minimum CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% and a minimum SLR of 3% for advanced approaches banking organizations;\n•\na minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%;\n•\na minimum total capital ratio of 8%; and\n•\nthe stress capital and countercyclical capital buffers, referenced below, as well as a G-SIB surcharge and the enhanced SLR (which acts as an SLR buffer) described in \"Capital\" in \"Financial Condition\" in our Management's Discussion and Analysis in this Form 10-K.\nUnder the Basel III rule, our total regulatory capital is composed of three tiers: CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital (which includes CET1 capital), and Tier 2 capital. The total of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, adjusted as applicable, is referred to as total regulatory capital.\nCET1 capital is composed of core capital elements, such as qualifying common shareholders' equity and related surplus plus retained earnings and the cumulative effect of foreign currency translation plus net unrealized gains (losses) on debt and equity securities classified as AFS, less treasury stock and less goodwill and other intangible assets, net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tier 1 capital is composed of CET1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital instruments which, for us, includes four series of preferred equity outstanding as of December 31, 2020. Tier 2 capital includes certain eligible subordinated long-term debt instruments. Total regulatory capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.\nCertain other items, if applicable, must be deducted from Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, including certain investments in the capital of unconsolidated banking, financial and insurance entities and the amount of expected credit losses that exceeds recorded allowances for loan and other credit losses. Expected credit losses are calculated for wholesale credit exposures by formula in conformity with the Basel III rule.\nG-SIB Surcharge\nThe eight U.S. bank holding companies deemed to be G-SIBs, including us, are required to calculate the G-SIB surcharge annually according to two methods, and be bound by the higher of the two:\n•\nMethod 1: Assesses systemic importance based upon five equally-weighted components: size, interconnectedness, complexity, cross-jurisdictional activity and substitutability; or\n•\nMethod 2: Alters the calculation from Method 1 by factoring in a short-term wholesale funding score in place of substitutability and applying a 2x multiplier to the sum of the five components.\nMethod 2 is the binding methodology for us as of December 31, 2020, and our applicable surcharge for 2021 was calculated to be 1.0% based on a calculation date of December 31, 2019.\nStress Capital Buffer\nOn March 4, 2020, the U.S. Agencies issued the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) final rule that replaces, under the standardized approach, the capital conservation buffer (2.5%) with an SCB calculated as the difference between the institution’s starting and lowest projected CET1 ratio under the CCAR severely adverse scenario plus planned common stock dividend payments (as a percentage of RWA) from the fourth through seventh quarter of the CCAR planning horizon. The SCB requirement, which became effective October 1, 2020, can be no less than 2.5% of RWA. On June 25, 2020, we were notified by the Federal Reserve of our preliminary SCB at the minimum of 2.5% for the period of October 1, 2020 through September 30, 2021, which was later finalized on August 10, 2020.  For additional information about the SCB final rule, refer to “Capital Planning, Stress Tests and Dividends” in this \"Supervision and Regulation\" section.\nUnder the SCB final rule, a banking organization would be able to make capital distributions (subject to other regulatory constraints, such as regulatory review of its capital plans) and discretionary bonus payments without specified limitations, as long as it maintains the required capital conservation buffer of 2.5% plus the applicable G-SIB surcharge (plus any potentially applicable countercyclical capital buffer) over the minimum required risk-based capital ratios and leverage based requirements. From time to time, under certain economic conditions, banking regulators may establish a minimum countercyclical capital buffer up to a maximum of 2.5% of total RWA. The countercyclical capital buffer was initially set by banking regulators at zero, and has not been increased since its inception.\nAssuming a countercyclical buffer of 0%, the minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2021, including a capital conservation buffer and an SCB of 2.5% for advanced and standardized approaches, respectively, and a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0%, are 8.0% for CET1 capital, 9.5% for Tier 1 risk-based capital and 11.5% for total risk-based capital, in order for us to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments without limitation.\nState Street Corporation | 11\nLeverage Ratios\nWe are subject to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and a supplementary leverage ratio. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and adjusted quarterly average on-balance sheet assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio differs from the SLR primarily in that the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio is a quarterly average of on-balance sheet assets, while the SLR additionally includes off-balance sheet exposures. We must maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.\nWe are also subject to a minimum SLR of 3%, and as a U.S. G-SIB, we must maintain a 2% SLR buffer in order to avoid any limitations on distributions to shareholders and discretionary bonus payments to certain executives. If we do not maintain this buffer, limitations on these distributions and discretionary bonus payments would be increasingly stringent based upon the extent of the shortfall.\nIn November 2019, pursuant to the EGRRCPA, the U.S. Agencies adopted a final rule that establishes a deduction for central bank deposits from a custodial banking organization’s total leverage exposure for purpose of calculating the SLR and which is not applicable to total leverage exposure under the calculation of Tier 1 leverage. This deduction is equal to the lesser of (i) the total amount of funds the custodial banking organization and its consolidated subsidiaries have on deposit at qualifying central banks and (ii) the total amount of client funds on deposit at the custodial banking organization that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts. The rule became effective on April 1, 2020. For the quarter ended December 31, 2020, we excluded $76.7 billion of average balances\nheld on deposit at central banks from the  denominator used in the calculation of our SLR based on this custodial banking exclusion. The TLAC and LTD that State Street is required to hold under SLR-based requirements reflect the exclusion of certain central bank balances as a consequence of the rule.\nIn addition, on May 15, 2020, the U.S. banking regulators issued an interim final rule temporarily permitting, until March 31, 2021, banking organizations to exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation of the SLR denominator. While we already receive the benefit of excluding central bank deposits pursuant to the final rule implementing the EGRRCPA, we have further excluded U.S. Treasury securities, in the amount of $13.60 billion of average balances pursuant to this temporary relief. See \"Subsidiaries\" in this section for further discussion of the impact of the final rule on State Street Bank.\nThe SA-CCR final rule adopted in November 2019, which becomes effective on January 1, 2022, also requires us to incorporate the SA-CCR into the calculation of our total leverage exposure for the purpose of calculating SLR.\nOn April 11, 2018, the Federal Reserve proposed modifications to the SLR that would replace the current 2% SLR buffer applicable to us with an SLR buffer equal to 50% of our applicable G-SIB capital surcharge. The Federal Reserve has not finalized these proposed modifications.\nState Street Corporation | 12\nSelected Recent Regulatory Developments Summary\nState Street Corporation | 13\nAs a systemically important financial institution, we are subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards. Our status as a G-SIB has also resulted in heightened prudential and conduct expectations of our U.S. and international regulators with respect to our capital and liquidity management and our compliance and risk oversight programs. These heightened expectations have increased our regulatory compliance costs, including personnel, technology and systems, as well as significant additional implementation and related costs to enhance our regulatory compliance programs. Regulatory compliance requirements are anticipated to remain at least at the elevated levels we have experienced over the past several years.\nFailure to meet current and future regulatory capital requirements could subject us to a variety of enforcement actions, including the termination of State Street Bank's deposit insurance by the FDIC, and to certain restrictions on our business, including those that are described above in this “Supervision and Regulation” section.\nNot all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or financial holding company, and therefore some of our competitors may not be subject to the same additional capital requirements.\nFor additional information about our regulatory capital position and our regulatory capital adequacy, as well as current and future regulatory capital requirements, refer to \"Capital\" in “Financial Condition\" in our Management's Discussion and Analysis, and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity\nIn 2016, the Federal Reserve released its final rule on TLAC, LTD and clean holding company requirements for U.S. domiciled G-SIBs, such as us. The requirements are intended to improve the resiliency and resolvability of certain U.S. banking organizations through enhanced prudential standards. The TLAC rule imposes: (1) external TLAC requirements (i.e., combined eligible Tier 1 regulatory capital and LTD); (2) separate external LTD requirements; and (3) clean holding company requirements that impose restrictions on certain types of liabilities and limit non-TLAC related third party liabilities to 5% of external TLAC.\nAmong other things, the TLAC rule required us to comply with minimum requirements for external TLAC and external LTD effective January 1, 2019. Specifically, as of January 2021, we must hold\n(1) combined eligible Tier 1 regulatory capital and LTD in the amount equal to the greater of 21.5% of total RWA (18.0% minimum plus a 2.5% capital conservation\nbuffer plus a G-SIB surcharge calculated for these purposes under Method 1 of 1.0% plus any applicable counter-cyclical buffer, which is currently 0%) and 9.5% of total leverage exposure (7.5% minimum plus the enhanced SLR buffer of 2.0%), as defined by the SLR rule; and\n(2) qualifying external LTD equal to the greater of 7.0% of RWA (6.0% minimum plus a G-SIB surcharge calculated for these purposes under method 2 of 1.0%) and 4.5% of total leverage exposure, as defined by the SLR rule.\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio\nIn addition to capital standards, the Basel III framework introduced two quantitative liquidity standards: the LCR and the NSFR.\nWe are subject to the rule issued by the U.S. Agencies implementing the BCBS LCR in the U.S. The LCR is intended to promote the short-term resilience of internationally active banking organizations, like us, to improve the banking industry's ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress over a 30 calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk.\nThe LCR measures an institution’s HQLA against its net cash outflows under a prescribed stress environment. We report LCR to the Federal Reserve daily and are required to calculate and maintain an LCR that is equal to or greater than 100%. In addition, we publicly disclose certain qualitative and quantitative information about our LCR consistent with the requirements of the Federal Reserve's final rule.\nCompliance with the LCR has required that we maintain an investment portfolio that contains an adequate amount of HQLA. In general, HQLA investments generate a lower investment return than other types of investments, resulting in a negative impact on our NII and our NIM. In addition, the level of HQLA we are required to maintain under the LCR is dependent upon our client relationships and the nature of services we provide, which may change over time. Deposits resulting from certain services provided (“operational deposits”) are treated as more resilient during periods of stress than other deposits. As a result, if balances of operational deposits increased relative to our total client deposit base, we would expect to require less HQLA in order to maintain our LCR. Conversely, if balances of operational deposits decreased relative to our total client deposit base, we would expect to require more HQLA. On May 5, 2020, the U.S. banking agencies issued a rule that modifies the LCR rule to neutralize the impact on LCR of the advances made by the\nState Street Corporation | 14\nMMLF (and Paycheck Protection Liquidity Facility) and the exposures securing such advances.\nIn October 2020, the U.S. Agencies issued a final rule implementing the BCBS’s NSFR in the United States. The final rule requires large banking organizations to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is a weighted measure of a company’s funding sources over a one-year time horizon, calculated by applying standardized weightings to the company’s equity and liabilities based on their expected stability, that is no less than the amount of required stable funding, which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets, derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics. As a U.S. G-SIB, we will be required to maintain an NSFR that is equal to or greater than 100%. The final rule will become effective as of July 1, 2021. The final rule will also require us to publicly disclose our quarterly NSFR on a semiannual basis beginning in 2023.\nCapital Planning, Stress Tests and Dividends\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large bank holding companies, including us, which form part of the Federal Reserve’s annual CCAR framework. The Federal Reserve conducts its own stress tests of our business operations using supervisory models, the results of which it uses to calibrate our annual SCB, subject to a minimum of 2.5%. In addition, under the Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule, we must conduct periodic stress testing of our business operations and submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by us and by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve conducts a qualitative assessment of our capital plan as part of the CCAR process to evaluate the strength of our capital planning practices, including our ability to identify, measure, and determine the appropriate amount of capital for our risks, and controls and governance supporting capital planning.\nOn March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule to integrate its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with certain ongoing regulatory capital requirements. The final rule, which applies to certain bank holding companies, including us, introduced an SCB and related changes to the capital planning and stress testing processes. The SCB became effective on October 1, 2020.\nIn the standardized approach, the SCB replaced the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%. The standardized approach SCB equals the greater of (i) 2.5%; and (ii) the maximum decline in our CET1 capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario over the supervisory stress test measurement period, plus the ratio of (a) the sum of the dollar amount of our planned common stock dividends for the fourth\nthrough seventh quarters of the supervisory stress test projection period to (b) our projected RWA for the quarter in which our projected CET1 capital ratio reaches its minimum in the supervisory stress test. Regulatory capital requirements under the standardized approach include the SCB, as summarized above, as well as our G-SIB capital surcharge and any applicable countercyclical capital buffer.\nThe final rule made related changes to capital planning and stress testing processes for bank holding companies subject to the SCB requirement. In particular, the final rule assumes that bank holding companies maintain a constant level of assets and RWA throughout the supervisory stress test projection period. In addition, under the final rule the supervisory stress test no longer assumes that bank holding companies make all nine quarters of planned capital distributions under stress, although the SCB incorporates the dollar amount of four quarters of planned common stock dividends, as described above.\nThe final rule did not change regulatory capital requirements under the advanced approaches, the Tier 1 leverage ratio or the SLR.\nOn June 25, 2020, we were notified by the Federal Reserve of the results from the 2020 DFAST stress test, including our preliminary SCB of 2.5%. On August 10, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that our final SCB effective October 1, 2020 is 2.5%, resulting in no change to our existing regulatory capital requirements.\nAlthough the final SCB rule changed the effect of the CCAR process so that the SCB applied to our baseline capital measures, rather than CCAR, is the source of our stress-based capital requirements, we continue to be subject to capital plan requirements and the CCAR process. Under the capital planning and CCAR requirements, our annual capital plan must include a description of all of our planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any capital qualifying instruments, any capital distributions, such as payments of dividends on, or repurchases of, our stock, and any similar action that the Federal Reserve determines could affect our consolidated capital. The capital plan must include a discussion of how we will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, including the minimum ratios under the Basel III rule, and serve as a source of strength to State Street Bank under supervisory stress scenarios. Changes in our strategy, merger or acquisition activity or unanticipated uses of capital could result in a change in our capital plan and its associated capital actions, including capital raises or modifications to planned capital actions, such as repurchases of our stock, and may require resubmission of the capital plan to the Federal Reserve if, among other reasons, we would not meet our regulatory capital requirements after making the proposed capital distribution.\nState Street Corporation | 15\nIn addition to its capital planning requirements, the Federal Reserve has the authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends, the repurchase of common stock, or other capital actions that reduce capital by the banking organizations it supervises, including the Parent Company and State Street Bank, if, in the Federal Reserve’s opinion, the capital action would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. All of these policies and other requirements could affect our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our stock or require us to provide capital assistance to State Street Bank and any other banking subsidiary. Our common stock and other stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount thereof, remain subject to consideration and approval by our Board of Directors at the relevant times.\nIn connection with our 2019 capital plan, our Board approved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 (the 2019 Program). We repurchased a total of $1.0 billion of our common stock in the third and fourth quarters of 2019 under the 2019 Program and a total of $500 million of our common stock in the first quarter of 2020 under the 2019 Program. On March 16, 2020, we, along with the other U.S. G-SIBs, suspended common share repurchases and maintained this suspension through the fourth quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This suspension was consistent with limitations imposed by the Federal Reserve beginning in the second quarter of 2020.\nOn June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced distribution limitations for CCAR banking organizations, including us, during the third quarter of 2020. On September 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it would extend the limitations for the fourth quarter of 2020. The limitations prohibited us from making any capital distribution (excluding any capital distribution arising from the issuance of a capital instrument eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio), unless otherwise approved by the Federal Reserve. During the third and fourth quarters of 2020, CCAR banking organizations were, however, authorized to make share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock related to employee stock ownership plans; provided that the organization did not increase the amount of its common stock dividends, to pay common stock dividends that did not exceed an amount equal to the average of the organization’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters, unless otherwise specified by the Federal Reserve; and to make scheduled payments on additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments.\nDue to the economic challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve required all participating CCAR banks to resubmit their capital plans under updated scenarios that were released by the Federal Reserve on September 17, 2020.\nWe resubmitted our 2020 Capital Plan and received results from the Federal Reserve on December 18, 2020. In addition to providing results, the Federal Reserve also announced modifications to  the applicable distribution limitations for CCAR banking organizations, including us, that would be in effect for the first quarter of 2021. The modified limitations continue to prohibit any capital distribution (excluding any capital distribution arising from the issuance of a capital instrument eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio), unless otherwise approved by the Federal Reserve. During the first quarter of 2021, CCAR banking organizations that are U.S. bank holding companies, including us, are, however, authorized to:\n•   pay common stock dividends and make share repurchases that, in the aggregate, do not exceed an amount equal to the average of the organization's net income for the four preceding calendar quarters, provided that the organization does not increase the amount of its common stock dividends to be larger than the level paid in the second quarter of 2020;\n•   make share repurchases that equal the amount of share issuances related to expensed employee compensation; and\n•   redeem and make scheduled payments on additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments.\nThe modified restrictions allow us to resume common share repurchases in the first quarter of 2021, and in January 2021 our Board approved a first quarter 2021 repurchase program for the purchase of up to $475 million of our common stock through March 31, 2021.\nWhen permitted, stock purchases may be made using various types of mechanisms, including open market purchases, accelerated share repurchases or transactions off market, and may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs. The timing of stock purchases, types of transactions and number of shares purchased will depend on several factors, including market conditions and State Street’s capital positions, financial performance and investment opportunities. Our common stock purchase programs do not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time. We may employ third-party broker/dealers to acquire shares on the open market in connection with our common stock purchase programs. The common stock purchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.\nThe Federal Reserve, under the Dodd-Frank Act, previously required us to conduct semi-annual State Street-run stress tests and to publicly disclose the summary results of our State Street-run stress\nState Street Corporation | 16\ntests under the severely adverse economic scenario.  We are also required to undergo an annual supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve. The EGRRCPA modifies certain aspects of these stress-testing requirements, reducing the number of scenarios in the Federal Reserve’s supervisory stress test from three to two and modifying our obligation to perform company-run stress-tests from semi-annually to annually. The Federal Reserve adopted a final rule in October 2019 that, among other things, implemented this modification.\nThe Volcker Rule\nWe are subject to the Volcker Rule and implementing regulations. The Volcker Rule prohibits banking entities, including us and our affiliates, from engaging in certain prohibited proprietary trading activities, as defined in the Volcker Rule regulations, subject to exemptions for market-making related activities, risk-mitigating hedging, underwriting and certain other activities. The Volcker Rule also requires banking entities to either restructure or divest certain ownership interests in, and relationships with, covered funds (as such terms are defined in the Volcker Rule regulations).\nThe Volcker Rule regulations require banking entities to establish extensive programs designed to promote compliance with the restrictions of the Volcker Rule. We have established a compliance program which we believe complies with the Volcker Rule regulations as currently in effect. Our compliance program restricts our ability in the future to service certain types of funds, in particular covered funds for which State Street Global Advisors acts as an advisor and certain types of trustee relationships. Consequently, Volcker Rule compliance entails both the cost of a compliance program and loss of certain revenue and future opportunities.\nIn October 2019, the Federal Reserve and the other federal financial regulatory agencies responsible for the Volcker Rule regulations adopted an interagency final rule that revised certain elements of those regulations. The changes focused on proprietary trading, including the metrics reporting requirements and certain requirements imposed in connection with permitted market making, underwriting and risk-mitigating hedging activities, including market-making in and underwriting of covered funds. These revisions became effective on January 1, 2020, with compliance required by January 1, 2021. The agencies responsible for the Volcker Rule regulations adopted a separate interagency final rule in June 2020 focused on the covered funds provisions which generally prohibit any banking entity from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund. These revisions became effective on October 1,\n2020. These revisions do not have a material impact on us.\nEnhanced Prudential Standards\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by the EGRRCPA, establishes a systemic risk regime to which large bank holding companies with $100 billion or more in consolidated assets, such as us, are subject. The Federal Reserve is required to tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies based on their size, complexity, risk profile and other factors. U.S. G-SIBs, such as us, are expected to remain subject to the most stringent requirements, including heightened capital, leverage, liquidity and risk management requirements and single-counterparty credit limits (SCCL).\nThe FSOC can recommend prudential standards, reporting and disclosure requirements for SIFIs to the Federal Reserve, and must approve any finding by the Federal Reserve that a financial institution poses a grave threat to financial stability and must undertake mitigating actions. The FSOC is also empowered to designate systemically important payment, clearing and settlement activities of financial institutions, subjecting them to prudential supervision and regulation, and, assisted by the Office of Financial Research within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, can gather data and reports from financial institutions, including us.\nUnder the Federal Reserve's enhanced prudential standards regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by the EGRRCPA, we are required to comply with various liquidity-related risk management standards and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing. This liquidity buffer is in addition to other liquidity requirements, such as the LCR and, when effective, the NSFR. The regulations also establish requirements and responsibilities for our risk committee and mandate risk management standards.\nOn June 14, 2018, the Federal Reserve finalized rules that established SCCL for large banking organizations. U.S. G-SIBs, including us, are subject to a limit of 15% of Tier 1 capital for aggregate net credit exposures to any “major counterparty” (defined to include other U.S. G-SIBs, foreign G-SIBs and non-bank systemically important financial institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve). In addition, we are subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital for aggregate net credit exposures to any other unaffiliated counterparty. The final SCCL rules became effective for us on January 1, 2020.\nThe Federal Reserve has established a rule that imposes contractual requirements on certain “qualified financial contracts” to which U.S. G-SIBs, including us, and their subsidiaries are parties. Under\nState Street Corporation | 17\nthe rule, certain qualified financial contracts generally must expressly provide that transfer restrictions and default rights against a U.S. G-SIB, or subsidiary of a U.S. G-SIB, are limited to the same extent as they would be under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act and their implementing regulations. In addition, certain qualified financial contracts may not, among other things, permit the exercise of any cross-default right against a U.S. G-SIB or subsidiary of a U.S. G-SIB based on an affiliate’s entry into insolvency, resolution or similar proceedings, subject to certain creditor protections. There is a phased-in compliance schedule based on counterparty type, and the first compliance date was January 1, 2019.\nThe systemic-risk regime also provides that for U.S. G-SIBs deemed to pose a grave threat to U.S. financial stability, the Federal Reserve, upon an FSOC vote, must limit that institution’s ability to merge, restrict its ability to offer financial products, require it to terminate activities, impose conditions on activities or, as a last resort, require it to dispose of assets. Upon a grave threat determination by the FSOC, the Federal Reserve must issue rules that require financial institutions subject to the systemic-risk regime to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 15 to 1 if the FSOC considers it necessary to mitigate the risk of the grave threat. The Federal Reserve also has the ability to establish further standards, including those regarding contingent capital, enhanced public disclosures and limits on short-term debt, including off-balance sheet exposures.\nRecovery and Resolution Planning\nWe are required to periodically submit a plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure, commonly referred to as a resolution plan or a living will, to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC under Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act. Through resolution planning, we seek, in the event of our insolvency, to maintain State Street Bank’s role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial system, while minimizing risk to the financial system and maximizing value for the benefit of our stakeholders. We have and will continue to focus management attention and resources to meet regulatory expectations with respect to resolution planning.\nWe submitted our updated 2019 165(d) resolution plan describing our preferred resolution strategy to the Federal Reserve and FDIC (the Agencies) before July 1, 2019, and our resolution strategy is materially consistent with our prior resolution strategy. In reviewing the 2019 plan, the Agencies noted meaningful improvements over prior plan submissions. The Agencies did not identify any deficiencies in the 2019 plan, but did identify one shortcoming related to the implementation of\ngovernance mechanisms. We submitted to the Agencies our plan to remediate this shortcoming in line with the expected timeframe. In addition to the above letter, the Federal Reserve and FDIC jointly issued a final rule that was published in the Federal Register on November 1, 2019. This final rule revised the implementation requirements under the Dodd- Frank Act's resolution planning provisions by means of establishing a biennial filing cycle for the U.S. G-SIBs, including State Street. This cycle alternates between a targeted resolution plan, followed two years later by a full resolution plan. The Agencies have published the scope for the upcoming targeted resolution plan to include the core elements of resolution planning and some specific firm level information, including impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. The next resolution plan is due on July 1, 2021.\nIn the event of material financial distress or failure, our preferred resolution strategy is the SPOE Strategy. The SPOE Strategy provides that prior to the bankruptcy of the Parent Company and pursuant to a support agreement among the Parent Company, SSIF (a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company), our Beneficiary Entities (as defined below) and certain of our other entities, SSIF is obligated, up to its available resources, to recapitalize and/or provide liquidity to State Street Bank and the other entities benefiting from such capital and/or liquidity support (collectively with State Street Bank, “Beneficiary Entities”), in amounts designed to prevent the Beneficiary Entities from themselves entering into resolution proceedings. Following the recapitalization of, or provision of liquidity to the Beneficiary Entities, the Parent Company would enter into a bankruptcy proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Beneficiary Entities and our other subsidiaries would be transferred to a newly organized holding company held by a reorganization trust for the benefit of the Parent Company’s claimants.\nUnder the support agreement, the Parent Company pre-funded SSIF by contributing certain of its assets (primarily its liquid assets, cash deposits, investments in intercompany debt, investments in marketable securities and other cash and non-cash equivalent investments) to SSIF at the time it entered into the support agreement and will continue to contribute such assets, to the extent available, on an ongoing basis. In consideration for these contributions, SSIF has agreed in the support agreement to provide capital and liquidity support to the Parent Company and all of the Beneficiary Entities in accordance with the Parent Company’s capital and liquidity policies. Under the support agreement, the Parent Company is only permitted to retain cash needed to meet its upcoming obligations and to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding. SSIF has provided the Parent\nState Street Corporation | 18\nCompany with a committed credit line and issued (and may issue) one or more promissory notes to the Parent Company (the \"Parent Company Funding Notes\") that together are intended to allow the Parent Company to continue to meet its obligations throughout the period prior to the occurrence of a \"Recapitalization Event\" (as defined below). The support agreement does not obligate SSIF to maintain any specific level of resources and SSIF may not have sufficient resources to implement the SPOE Strategy.\nIn the event a Recapitalization Event occurs, the obligations outstanding under the Parent Company Funding Notes would automatically convert into or be exchanged for capital contributed to SSIF. The obligations of the Parent Company and SSIF under the support agreement are secured through a security agreement that grants a lien on the assets that the Parent Company and SSIF would use to fulfill their obligations under the support agreement to the Beneficiary Entities. SSIF is a distinct legal entity separate from the Parent Company and the Parent Company’s other affiliates.\nIn accordance with our policies, we are required to monitor, on an ongoing basis, the capital and liquidity needs of State Street Bank and our other Beneficiary Entities. To support this process, we have established a trigger framework that identifies key actions that would need to be taken or decisions that would need to be made if certain events tied to our financial condition occur. In the event that we experience material financial distress, the support agreement requires us to model and calculate certain capital and liquidity triggers on a regular basis to determine whether or not the Parent Company should commence preparations for a bankruptcy filing and whether or not a Recapitalization Event has occurred.\nUpon the occurrence of a Recapitalization Event: (1) SSIF would not be authorized to provide any further liquidity to the Parent Company; (2) the Parent Company would be required to contribute to SSIF any remaining assets it is required to contribute to SSIF under the support agreement (which specifically exclude amounts designated to fund expected expenses during a potential bankruptcy proceeding); (3) SSIF would be required to provide capital and liquidity support to the Beneficiary Entities to support such entities’ continued operation to the extent of its available resources and consistent with the support agreement; and (4) the Parent Company would be expected to commence Chapter 11 proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. No person or entity, other than a party to the support agreement, should rely on any of our affiliates being or remaining a Beneficiary Entity or receiving capital or liquidity support pursuant to the support agreement, including in evaluating any of our entities from a creditor's perspective or determining whether\nto enter into a contractual relationship with any of our entities.\nA “Recapitalization Event” is defined under the support agreement as the earlier occurrence of: (1) one or more capital and liquidity thresholds being breached or (2) the authorization by the Parent Company's Board of Directors for the Parent Company to commence bankruptcy proceedings. The thresholds are set at levels intended to provide for the availability of sufficient capital and liquidity to enable an orderly resolution without extraordinary government support. The SPOE Strategy and the obligations under the support agreement may result in the recapitalization of State Street Bank and the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent Company at an earlier stage of financial stress than might otherwise occur without such mechanisms in place. An expected effect of the SPOE Strategy and applicable TLAC regulatory requirements is that our losses will be imposed on the Parent Company shareholders and the holders of long-term debt and other forms of TLAC securities currently outstanding or issued in the future by the Parent Company, as well as on any other Parent Company creditors, before any of our losses are imposed on the holders of the debt securities of the Parent Company's operating subsidiaries or any of their depositors or creditors, or before U.S. taxpayers are put at risk.\nState Street Bank is also required to submit periodically to the FDIC a plan for resolution in the event of its failure, referred to as an Insured Depository Institution plan. In November 2018, the FDIC announced that until the FDIC completed revisions to its IDI plan requirements, no IDI plans would be required to be filed. In January 2021, the FDIC lifted the moratorium on IDI plan filings for IDIs with $100 billion or more in assets, including State Street Bank. In lifting the moratorium, the FDIC stated that it will provide at least 12 months’ advance notice prior to requiring submission of an institution’s next IDI plan.\nAdditionally, we are required to submit a recovery plan for State Street to the Federal Reserve. This plan includes detailed governance triggers and contingency actions that can be implemented in a timely manner in the event of extreme financial distress in those entities.\nOrderly Liquidation Authority\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, certain financial companies, including bank holding companies such as the Parent Company, and certain covered subsidiaries, can be subjected to the orderly liquidation authority which went into effect in 2010. For the FDIC to be appointed as our receiver, two-thirds of the FDIC Board and two-thirds of the Federal Reserve Board must recommend appointment, and the U.S. Treasury Secretary, in consultation with the U.S. President, must then make certain extraordinary\nState Street Corporation | 19\nfinancial distress and systemic risk determinations. Absent such actions, we, as a bank holding company, would remain subject to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nThe orderly liquidation authority went into effect in 2010, and rulemaking is proceeding incrementally, with some regulations now finalized and others planned but not yet proposed. If the FDIC were appointed as the receiver of the Parent Company pursuant to the orderly liquidation authority, the FDIC would have considerable powers to resolve the Parent Company, including: (1) the power to remove officers and directors responsible for the Parent Company's failure and to appoint new directors and officers; (2) the power to assign assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review; (3) the ability to differentiate among similarly situated creditors, subject to a minimum recovery right to receive at least what they would have received in bankruptcy liquidation; and (4) broad powers to administer the claims process to determine distributions from the assets of the receivership to creditors not transferred to a third party or bridge financial institution.\nIn 2013, the FDIC released its proposed SPOE strategy for resolution of a SIFI under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC’s release outlines how it would use its powers under the orderly liquidation authority to resolve a SIFI by placing its top-tier U.S. holding company in receivership and keeping its operating subsidiaries open and out of insolvency proceedings by transferring the operating subsidiaries to a new bridge holding company, recapitalizing the operating subsidiaries and imposing losses on the shareholders and creditors of the holding company in receivership according to their statutory order of priority.\nDerivatives\nTitle VII of the Dodd-Frank Act imposed a comprehensive regulatory structure on the OTC derivatives market, including requirements for clearing, exchange trading, capital, margin, reporting and record-keeping. Title VII also requires certain persons to register as a major swap participant, a swap dealer or a securities-based swap dealer. The CFTC, the SEC, and other U.S. regulators have largely implemented key provisions of Title VII, although certain final regulations have only been in place a short period of time and others have not been finalized. Through this rulemaking process, these regulators collectively have adopted or proposed, among other things, regulations relating to reporting and record-keeping obligations, margin and capital requirements, the scope of registration and the central clearing and exchange trading requirements for certain OTC derivatives. The CFTC has also issued rules to enhance the oversight of clearing and trading entities. The CFTC, along with other\nregulators, including the Federal Reserve, have also issued rules with respect to margin requirements for uncleared derivatives transactions.\nState Street Bank has registered provisionally with the CFTC as a swap dealer. As a provisionally registered swap dealer, State Street Bank is subject to significant regulatory obligations regarding its swap activity and the supervision, examination and enforcement powers of the CFTC and other regulators. The CFTC has granted State Street Bank a limited-purpose swap dealer designation. Under this limited-purpose designation, interest rate swap activity engaged in by State Street Bank’s Global Treasury group is not subject to certain of the swap regulatory requirements otherwise applicable to swaps entered into by a registered swap dealer, subject to a number of conditions. For all other swap transactions, our swap activities remain subject to all applicable swap dealer regulations.\nSubsidiaries\nThe Federal Reserve is the primary federal banking agency responsible for regulating us and our subsidiaries, including State Street Bank, with respect to both our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. Our banking subsidiaries are subject to supervision and examination by various regulatory authorities and have regulatory requirements that may differ from State Street Corporation.\nState Street Bank\nState Street Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System, its deposits are insured by the FDIC and it is subject to applicable federal and state banking laws and to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, as well as by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, and the regulatory authorities of those states and countries in which State Street Bank operates a branch.\nAs with the Parent Company, State Street Bank is considered an advanced approaches banking organization subject to the Basel III framework in the U.S. and is also subject to the market risk capital rule jointly issued by U.S. Agencies to implement the changes to the market risk capital framework in the U.S.\nAs required by the Dodd-Frank Act, State Street Bank, as an advanced approaches banking organization, is subject to a \"capital floor,\" also referred to as the Collins Amendment, in the assessment of its regulatory capital adequacy, including the capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer described above in this \"Supervision and Regulation\" section.\nUnder the Basel III rule, State Street Bank's  regulatory capital calculations, including any additions or deductions from capital for regulatory purposes, are consistent with the calculations of the Parent Company.\nState Street Corporation | 20\nSimilar to our Parent Company, State Street Bank is subject to the Tier 1 leverage ratio and the supplementary leverage ratio.\nHowever, as State Street Bank is the insured depository institution subsidiary of one of the eight US G-SIBs, it is required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% and a minimum SLR of 6% to be considered well-capitalized.\nFurthermore, for the purposes of calculating the SLR ratio, State Street Bank is similarly subject to a final rule adopted by the U.S. Agencies that establishes a deduction for central bank deposits from a custodial banking organization’s total leverage exposure. For the quarter ended December 31, 2020, State Street Bank excluded $76.7 billion of average balances held on deposit at central banks from the  denominator used in the calculation of our SLR based on this custodial banking exclusion. In addition, State Street Bank is temporarily permitted, until March 31, 2021, to elect to exclude U.S. Treasury securities from the calculation of the SLR denominator, provided that, in order to make such an election, it must request regulatory approval before making capital distributions, including paying dividends to its parent company, as long as the exclusion is in effect. State Street Bank elected not to take this temporary exclusion and accordingly did not exclude U.S. Treasury securities from the calculation of the SLR denominator.\nPursuant to the BCBS NSFR final rule, as a subsidiary of a U.S. G-SIB, State Street Bank will be similarly required to maintain an NSFR that is equal to or greater than 100%.\nWe and our subsidiaries that are not subsidiaries of State Street Bank are affiliates of State Street Bank under federal banking laws, which impose restrictions on various types of transactions, including loans, extensions of credit, investments or asset purchases by or from State Street Bank, on the one hand, to us and those of our subsidiaries, on the other. Transactions of this kind between State Street Bank and its affiliates generally are limited with respect to each affiliate to 10% of State Street Bank’s capital and surplus, as defined by the aforementioned banking laws, are limited in the aggregate for all affiliates to 20% of State Street Bank's capital and surplus, and in some cases are also subject to strict collateral requirements. Derivatives, securities borrowing and securities lending transactions between State Street Bank and its affiliates became subject to these restrictions pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act also expanded the scope of transactions required to be collateralized. In addition, the Volcker Rule generally prohibits similar transactions between the Parent Company or any of its affiliates and covered funds for which we or any of our affiliates serve as the investment manager, investment adviser, commodity trading advisor or sponsor and other covered funds organized and\noffered pursuant to specific exemptions in the Volcker Rule regulations.\nFederal law also requires that certain transactions by a bank with affiliates be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions involving other non-affiliated companies. Alternatively, in the absence of comparable transactions, the transactions must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to, or would apply to, non-affiliated companies.\nState Street Bank is also prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or lease or sale of property or furnishing of services. Federal law provides for a depositor preference on amounts realized from the liquidation or other resolution of any depository institution insured by the FDIC.\nOther Subsidiaries\nOur other subsidiary trust companies are subject to supervision and examination by the OCC, the Federal Reserve or by the appropriate state banking regulatory authorities of the states in which they are organized and operate. Our non-U.S. banking subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate.\nOur subsidiaries, State Street Global Advisors FM and State Street Global Advisors Ltd., act as investment advisers to investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. State Street Global Advisors FM, incorporated in Massachusetts in 2001 and headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and is registered with the CFTC as a commodity trading adviser and pool operator. State Street Global Advisors Ltd., incorporated in 1990 as a U.K. limited company and domiciled in the U.K., is also registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. State Street Global Advisors Ltd. is also authorized and regulated by the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (U.K. FCA) and is an investment firm under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. Our subsidiary, State Street Global Advisors Asia Limited, a Hong Kong incorporated company, is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC and additionally is licensed by the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong to perform a variety of activities, including asset management. State Street Global Advisors Asia Limited also holds permits as a qualified foreign institutional Investor (QFII) and a renminbi qualified foreign institutional investor (RQFII), approved by the Securities Regulatory Commission in the People’s Republic of\nState Street Corporation | 21\nChina, and in Korea is registered with the Financial Services Commission as a cross-border investment advisory company and a cross-border discretionary investment management company. In addition, a major portion of our investment management activities are conducted by State Street Global Advisors Trust Company, which is a subsidiary of State Street Bank and a Massachusetts chartered limited purpose trust company subject to the supervision of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and the Federal Reserve with respect to these activities.\nMany aspects of our investment management activities are subject to federal and state laws and regulations primarily intended to benefit the investment holder, rather than our shareholders. These laws and regulations generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict us from conducting our investment management activities in the event that we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, and examination authority. Our business related to investment management and trusteeship of collective trust funds and separate accounts offered to employee benefit plans is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and is regulated by the U.S. DOL.\nWe have three subsidiaries that operate as a U.S. broker/dealer and are registered as such with the SEC, are subject to regulation by the SEC (including the SEC's net capital rule) and are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a self-regulatory organization. State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC operates as a limited purpose broker/dealer that provides distributing and related marketing activities for U.S. mutual funds and ETFs associated with State Street Global Advisors. State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC also may privately offer certain State Street Global Advisors advised funds. State Street Global Markets, LLC is a U.S. broker/dealer that provides agency execution services. We also acquired Charles River Brokerage, LLC, a U.S. broker/dealer, as part of our acquisition of CRD. In addition, we have a subsidiary, SwapEX, LLC, registered with the CFTC in the U.S. as a swap execution facility.\nOur businesses, including our investment management and securities businesses, are also regulated extensively by non-U.S. governments, securities exchanges, self-regulatory organizations, central banks and regulatory bodies, especially in those jurisdictions in which we maintain an office. For instance, among others, the U.K. FCA and the United Kingdom Prudential Regulation Authority regulate our activities in the U.K.; the Central Bank of Ireland regulates our activities in Ireland; the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority regulates our\nactivities in Germany; the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier regulates our activities in Luxembourg; our German banking group is also subject to direct supervision by the European Central Bank under the ECB Single Supervisory Mechanism; the Securities and Futures Commission regulates our asset management activities in Hong Kong; the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission regulate our activities in Australia; and the Financial Services Agency and the Bank of Japan regulate our activities in Japan. We have established policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with the requirements of these organizations. However, as a global financial services institution, we face complexity, costs and risks related to regulation.\nThe majority of our non-U.S. asset servicing operations are conducted pursuant to the Federal Reserve's Regulation K through State Street Bank’s Edge Act subsidiary or through international branches of State Street Bank. An Edge Act corporation is a corporation organized under federal law that conducts foreign business activities. In general, banks may not make investments in their Edge Act corporations (and similar state law corporations) that exceed 20% of their capital and surplus, as defined in the relevant banking regulations, and the investment of any amount in excess of 10% of capital and surplus requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve.\nIn addition to our non-U.S. operations conducted pursuant to Regulation K, we also make new investments abroad directly (through us or through our non-banking subsidiaries) pursuant to the Federal Reserve's Regulation Y, or through international bank branch expansion, neither of which is subject to the investment limitations applicable to Edge Act subsidiaries.\nAdditionally, Massachusetts has its own bank holding company statute, under which we, among other things, may be required to obtain prior approval by the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation for an acquisition of more than 5% of any additional bank's voting shares, or for other forms of bank acquisitions.\nAnti-Money Laundering and Financial Transparency\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and related regulations, which contain AML and financial transparency provisions and which require implementation of an AML compliance program, including processes for verifying client identification and monitoring client transactions and detecting and reporting suspicious activities. AML laws outside the U.S. contain similar requirements. We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to\nState Street Corporation | 22\npromote compliance with applicable AML laws and regulations. AML laws and regulations applicable to our operations may be more stringent than similar requirements applicable to our non-regulated competitors or financial institutions principally operating in other jurisdictions. Compliance with applicable AML and related requirements is a common area of review for financial regulators, and any failure by us to comply with these requirements could result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions, difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals, restrictions on our business activities or harm to our reputation.\nDeposit Insurance\nThe Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the general $250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits. The FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) is funded by assessments on FDIC-insured depository institutions. The FDIC assesses DIF premiums based on an insured depository institution's average consolidated total assets, less the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period. For larger institutions, such as State Street Bank, assessments are determined based on regulatory ratings and forward-looking financial measures to calculate the assessment rate, which is subject to adjustments by the FDIC, and the assessment base.\nThe FDIC is required to determine whether and to what extent adjustments to the assessment base are appropriate for “custody banks\" that satisfy specified institutional eligibility criteria. The FDIC has concluded that certain liquid assets could be excluded from the deposit insurance assessment base of custody banks. This has the effect of reducing the amount of DIF insurance premiums due from custody banks. State Street Bank qualifies as a custody bank for this purpose. The custody bank assessment adjustment may not exceed total transaction account deposits identified by the institution as being directly linked to a fiduciary or custody and safekeeping asset.\nPrompt Corrective Action\nThe FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 requires the appropriate federal banking regulator to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards, including minimum capital ratios. While these regulations apply only to banks, such as State Street Bank, the Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate action against a parent bank holding company, such as our Parent Company, based on the under-capitalized status of any banking subsidiary. In certain instances, we would be required to guarantee the performance of a capital restoration plan if one of our banking subsidiaries were undercapitalized.\nSupport of Subsidiary Banks\nUnder Federal Reserve regulations, a bank holding company such as our Parent Company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its banking subsidiaries. This requirement was added to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act by the Dodd-Frank Act. This means that we have a statutory obligation to commit resources to State Street Bank and any other banking subsidiary in circumstances in which we otherwise might not do so absent such a requirement. In the event of bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a banking subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and will be entitled to a priority payment.\nInsolvency of an Insured U.S. Subsidiary Depository Institution\nIf the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an FDIC-insured U.S. subsidiary depository institution, such as State Street Bank, upon its insolvency or certain other events, the FDIC has the ability to transfer any of the depository institution’s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution’s creditors, enforce the terms of the depository institution’s contracts pursuant to their terms or repudiate or disaffirm contracts or leases to which the depository institution is a party. Additionally, the claims of holders of deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution, including claims of debt holders of the institution and, under current interpretation, depositors in non-U.S. branches and offices, in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, such persons would be treated differently from and could receive, if anything, substantially less than the depositors in U.S. offices of the depository institution.\nCyber Risk Management\nIn October 2016, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding enhanced cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, including us and our banking subsidiaries. The proposed standards would expand existing cyber-security regulations and guidance to focus on cyber risk governance and management; management of internal and external dependencies; and incident response, cyber resilience and situational awareness. In addition, the proposal contemplates more stringent standards for institutions with systems that are critical to the financial sector. Although the FDIC and OCC in 2019 each withdrew\nState Street Corporation | 23\nthe advance notice of proposed rulemaking, the Federal Reserve has not withdrawn the advance notice and may still propose such a rule.\nFurther discussion of cyber-security risk management is provided in \"Information Technology Risk Management\" included in our Management's Discussion and Analysis in this Form 10-K.\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES\nEconomic policies of the U.S. government and its agencies influence our operating environment. Monetary policy conducted by the Federal Reserve directly affects the level of interest rates, which may affect overall credit conditions of the economy. Monetary policy is applied by the Federal Reserve through open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in reserve requirements for depository institutions, and changes in the discount rate and availability of borrowing from the Federal Reserve. Government regulation of banks and bank holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors of the banks, rather than for the shareholders of the institutions and therefore may, in some cases, be adverse to the interests of those shareholders. We are similarly affected by the economic policies of non-U.S. government agencies, such as the ECB.\nSTATISTICAL DISCLOSURE BY BANK HOLDING COMPANIES\nThe following information included under Items 6, 7 and 8 in this Form 10-K, is incorporated by reference herein:\n“Selected Financial Data” table (Item 6) - presents return on average common equity, return on average assets, common dividend payout and equity-to-assets ratios.\n“Distribution of Average Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity; Interest Rates and Interest Differential” table (Item 8) - presents consolidated average balance sheet amounts, related fully taxable-equivalent interest earned and paid, related average yields and rates paid and changes in fully taxable-equivalent interest income and interest expense for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\n“Investment Securities” section included in our Management's Discussion and Analysis (Item 7) and Note 3, “Investment Securities,” to the consolidated financial statements (Item 8) - disclose information regarding book values, market values, maturities and weighted-average yields of securities (by category).\n“Loans and Leases” section included in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Item 7) and Note 4, “Loans,” to the consolidated financial statements (Item 8) - disclose our policy for placing loans and leases on non-accrual status and\ndistribution of loans, loan maturities and sensitivities of loans to changes in interest rates.\n“Loans and Leases” and “Cross-Border Outstandings” sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Item 7) - disclose information regarding our cross-border outstandings and other loan concentrations.\n“Credit Risk Management” section included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Item 7) and Note 4, “Loans,” to the consolidated financial statements (Item 8) - present the allocation of the allowance for credit losses, and a description of factors which influenced management’s judgment in determining amounts of additions or reductions to the allowance, if any, charged or credited to results of operations.\n“Distribution of Average Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity; Interest Rates and Interest Differential” table (Item 8) - discloses deposit information.\nNote 8, “Short-Term Borrowings,” to the consolidated financial statements (Item 8) - discloses information regarding our short-term borrowings."

    "text": "Risk Factors\nIn the normal course of our business activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks. The following is a discussion of material risk factors applicable to us. Additional information about our risk management framework is included under “Risk Management” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis in this Form 10-K. Additional risks beyond those described in our Management's Discussion and Analysis or in the following discussion may apply to our activities or operations as currently conducted, or as we may conduct them in the future, or in the markets in which we operate or may in the future operate.\nStrategic Risks\nWe are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our business, which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.\nThe markets in which we operate across all facets of our business are both highly competitive and global. These markets are changing as a result of new and evolving laws and regulations applicable to financial services institutions. Regulatory-driven market changes cannot always be anticipated, and may adversely affect the demand for, and profitability of, the products and services that we offer. In addition, new market entrants and competitors may address changes in the markets more rapidly than we do, may have materially greater resources to invest in infrastructure and product development than we do, or may provide clients with a more attractive offering of products and services, adversely affecting our\nState Street Corporation | 24\nbusiness. Our efforts to develop and market new products, particularly in the “Fintech” sector, may position us in new markets with pre-existing competitors with strong market position. We have also experienced, and anticipate that we will continue to experience, significant pricing pressure in many of our core businesses, particularly our custodial and investment management services. This pricing pressure has and may continue to impact our revenue growth and operational margins and may limit the positive impact of new client demand and growth in AUC/A. Many of our businesses compete with other domestic and international banks and financial services companies, such as custody banks, investment advisors, broker/dealers, outsourcing companies and data processing companies. Further consolidation within the financial services industry could also pose challenges to us in the markets we serve, including potentially increased downward pricing pressure across our businesses.\nSome of our competitors including our competitors in core services, have substantially greater capital resources than we do, are not subject to as stringent capital or other regulatory requirements as we are, or may not be as constrained as we are by these requirements due to the relative size of our balance sheet. In some of our businesses, we are service providers to significant competitors. These competitors are in some instances significant clients, and the retention of these clients involves additional risks, such as the avoidance of actual or perceived conflicts of interest and the maintenance of high levels of service quality and intra-company confidentiality. The ability of a competitor to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price would likely negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. Many of our core services are subject to contracts that have relatively short terms or may be terminated by our client after a short notice period. In addition, pricing pressures as a result of the activities of competitors, client pricing reviews, and rebids, as well as the introduction of new products, may result in a reduction in the prices we can charge for our products and services.\nWe are subject to variability in our assets under custody and/or administration and assets under management, and in our financial results, due to the significant size of many of our institutional clients, and are also subject to significant pricing pressure due to the considerable market influence exerted by those clients.\nOur clients include institutional investors, such as mutual funds, collective investment funds, UCITS, hedge funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments and investment managers. In both our asset servicing and asset management businesses, we endeavor to attract institutional\ninvestors controlling large and diverse pools of assets, as those clients typically have the opportunity to benefit from the full range of our expertise and service offerings. Due to the large pools of assets controlled by these clients, the loss or gain of one client, or even a portion of the assets controlled by one client, could have a significant effect on our AUC/A or our AUM, as applicable, in the relevant period. Loss of all or a portion of the servicing of a client's assets can occur for a variety of reasons.\nF\nor example, as a result of a decision to diversify providers, one of our large asset servicing clients has advised us it expects to move a significant portion of its ETF assets currently with State Street to one or more other providers, pending necessary approvals.  The transition is expected to begin in 2022 but will principally occur in 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the fee revenue associated with the transitioning assets represented approximately 1.5% of our total fee revenue.\nOur AUM or AUC/A are also affected by decisions by institutional owners to favor or disfavor certain investment instruments or categories. Similarly, if one or more clients change the asset class in which a significant portion of assets are invested (e.g., by shifting investments from emerging markets to the U.S.), those changes could have a significant effect on our results of operations in the relevant period, as our fee rates often change based on the type of asset classes we are servicing or managing. As our fee revenue is significantly impacted by our levels of AUC/A and AUM, changes in levels of different asset classes could have a corresponding significant effect on our results of operations in the relevant period. Large institutional clients also, by their nature, are often able to exert considerable market influence, and this, combined with strong competitive forces in the markets for our services, has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant pressure to reduce the fees we charge for our services in both our asset servicing and asset management lines of business. Our strategy of focusing our efforts on the segments of the market for investor services represented by very large asset managers and asset owners causes us to be particularly impacted by this industry trend. Many of these large clients are also under competitive and regulatory pressures that are driving them to manage the expenses that they and their investment products incur more aggressively, which in turn exacerbates their pressures on our fees.\nDevelopment and completion of new products and services, including State Street Alpha, may impose costs on us, involve dependencies on third parties and may expose us to increased operational and model risk.\nOur financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to develop and market new and innovative services and to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate our products or provide cost efficiencies, while avoiding increased related\nState Street Corporation | 25\nexpenses. This dependency is exacerbated in the current “FinTech” environment, where financial institutions are investing significantly in evaluating new technologies, such as distributed ledger technology (“Blockchain\"), and developing potentially industry-changing products, services and standards. For example, in 2018, we acquired CRD, and are leveraging the capabilities acquired to create State Street Alpha by combining with offerings from our Investment Servicing business line. The introduction of new products and services can require significant time and resources, including regulatory approvals and the development and implementation of technical data management, control and model validation requirements and effective security and resiliency elements. New products and services, such as State Street Alpha, often also involve dependencies on third parties to, among other things, access innovative technologies, develop new distribution channels or form collaborative product and service offerings, and can require complex strategic alliances and joint venture relationships. Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, strategic alliances and joint ventures, including rapid technological change in the industry, our ability to access technical, data and other information from our clients, significant and ongoing investments required to bring new products and services to market in a timely manner at competitive prices, sharing of benefits in those relationships, conflicts with existing business partners and clients, protection of intellectual property, the competition for employees with the necessary expertise and experience and sales and other materials that fully and accurately describe the product or service and its underlying risks and are compliant with applicable regulations. New products or services may fail to operate or perform as expected and may not be suitable for the intended client or may not produce anticipated efficiencies, savings or benefits for either the client or us. Our failure to manage these risks and uncertainties also exposes us to enhanced risk of operational lapses, which may result in the recognition of financial statement\nliabilities. Regulatory and internal control requirements, capital requirements, competitive alternatives, vendor relationships and\nshifting\nmarket\npreferences may also determine if such initiatives can be brought to market in a manner that is timely and attractive to our clients. Failure to successfully manage all of the above risks in the development and implementation of new products or services, including completion of State Street Alpha, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation, consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business may be negatively affected by our failure to update and maintain our technology infrastructure.\nIn order to maintain and grow our business, we must make strategic decisions about our current and future business plans and effectively execute upon those plans. Strategic initiatives that we are currently developing or executing against include cost initiatives, enhancements and efficiencies to our operational processes, improvements to existing and new service offerings,  targeting for sales growth certain segments of the markets for investor services and asset management, and enhancements to existing and development of new information technology and other systems. Implementing strategic programs and creating cost efficiencies involves certain strategic, technological and operational risks. Many features of our present initiatives include investment in systems integration and new technologies and also the development of new, and the evolution of existing, methods and tools to accelerate the pace of innovation, the introduction of new services and enhancements to the resiliency of our systems and operations. These initiatives also may result in increased or unanticipated costs or earnings volatility, may take longer than anticipated to implement and may result in increases in operating losses, inadvertent data disclosures or other operating errors. In implementing these programs, we may have material dependencies on third parties. The transition to new operating processes and technology infrastructure may also cause disruptions in our relationships with clients and employees or loss of institutional understanding and may present other unanticipated technical or operational hurdles. In addition, the relocation to or expansion of servicing activities and other operations in different geographic regions or vendors may entail client, regulatory and other third party data use, storage and security challenges, as well as other regulatory compliance, business continuity and other considerations. As a result, we may not achieve some or all of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits and may experience unanticipated challenges from clients, regulators or other parties or reputational harm. In addition, some systems development initiatives may not have access to significant resources or management attention and, consequently, may be delayed or unsuccessful. Many of our systems require enhancements to meet the requirements of evolving regulation, to enhance security and resiliency and decommission obsolete technologies, to permit us to optimize our use of capital or to reduce the risk of operating error. In addition, the implementation of our State Street Alpha platform and integration of CRD requires substantial systems development and expense. We may not have the\nState Street Corporation | 26\nresources to pursue all of these objectives simultaneously.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic Continues to Create Significant Risks and Uncertainties for Our Business.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios and other regulatory requirements in the United States and internationally, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness of our work from home arrangements and staffing levels in operational facilities, challenges associated with our return to office plans such as maintaining a safe office environment and integrating at-home and in-office staff, the impact of market participants on which we rely, actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic and the impact of equity market valuations and extended sales and implementation cycles for some clients on our service and management fee revenue.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, caused fluctuations in equity market valuations, at times decreased liquidity in fixed income markets, created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets, increased unemployment levels and disrupted global supply chains. This has created, at peak periods of volatility, extraordinary demand on our transaction processing capabilities in our asset servicing business and volatility in our foreign exchange and asset management businesses. The market and economic uncertainty has also increased the risks inherent in our activities as a credit provider to investment pools and other institutional investors and caused us to increase our provision for credit losses. In addition, our and other market participants’ reliance upon work from home capabilities, and the potential inability to maintain critical staff in our operational facilities, including facilities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, China, India and Poland, present risks associated with our and local infrastructure, increasingly restrictive local regulations, illness, quarantine, the sustainability of a work from home environment and increased risk of cyber-security attacks. Any material or extended disruption of our ability to deliver services or meet our responsibilities in the settlement of securities or other market activities is likely to result in operating losses, loss of revenue or penalties under our service contracts which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition. Moreover, governmental actions in response to the pandemic are meaningfully influencing the interest rate environment, which has reduced, and may continue to reduce, our net interest income and net interest margin.\nIn March 2020, we announced, together with the other U.S.-based G-SIBs, that we temporarily suspended our common stock repurchase program, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, in connection with a requirement for all CCAR banking organizations, including State Street, to participate in additional supervisory capital stress tests due to the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve limited the ability of all CCAR banking organizations to make capital distributions for the remainder of 2020.  As a result, we did not return capital to shareholders in the form of common stock repurchases during the nine months ended December 31, 2020. In December 2020, we announced, following the results of the additional stress test, that we have been authorized to continue to pay common stock dividends at current levels and to resume purchasing common shares in the first quarter of 2021 in the aggregate amount up to the average of our quarterly net income during 2020.  However, there can be no assurance the Federal Reserve will not require additional stress testing, modify existing or apply new limitations on distributions of capital to shareholders or introduce new or additional regulatory actions, restrictions or requirements in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic or associated market or industry developments. Where permitted consistent with regulatory standards, the timing of stock purchases, types of transactions and number of shares purchased under our stock purchase programs will depend on several factors, including market conditions and our capital positions, financial performance and investment opportunities.  Our common stock purchase programs do not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.\nAcquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures pose risks for our business.\nAs part of our business strategy, we acquire complementary businesses and technologies, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and divest portions of our business. We undertake transactions of varying sizes to, among other reasons, expand our geographic footprint, access new clients, distribution channels, technologies or services, develop closer or more collaborative relationships with our business partners, efficiently deploy capital or leverage cost savings or other business or financial opportunities. We may not achieve the expected benefits of these transactions, which could result in increased costs, lowered revenues, ineffective deployment of capital, regulatory concerns, exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation.\nTransactions of this nature also involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, strategic, managerial, operational, cultural and employment challenges, which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and\nState Street Corporation | 27\nfinancial condition. For example, the businesses that we acquire or our strategic alliances or joint ventures may under-perform relative to the price paid or the resources committed by us; we may not achieve anticipated revenue growth or cost savings; or we may otherwise be adversely affected by acquisition-related charges. The intellectual property of an acquired business may be an important component of the value that we agree to pay for it. However, such acquisitions are subject to the risks that the acquired business may not own the intellectual property that we believe we are acquiring, that the intellectual property is dependent on licenses from third parties, that the acquired business infringes on the intellectual property rights of others, that the technology does not have the acceptance in the marketplace that we anticipated or that the technology requires significant investment to remain competitive. Similarly, such acquisitions present risks on our ability to retain the acquired talent, which may be essential to achieve our objectives in the acquisition. The integration of an acquired business's information technology infrastructure into ours has in the past and may in the future also expose us to additional security and resiliency risks. Further, past acquisitions have resulted in the recognition of goodwill and other significant intangible assets in our consolidated statement of condition. For example, we recorded goodwill and intangible assets of approximately $2.46 billion associated with our acquisition of CRD in 2018. These assets are not eligible for inclusion in regulatory capital under applicable requirements. In addition, we may be required to record impairment in our consolidated statement of income in future periods if we determine that the value of these assets has declined.\nThrough our acquisitions or joint ventures, we may also assume unknown or undisclosed business, operational, tax, regulatory and other liabilities, fail to properly assess known contingent liabilities or assume businesses with internal control deficiencies. While in most of our transactions we seek to mitigate these risks through, among other things, due diligence, indemnification provisions or insurance, these or other risk-mitigating provisions we put in place may not be sufficient to address these liabilities and contingencies and involve credit and execution risks associated with successfully seeking recourse from a third party, such as the seller or an insurance provider. Other major financial services firms have recently paid significant penalties to resolve government investigations into matters conducted in significant part by acquired entities.\nVarious regulatory approvals or consents, formal or informal, are generally required prior to closing of these transactions, which may include approvals, non-objections or regulatory exceptions from the Federal Reserve and other domestic and non-U.S.\nregulatory authorities. These regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the completion of the acquisition or require changes to its terms that materially affect the terms of the transaction or our ability to capture some of the opportunities presented by the transaction, or may not approve the transaction. Any such conditions, or any associated regulatory delays, could limit the benefits of the transaction. Acquisitions or joint ventures we announce may not be completed if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals, if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfied.\nThe integration and the retention and development of the benefits of our acquisitions result in risks to our business and other uncertainties.\nIn recent years, we have undertaken several acquisitions, including our 2018 acquisition of CRD and our 2016 acquisition of the General Electric Asset Management (GEAM) business. The integration of acquisitions presents risks that differ from the risks associated with our ongoing operations. Integration activities are complicated and time consuming and can involve significant unforeseen costs. We may not be able to effectively assimilate services, technologies, key personnel or businesses of acquired companies into our business or service offerings as anticipated, and we may not achieve related revenue growth or cost savings. We also face the risk of being unable to retain, or cross-sell our products or services to, the clients of acquired companies or joint ventures and the risk of being unable to cross-sell acquired products or services to our existing clients. In particular, some clients, including significant clients, of an acquired business may have the right to transition their business to other providers on short notice for convenience, fiduciary or other reasons and may take the opportunity of the acquisition or market, commercial, relationship, service satisfaction or other developments following the acquisition to terminate, reduce or renegotiate the fees or other terms of our relationship.  Any such client losses, reductions or renegotiations likely will reduce the expected benefits of the acquisition, including revenues, cross-selling opportunities and market share, cause impairment to goodwill and other intangibles or result in reputational harm, which effects could be material, and we may not have recourse against the seller of the business or the client. The risk of client loss is even greater where the client is a competitor of ours. Acquisitions of technology firms can involve extensive information technology integration, with associated risk of defects, security breaches and resiliency lapses and product enhancement and development activities, the costs of which can be difficult to estimate, as well as heightened cultural and compliance concerns in\nState Street Corporation | 28\nintegrating an unregulated firm into a bank regulatory environment. Acquisitions of Investment Servicing businesses entail information technology systems conversions, which involve operational risks, as well as fiduciary and other risks associated with client retention. Acquisitions of Asset Management businesses similarly involve fiduciary and similar risks associated with client retention, distribution channels and additional servicing opportunities.  Joint ventures involve all of these risks, as well as risks associated with shared control and decision-making (even in majority-owned situations), minority rights and exit rights, which can delay, challenge or foreclose execution on material opportunities or initiatives, create regulatory risks and limit divestment opportunities.\nWith any acquisition, the integration of the operations and resources of the businesses could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of our and the acquired company's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures or policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, business partners or employees, maintain regulatory compliance or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Integration efforts may also divert management attention and resources.\nIntegration of CRD and its business, operations and employees with our own may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the anticipated benefits and cost synergies of the acquisition may not be fully realized, which could adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe completed our acquisition of CRD on October 1, 2018. The success of the acquisition, including the achievement of anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies of the acquisition, continues to be subject to a number of uncertainties and will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate CRD’s business into our business in an efficient and effective manner. The combined company may face significant challenges in implementing such integration, including challenges related to:\n•\nintegrating CRD's business into our own in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost and operating synergies anticipated to result from the acquisition, which could result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisition not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;\n•\nretaining CRD’s clients, some of which are our competitors;\n•\nretaining key management and technical personnel;\n•\nintegrating CRD’s software solutions with our existing products and services and related operations and systems, including performance, risk and compliance analytics, investment manager operations outsourcing, accounting, administration and custody;\n•\naccelerating the development of enhancements to the features and functions of CRD’s software solutions;\n•\ncoordinating and integrating our internal operations, compensation programs, policies and procedures, and corporate structures;\n•\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen or increased costs and expenses;\n•\nthe possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process;\n•\nincurring significant acquisition-related costs and expenses associated with combining our operations; and\n•\nperformance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention and resources caused by integrating the companies’ operations.\nAny of these factors could result in our failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, on the expected timeline or at all, and could adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition for qualified members of our workforce is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to hire people or retain them, particularly in light of challenges associated with compensation restrictions applicable, or which may become applicable, to banks and some asset managers and that are not applicable to other financial services firms in all jurisdictions or to technology firms, generally. The unexpected loss of services of key personnel in business units, control functions, information technology, operations or other areas could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, their knowledge of our markets, operations and clients, their years of industry experience and, in some cases, the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. Similarly, the loss of key personnel, either individually or as a group, could adversely affect our clients' perception of our ability to continue to manage certain types of investment management mandates to provide other services to\nState Street Corporation | 29\nthem or to maintain a culture of innovation and proficiency.\nFinancial Market Risks\nGeopolitical and economic conditions and developments could adversely affect us, particularly if we face increased uncertainty and unpredictability in managing our businesses.\nGlobal financial markets can suffer from substantial volatility, illiquidity and disruption, particularly as a result of geopolitical disruptions, slower economic growth and a shifting monetary policy stance from key central banks. If such volatility, illiquidity or disruption were to result in an adverse economic environment in the U.S. or internationally or result in a lack of confidence in the financial stability of major developed or emerging markets, such developments could have an adverse effect on our business, as well as the businesses of our clients and our significant counterparties, and could also increase the difficulty and unpredictability of aligning our business strategies, our infrastructure and our operating costs in light of uncertain market and economic conditions. These risks could be compounded by tighter monetary policy conditions, disruptions to free trade and political uncertainty in the U.S. and internationally.\nMarket disruptions can adversely affect our consolidated results of operations if the value of our AUC/A or AUM decline, while the costs of providing the related services remain constant or increase. They may also result in investor preference trends towards asset classes and markets deemed more secure, such as cash or non-emerging markets, with respect to which our fee rates are often lower. These factors could reduce the profitability of our asset-based fee revenue and could also adversely affect our transaction-based revenue, such as revenues from securities finance and foreign exchange activities, and the volume of transactions that we execute for or with our clients. Further, the degree of volatility in foreign exchange rates can affect our foreign exchange trading revenue. In general, increased currency volatility tends to increase our market risk but also increases our opportunity to generate foreign exchange revenue. Conversely, periods of lower currency volatility tend to decrease our market risk but also decrease our foreign exchange revenue.\nIn addition, as our business grows globally and a significant percentage of our revenue is earned (and of our expenses paid) in currencies other than U.S. dollars, our exposure to foreign currency volatility could affect our levels of consolidated revenue, our consolidated expenses and our consolidated results of operations, as well as the value of our investment in our non-U.S. operations and our non-U.S. investment portfolio holdings. The extent to which\nchanges in the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies affect our consolidated results of operations, including the degree of any offset between increases or decreases to both revenue and expenses, will depend upon the nature and scope of our operations and activities in the relevant jurisdictions during the relevant periods, which may vary from period to period.\nAs our product offerings expand, in part as we seek to take advantage of perceived opportunities arising under various regulatory reforms and resulting market changes, the degree of our exposure to various market and credit risks will evolve, potentially resulting in greater revenue volatility.\nOur businesses have significant International operations, and disruptions in European and Asian economies could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nEuropean economic growth has faced significant impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, notably with growth in the European Union expected to contract markedly in 2021. New or continued economic deterioration will renew concerns about sovereign debt sustainability, interdependencies among financial institutions and sovereigns, and political and other risks despite stimulus from central banks. Continued uncertainty in the external environment has led to increased concern around the near- to medium-term outlook for economic progress in the regions in which we operate, including Europe and Asia.\nIn addition, uncertainty around implications of the United Kingdom's exit from the E.U., known as Brexit, and related developments, present risks which include potential negative impacts to economic activity or to cooperation in the future relationship between the U.K. and E.U. and the resulting consequences for market access for financial services. In order to conform to anticipated restrictions on activity between the E.U. and the U.K. following Brexit, we have developed and implemented plans that seek to maintain our servicing and operational capabilities, in all material respects, independent of the final outcome. There can be no assurance, however, that our plans will address effectively, in whole or in part, all potential contingencies associated with Brexit or that we may not experience additional costs or inefficiencies associated with our European activities or client dissatisfaction, delays in receiving regulatory approvals or other difficulties in executing our regional strategy.\nGiven the scope of our International operations, economic or market uncertainty, volatility, illiquidity or disruption resulting from these and related factors could have a material adverse impact on our\nState Street Corporation | 30\nconsolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nOur investment securities portfolio, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in market factors, including interest rates, credit spreads and credit performance.\nOur investment securities portfolio represented approximately 35% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020. The gross interest income associated with our investment portfolio represented approximately 14% of our total gross revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and has represented as much as 31% of our total gross revenue in the fiscal years since 2007. As such, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are materially exposed to the risks associated with our investment portfolio, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, credit performance (including risk of default), credit ratings, our access to liquidity, foreign exchange markets and mark- to-market valuations, and our ability to profitably manage changes in repayment rates of principal with respect to our portfolio securities. The continued low interest rate environment that has persisted since the financial crisis began in mid-2007 limits our ability to achieve a NIM consistent with our prior historical averages. In addition, certain regulatory liquidity standards, such as the LCR, require that we maintain minimum levels of HQLA in our investment portfolio, which generally generate lower rates of return than other investment assets. This has resulted in increased levels of HQLA as a percentage of our investment portfolio and an associated negative impact on our NII and our NIM. As a result we may not be able to attain our prior historical levels of NII and NIM. For additional information regarding these liquidity requirements, refer to the “Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio” section of “Supervision and Regulation” in Business in this Form 10-K. We may enter into derivative transactions to hedge or manage our exposure to interest rate risk, as well as other risks, such as foreign exchange risk and credit risk. Derivative instruments that we hold for these or other purposes may not achieve their intended results and could result in unexpected losses or stresses on our liquidity or capital resources.\nOur investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion of our consolidated statement of condition and our loan portfolio represents a smaller proportion (approximately 9% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020), in comparison to many other major financial institutions. In some respects, the accounting and regulatory treatment of our investment securities portfolio may be less favorable to us than a more traditional held-for-investment lending portfolio. For example, under the Basel III\nrule, after-tax changes in the fair value of AFS investment securities, such as those which represent a majority of our investment portfolio, are included in Tier 1 capital. Since loans held for investment are not subject to a fair value accounting framework, changes in the fair value of loans (other than expected credit losses) are not similarly included in the determination of Tier 1 capital under the Basel III rule. Due to this differing treatment, we may experience increased variability in our Tier 1 capital relative to other major financial institutions whose loan-and-lease portfolios represent a larger proportion of their consolidated total assets than ours.\nAdditional risks associated with our investment portfolio include:\n•\nAsset class concentration\n. Our investment portfolio continues to have significant concentrations in several classes of securities, including agency residential MBS, commercial MBS and other ABS, and securities with concentrated exposure to consumers. These classes and types of securities experienced significant liquidity, valuation and credit quality deterioration during the financial crisis that began in mid-2007. We also hold non-U.S. government securities, non-U.S. MBS and ABS with exposures to European countries, whose sovereign-debt markets have experienced increased stress at times since 2011 and may continue to experience stress in the future. For further information, refer to the risk factor titled\n“Our businesses have significant European operations, and disruptions in European economies could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition\".\nFurther, we hold a portfolio of U.S. state and municipal bonds, the value of which may be affected by the budget deficits that a number of states and municipalities currently face, resulting in risks associated with this portfolio.\n•\nEffects of market conditions\n. If market conditions deteriorate, our investment portfolio could experience a decline in market value, whether due to a decline in liquidity or an increase in the yield required by investors to hold such securities, regardless of our credit view of our portfolio holdings. In addition, in general, deterioration in credit quality, or changes in management's expectations regarding repayment timing or in management's investment intent to hold securities to maturity, in each case with respect to our portfolio holdings, could result in recognition of an allowance for expected credit losses or in impairment. Similarly, if a material portion of our investment portfolio were to experience credit deterioration, our\nState Street Corporation | 31\ncapital ratios as calculated pursuant to the Basel III rule could be adversely affected. This risk is greater with portfolios of investment securities that contain credit risk than with holdings of U.S. Treasury securities.\n•\nEffects of interest rates\n. Our investment portfolio is further subject to changes in both U.S. and non-U.S. (primarily in Europe) interest rates, and could be negatively affected by changes in those rates, whether or not expected. This is particularly true in the case of a quicker-than-anticipated increase in interest rates, which would decrease market values in the near-term, or monetary policy that results in persistently low or negative rates of interest on certain investments. The latter has been the case, for example, with respect to ECB monetary policy, including negative interest rates in some jurisdictions, with associated negative effects on our investment portfolio reinvestment, NII and NIM. The effect on our NII has been exacerbated by the effects in recent fiscal years  of the strong U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, particularly the Euro. If European interest rates remain low or decrease and the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the Euro, the negative effects on our NII likely will continue or increase. The overall level of NII can also be impacted by the size of our deposit base, as further increases in interest rates could lead to reduced deposit levels and also lower overall NII. Further, a reduction in deposit levels could increase the requirements under the regulatory liquidity standards requiring us to invest a greater proportion of our investment portfolio holdings in HQLA that have lower yields than other investable assets. See also, “Our business activities expose us to interest rate risk” in this section.\nOur business activities expose us to interest rate risk.\nIn our business activities, we assume interest rate risk by investing short-term deposits received from our clients in our investment portfolio of longer- and intermediate-term assets. Our NII and NIM are affected by among other things, the levels of interest rates in global markets, changes in the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates, the direction and speed of interest rate changes and the asset and liability spreads relative to the currency and geographic mix of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. These factors are influenced, among other things, by a variety of economic and market forces and expectations, including monetary policy and other activities of\ncentral banks, such as the Federal Reserve and ECB, that we do not control. Our ability to anticipate changes in these factors or to hedge the related on- and off-balance sheet exposures, and the cost of any such hedging activity, can significantly influence the success of our asset-and-liability management activities and the resulting level of our NII and NIM. The impact of changes in interest rates and related factors will depend on the relative duration and fixed- or floating-rate nature of our assets and liabilities. Sustained lower interest rates, a flat or inverted yield curve and narrow credit spreads generally have a constraining effect on our NII. In addition, our ability to change deposit rates in response to changes in interest rates and other market and related factors is limited by client relationship considerations. For additional information about the effects on interest rates on our business, refer to the Market Risk Management section, \"Asset-and-Liability Management Activities\" in our Management's Discussion and Analysis in this Form 10-K.\nWe assume significant credit risk to counterparties, many of which are major financial institutions. These financial institutions and other counterparties may also have substantial financial dependencies with other financial institutions and sovereign entities. These credit exposures and concentrations could expose us to financial loss.\nThe financial markets are characterized by extensive interdependencies among numerous parties, including banks, central banks, broker/dealers, insurance companies and other financial institutions. These financial institutions also include collective investment funds, such as mutual funds, UCITS and hedge funds that share these interdependencies. Many financial institutions, including collective investment funds, also hold, or are exposed to, loans, sovereign debt, fixed-income securities, derivatives, counterparty and other forms of credit risk in amounts that are material to their financial condition. As a result of our own business practices and these interdependencies, we and many of our clients have concentrated counterparty exposure to other financial institutions and collective investment funds, particularly large and complex institutions, sovereign issuers, mutual funds, UCITS and hedge funds. Although we have procedures for monitoring both individual and aggregate counterparty risk, significant individual and aggregate counterparty exposure is inherent in our business, as our focus is on servicing large institutional investors\n.\nIn the normal course of our business, we assume concentrated credit risk at the individual obligor, counterparty or group level. Such concentrations may be material and can often exceed 10% of our consolidated total shareholders' equity. Our material counterparty exposures change daily,\nState Street Corporation | 32\nand the counterparties or groups of related counterparties to which our risk exposure exceeds 10% of our consolidated total shareholders' equity are also variable during any reported period; however, our largest exposures tend to be to other financial institutions.\nConcentration of counterparty exposure presents significant risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of our counterparties (or in some cases of our clients' counterparties) has the potential to expose us to risk of financial loss. Changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions or sovereign issuers can occur rapidly, are often based on a variety of factors and are difficult to predict.\nThis was observed during the financial crisis that began in 2007-2008, when economic, market, political and other factors contributed to the perception of many financial institutions and sovereign issuers as being less credit worthy. This led to credit downgrades of numerous large U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions and several sovereign issuers (which exposure stressed the perceived creditworthiness of financial institutions, many of which invest in, accept collateral in the form of, or value other transactions based on the debt or other securities issued by sovereigns) and substantially reduced value and liquidity in the market for their credit instruments.  These or other factors could again contribute to similar consequences or other market risks associated with reduced levels of liquidity. As a result, we may be exposed to increased counterparty risks, either resulting from our role as principal or because of commitments we make in our capacity as agent for some of our clients.\nAdditional areas where we experience exposure to credit risk include:\n•\nShort-term credit\n. The degree of client demand for short-term credit tends to increase during periods of market turbulence, which may expose us to further counterparty-related risks. For example, investors in collective investment vehicles for which we act as custodian may experience significant redemption activity due to adverse market or economic news. Our relationship with our clients and the nature of the settlement process for some types of payments may result in the extension of short-term credit in such circumstances. We also provide committed lines of credit to support such activity. For some types of clients, we provide credit to allow them to leverage their portfolios, which may expose us to potential loss if the client experiences investment losses or other credit difficulties.\n•\nIndustry and country risks\n. In addition to our exposure to financial institutions, we are from time to time exposed to concentrated credit risk at an industry or country level. This concentration risk also applies to groups of unrelated counterparties that may have similar investment strategies involving one or more particular industries, regions, or other characteristics. These unrelated counterparties may concurrently experience adverse effects to their performance, liquidity or reputation due to events or other factors affecting such investment strategies. Though potentially not material individually (relative to any one such counterparty), our credit exposures to such a group of counterparties could expose us to a single market or political event or a correlated set of events that, in the aggregate, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\n•\nSubcustodian risks\n. Our use of unaffiliated subcustodians exposes us to credit risk, in addition to other risks, such as operational risk, dependencies on credit extensions and risks of the legal systems of the jurisdictions in which the subcustodians operate, each of which may be material. Our operating model exposes us to risk of unaffiliated sub-custodians to a degree greater than some of our competitors who have banking operations in more jurisdictions than we do. Our sub-custodians operate in all jurisdictions in which our clients invest, including emerging and other underdeveloped markets that entail heightened risks. These risks are amplified due to evolving regulatory requirements with respect to our financial exposures in the event those subcustodians are unable to return clients’ assets, including, in some regulatory regimes, such as the E.U.'s UCITS V directive, requirements that we be responsible for resulting losses suffered by our clients. We may agree to similar or more stringent standards with clients that are not subject to such regulations. Our subcustodians are also large, global financial institutions with whom we have other credit exposures. This credit exposure to these financial institutions or subcustodians may limit the financial relationship we may have with these counterparties.\n•\nSettlement risks\n. We are exposed to settlement risks, particularly in our payments and foreign exchange activities. Those activities may lead to extension of credit and consequent losses in the event of a\nState Street Corporation | 33\ncounterparty breach or an operational error, including the failure to provide credit. Due to our membership in several industry clearing or settlement exchanges, we may be required to guarantee obligations and liabilities, or provide financial support, in the event that other members do not honor their obligations or default. Moreover, not all of our counterparty exposure is secured, and even when our exposure is secured, the realizable value of the collateral may have declined by the time we exercise our rights against that collateral. This risk may be particularly acute if we are required to sell the collateral into an illiquid or temporarily-impaired market or with respect to clients protected by sovereign immunity. We are exposed to risk of short-term credit or overdraft of our clients in connection with the process to facilitate settlement of trades and related foreign exchange activities, particularly when contractual settlement has been agreed with our clients. The occurrence of overdrafts at peak volatility could create significant credit exposure to our clients depending upon the value of such clients' collateral at the time.\n•\nSecurities lending and repurchase agreement indemnification\n. On behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In the event of a failure of the borrower to return such securities, we typically agree to indemnify our clients for the amount by which the fair market value of those securities exceeds the proceeds of the disposition of the collateral posted by the borrower in connection with such transaction. We also lend and borrow securities as riskless principal, and in connection with those transactions receive a security interest in securities held by the borrowers in their securities portfolios and advance cash or securities as collateral to securities lenders. Borrowers are generally required to provide collateral equal to a contractually agreed percentage equal to or in excess of the fair market value of the loaned securities. As the fair market value of the loaned securities or collateral changes, additional collateral is provided by the borrower or collateral is returned to the borrower. In addition, our agency securities lending clients often purchase securities or other financial instruments from financial counterparties, including broker/dealers, under repurchase arrangements, frequently as a method of reinvesting the cash collateral they receive from lending their securities.\nUnder these arrangements, the counterparty is obligated to repurchase these securities or financial instruments from the client at the same price (plus an agreed rate of return) at some point in the future. The value of the collateral is intended to exceed the counterparty's payment obligation, and collateral is adjusted daily to account for shortfall under, or excess over, the agreed-upon collateralization level. As with the securities lending program, we agree to indemnify our clients from any loss that would arise on a default by the counterparty under these repurchase arrangements if the proceeds from the disposition of the securities or other financial assets held as collateral are less than the amount of the repayment obligation by the client's counterparty. In such instances of counterparty default, for both securities lending and repurchase agreements, we, rather than our client, are exposed to the risks associated with collateral value.\n•\nRepurchase and resale transactions\n. We enter into repurchase and resale transactions in eligible securities with sponsored clients and with other FICC members and, pursuant to FICC Government Securities Division rules, submit, novate and net the transactions. We may sponsor clients to clear their eligible repurchase transactions with FICC, backed by our guarantee to FICC of the prompt and full payment and performance of our sponsored member clients’ respective obligations. Although we obtain a security interest from our sponsored clients in the collateral that they receive, we are exposed to the associated risks, including insufficiency of the value of collateral.\n•\nStable value arrangements\n. We enter into stable value wrap derivative contracts with unaffiliated stable value funds that allow a stable value fund to provide book value coverage to its participants. During the 2008 financial crisis, the book value of obligations under many of these contracts exceeded the market value of the underlying portfolio holdings. Concerns regarding the portfolio of investments protected by such contracts, or regarding the investment manager overseeing such an investment option, may result in redemption demands from stable value products covered by benefit-responsive contracts at a time when the portfolio's market value is less than its book value, potentially exposing us to risk of loss.\nState Street Corporation | 34\n•\nPrivate equity subscription finance credit facilities.\nWe provide credit facilities to private equity funds. The portfolio consists of capital call lines of credit, the repayment of which is dependent on the receipt of capital calls from the underlying limited partner investors in the funds managed by these firms.\n•\nU.S. municipal obligations remarketing credit facilities\n. We provide credit facilities in connection with the remarketing of U.S. municipal obligations, potentially exposing us to credit exposure to the municipalities issuing such bonds and contingent liquidity risk.\n•\nLeveraged loans\n. In recent years, we have increased our investment in leveraged loans, both in the U.S. and in Europe. We invest in these loans to non-investment grade borrowers through participation in loan syndications in the non-investment grade lending market. We rate these loans as \"speculative\" under our internal risk-rating framework, and these loans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to higher-rated loans. We are therefore at a higher risk of default with respect to these investments relative to other of our investments activities. In addition, unlike other financial institutions that may have an active role in managing individual loan compliance, our investment in these loans is generally as a passive investor with limited control. As this portfolio grows and becomes more seasoned, our allowance for credit losses related to these loans may increase through additional provisions for credit losses.\n•\nCommercial Real Estate.\nWe finance commercial and multi-family properties, which serve as collateral for our loans. Although collateralized, these loans may become under-secured if the value of the collateral was over-estimated or changes. Loan payments are dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying collateral property to generate sufficient cash flow to repay the loan in a timely fashion. A material decline in real estate markets or economic conditions could negatively impact value or property performance, which could adversely impact timely loan repayment, which may result in increased provision for credit losses on loans, and actual losses, either of which would have an adverse impact on our net income. We seek to minimize these risks by maintaining lending policies and procedures and underwriting standards, however, there can be no assurance that\nthese will protect us from credit-related losses or delinquencies.\n•\nUnavailability of netting\n. We are generally not able to net exposures across counterparties that are affiliated entities and may not be able in all circumstances to net exposures to the same legal entity across multiple products. As a consequence, we may incur a loss in relation to one entity or product even though our exposure to an entity's affiliates or across product types is over-collateralized. In some cases, for example in our securities finance and foreign exchange activities, we are able to enter into netting agreements that allow us to net offsetting exposures and payment obligations against one another.  In the event we become unable, due to operational constraints, actions by regulators, changes in accounting principles, law or regulation (or related interpretations) or other factors, to net some or all of our offsetting exposures and payment obligations under those agreements, we would be required to gross up our assets and liabilities on our statement of condition and our calculation of RWA, accordingly.  This would result in a potentially material increase in our regulatory ratios, including LCR, and present increased credit, liquidity, asset-and-liability management and operational risks, some of which could be material.\nUnder currently prevailing regulatory restrictions on credit exposure we are required to limit our exposures to specific issuers or counterparties or groups of counterparties, including financial institutions and sovereign issuers. These credit exposure restrictions have and may further adversely affect certain of our businesses, may require that we expand our credit exposure to a broader range of issuers and counterparties, including issuers and counterparties that represent increased credit risk, may reduce or foreclose our ability to enter into advantageous transactions or ventures with particular counterparties and may require that we modify our operating models or the policies and practices we use to manage our consolidated statement of condition. The effects of these considerations may increase when evaluated under a stressed environment in stress testing, including CCAR. In addition, we are an adherent to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association 2015 Universal Resolution Stay Protocol and as such are subject to restrictions against the exercise of rights and remedies against fellow adherents, including other major financial institutions, in the event they or an affiliate of theirs enters into resolution. Although our overall business is subject to these factors, several of our activities are particularly\nState Street Corporation | 35\nsensitive to them including our currency trading business and our securities finance business.\nGiven the limited number of strong counterparties in the current market, we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients' counterparty credit risk.\nFee revenue represents a significant majority of our consolidated revenue and is subject to decline, among other things, in the event of a reduction in, or changes to, the level or type of investment activity by our clients.\nWe rely primarily on fee-based services to derive our revenue. This contrasts with commercial banks that may rely more heavily on interest-based sources of revenue, such as loans. During 2020 total fee revenue represented approximately 81% of our total revenue. Fee revenue generated by our Investment Servicing and Investment Management businesses is augmented by foreign exchange trading services, securities finance and software and processing fee revenue. The level of these fees is influenced by several factors, including the mix and volume of our AUC/A and our AUM, the value and type of securities positions held (with respect to assets under custody) and the volume of our clients' portfolio transactions, and the types of products and services used by our clients.\nIn addition, our clients include institutional investors, such as mutual funds, collective investment funds, UCITS, hedge funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations, endowments and investment managers. Economic, market or other factors that reduce the level or rates of savings in or with those institutions, either through reductions in financial asset valuations or through changes in investor preferences, could materially reduce our fee revenue and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our capital and liquidity, including by continuously attracting deposits and other short-term funding, our consolidated financial condition, including our regulatory capital ratios, our consolidated results of operations and our business prospects, could be adversely affected.\nLiquidity management, including on an intra-day basis, is critical to the management of our consolidated statement of condition and to our ability to service our client base. We generally use our liquidity to:\n•\nmeet clients' demands for return of their deposits;\n•\nextend credit to our clients in connection with our investor services businesses; and\n•\nfund the pool of long- and intermediate-term assets that are included in the investment securities and loan portfolio carried in our consolidated statement of condition.\nBecause the demand for credit by our clients, particularly settlement related extensions of credit, is difficult to predict and control, and may be at its peak at times of disruption in the securities markets, and because the average maturity of our investment securities and loan portfolios is longer than the contractual maturity of our client deposit base, we need to continuously attract, and are dependent on access to, various sources of short-term funding. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the level of client deposits held by us has tended to increase during times of market disruption; however, since such deposits are considered to be transitory, we have historically deposited so-called excess deposits with U.S. and non-U.S. central banks and in other highly liquid but low-yielding instruments. These levels of excess client deposits, when they manifest, have increased our NII but have adversely affected our NIM.\nIn managing our liquidity, our primary source of short-term funding is client deposits, which are predominantly transaction-based deposits by institutional investors. Our ability to continue to attract these deposits, and other short-term funding sources such as certificates of deposit, is subject to variability based on a number of factors, including volume and volatility in global financial markets, the interest rates that we are prepared to pay for these deposits, the loss or gain of one or more clients, client interest in reducing non-interest bearing deposits, the perception of safety of these deposits or short-term obligations relative to alternative short-term investments available to our clients, including the capital markets, and the classification of certain deposits for regulatory purposes and related discussions we may have from time to time with clients regarding better balancing our clients' cash management needs with our economic and regulatory objectives.\nThe Parent Company is a non-operating holding company and generally maintains only limited cash and other liquid resources at any time primarily to meet anticipated near-term obligations. To effectively manage our liquidity we routinely transfer assets among affiliated entities, subsidiaries and branches. Internal or external factors, such as regulatory requirements and standards, including resolution planning and restrictions on dividend distributions, influence our liquidity management and may limit our ability to effectively transfer liquidity internally which could, among other things, restrict our ability to fund operations, dividends or stock repurchases or pay interest on debt securities or require us to seek\nState Street Corporation | 36\nexternal and potentially more costly capital and impact our liquidity position.\nIn addition, while not obligations of ours, the investment products that we manage for third parties may be exposed to liquidity risks. These products may be funded on a short-term basis or the clients participating in these products may have a right to the return of cash or assets on limited notice. These business activities include, among others, securities finance collateral pools, money market and other short-term investment funds and liquidity facilities utilized in connection with municipal bond programs. If clients demand a return of their cash or assets, particularly on limited notice, and these investment pools do not have the liquidity to support those demands, we could be forced to sell investment securities held by these asset pools at unfavorable prices, damaging our reputation as a service provider and potentially exposing us to claims related to our management of the pools.\nThe availability and cost of credit in short-term markets are highly dependent on the markets' perception of our liquidity and creditworthiness. Our efforts to monitor and manage our liquidity risk, including on an intra-day basis, may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or unanticipated changes in the global securities markets or other event-driven reductions in liquidity. As a result of such events, among other things, our cost of funds may increase, thereby reducing our NII, or we may need to dispose of a portion of our investment securities portfolio, which, depending on market conditions, could result in a loss from such sales of investment securities being recorded in our consolidated statement of income.\nWe may need to raise additional capital or debt in the future, which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms.\nWe may need to raise additional capital or debt in order to maintain our credit ratings, in response to regulatory changes, including capital rules, or for other purposes, including financing acquisitions and joint ventures. For example, in November 2019, January 2020 and March 2020, we issued additional long-term debt in order to maintain levels to satisfy internal and regulatory requirements, and in September 2018 and July 2018 we issued preferred stock and common stock, respectively, to finance our acquisition of CRD.\nHowever, our ability to access the capital markets, if needed, on a timely basis or at all will depend on a number of factors, such as the state of the financial markets and securities law requirements and standards. In the event of rising interest rates, disruptions in financial markets, negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength, or other factors that would increase our cost of borrowing, we\ncannot be sure of our ability to raise additional capital or debt, if needed, on terms acceptable to us. Any diminished ability to raise additional capital or debt, if needed, could adversely affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan, capital plan and strategic goals, including the financing of acquisitions and joint ventures and our efforts to maintain regulatory compliance.\nAny downgrades in our credit ratings, or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength, could adversely affect our borrowing costs, capital costs and liquidity position and cause reputational harm.\nMajor independent rating agencies publish credit ratings for our debt obligations based on their evaluation of a number of factors, some of which relate to our performance and other corporate developments, including financings, acquisitions and joint ventures, and some of which relate to general industry conditions. We anticipate that the rating agencies will continue to review our ratings regularly based on our consolidated results of operations and developments in our businesses, including regulatory considerations such as resolution planning. One or more of the major independent credit rating agencies have in the past downgraded, and may in the future downgrade, our credit ratings, or have negatively revised their outlook for our credit ratings. The current market and regulatory environment and our exposure to financial institutions and other counterparties, including sovereign entities, increase the risk that we may not maintain our current ratings, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to maintain our current credit ratings. Downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our borrowing costs, our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. A failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating may also preclude us from being competitive in various products.\nAdditionally, our counterparties, as well as our clients, rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us. If we experience diminished financial strength or stability, actual or perceived, due to the effects of market or regulatory developments, announced or rumored business developments, consolidated results of operations, a decline in our stock price or a downgrade to our credit rating, our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions, secured or unsecured, with us, our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of service we provide to them or seek to transfer the business, in whole or in part, to other service providers or our prospective clients may select other service providers.  Any or, all of these may have adverse effects on our business and reputation.\nState Street Corporation | 37\nThe risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy than other market participants is higher as a result of recent market developments, which include an environment in which the consolidation, and in some instances failure, of financial institutions, including major global financial institutions, has resulted in a smaller number of much larger counterparties and competitors. If our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty, our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients, on our or our clients' behalf, will be materially compromised. If our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them, our revenues will decrease accordingly.\nCompliance and Regulatory Risks\nOur business and capital-related activities, including our ability to return capital to shareholders and repurchase our capital stock, may be adversely affected by our implementation of regulatory capital and liquidity standards that we must meet or as a result of regulatory capital stress testing.\nBasel III and Dodd-Frank Act\nWe are required to calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both the Basel III advanced approaches and the Basel III standardized approach, and we are subject to the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios calculated under the advanced approaches and those calculated under the standardized approach in the assessment of our capital adequacy.\nIn implementing various aspects of these capital regulations, we are making interpretations of the regulatory intent. The Federal Reserve may determine that we are not in compliance with the capital rules and may require us to take actions to come into compliance that could adversely affect our business operations, our regulatory capital structure, our capital ratios or our financial performance, or otherwise restrict our growth plans or strategies. In addition, banking regulators could change the Basel III rule or their interpretations as they apply to us, including changes to these standards or interpretations made in regulations implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which could adversely affect us and our ability to comply with the Basel III rule.\nAlong with the Basel III rule, banking regulators also introduced additional requirements, such as the SLR, LCR and the recently finalized NSFR, each of which presents compliance risks.\nFor example, the specification of the various elements of the NSFR in the final rule could have a material effect on our business activities, including the management and composition of our investment\nsecurities portfolio and our ability to extend credit through committed facilities, loans to our clients or our principal securities lending activities. In addition, further capital and liquidity requirements are being implemented or are under consideration by U.S. and international banking regulators. Any of these rules, or any additional regulatory initiatives introduced under the new administration, could have a material effect on our capital and liquidity planning and related activities, including the management and composition of our investment securities portfolio and our ability to extend committed contingent credit facilities to our clients. The full effects of these rules, and of other regulatory initiatives related to capital or liquidity, on us and State Street Bank are subject to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.\nSystemic Importance\nAs a G-SIB, we are generally subject to the most stringent provisions under the Basel III rule. For example, we are subject to the Federal Reserve's rules on the implementation of capital surcharges for U.S. G-SIBs, and on TLAC, LTD and clean holding company requirements for U.S. G-SIBs which we refer to as the \"TLAC rule\". For additional information on these requirements, refer to the “Regulatory Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards” section under “Supervision and Regulation” in Business in this Form 10-K.\nNot all of our competitors have similarly been designated as systemically important nor are all of them subject to the same degree of regulation as a bank or financial holding company, and therefore some of our competitors are not subject to the same additional capital requirements.\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\nWe are required by the Federal Reserve to conduct periodic stress testing of our business operations and to develop an annual capital plan as part of the Federal Reserve's CCAR process. The stress testing and CCAR processes, the severity and other characteristics of which may evolve from year-to-year, are used by the Federal Reserve to evaluate our management of capital and the adequacy of our regulatory capital and to determine the SCB that we must maintain above our minimum regulatory capital requirements in order for us to make capital distributions and discretionary bonuses without limitation. The results of the stress testing and CCAR processes are difficult to predict due, among other things, to the Federal Reserve's use of proprietary stress models that differ from our internal models. The results of the Federal Reserve’s supervisory stress tests may result in an increase in our SCB requirement. The amounts of the planned capital actions in our capital plan in any year, including stock repurchases and dividends, may be substantially reduced from the amounts included in prior capital\nState Street Corporation | 38\nplans. These reductions may reflect changes in one or more different factors, including our business prospects and related capital needs, our capital position, proposed acquisitions or other uses of capital, the models used in our capital planning process, the supervisory models used by the Federal Reserve to stress our balance sheet, the Federal Reserve’s hypothetical economic scenarios for the CCAR process, the Federal Reserve’s CCAR instructions and the Federal Reserve’s supervisory expectations for the capital planning process. Any of these potential events could require  us, as applicable, to revise our stress-testing or capital management approaches, resubmit our capital plan or postpone, cancel or alter our planned capital actions. In addition, changes in our business strategy, merger or acquisition activity or uses of capital could result in a change in our capital plan and its associated capital actions, and may require us to resubmit our capital plan to the Federal Reserve and recalculate our SCB requirement. We are also subject to asset quality reviews and stress testing by the ECB and in the future we may be subject to similar reviews and testing by other regulators.\nOur implementation of capital and liquidity requirements, including our capital plan, may not be approved or may be objected to by the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve may impose capital requirements in excess of our expectations or require us to maintain levels of liquidity that are higher than we may expect and which may adversely affect our consolidated revenues. In the event that our implementation of capital and liquidity requirements under regulatory initiatives or our current capital structure are determined not to conform with current and future capital requirements, our ability to deploy capital in the operation of our business or our ability to distribute capital to shareholders or to repurchase our capital stock may be constrained, and our business may be adversely affected. In addition, we may choose to forgo business opportunities, due to their impact on our capital plan or stress tests, including CCAR and our SCB requirement. Likewise, in the event that regulators in other jurisdictions in which we have banking subsidiaries determine that our capital or liquidity levels do not conform with current and future regulatory requirements, our ability to deploy capital, our levels of liquidity or our business operations in those jurisdictions may be adversely affected.\nFor additional information about the above matters, refer to “Regulatory Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards” section under \"Supervision and Regulation\" in Business and “Capital” section under \"Financial Condition\" in our Management's Discussion and Analysis in this Form 10-K.\nWe face extensive and changing government regulation in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions\nin which we operate, which may increase our costs and expose us to risks related to compliance.\nMost of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by multiple regulatory bodies, and many of the clients to which we provide services are themselves subject to a broad range of regulatory requirements. These regulations may affect the scope of, and the manner and terms of delivery of, our services. As a financial institution with substantial international operations, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervisory oversight, both inside and outside of the U.S. This regulation and supervisory oversight affects, among other things, the scope of our activities and client services, our capital and organizational structure, our ability to fund the operations of our subsidiaries, our lending practices, our dividend policy, our common stock purchase actions, the manner in which we market our services, our acquisition activities and our interactions with foreign regulatory agencies and officials.\nIn particular, we are registered with the Federal Reserve as a bank holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The Bank Holding Company Act generally limits the activities in which we and our non-banking subsidiaries may engage to managing or controlling banks and to activities considered to be closely related to banking. As a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, we and some of our non-banking subsidiaries may also engage in a broader range of activities considered to be “financial in nature.” Financial holding company status may be denied if we and our banking subsidiaries do not remain well capitalized and well managed or fail to comply with Community Reinvestment Act obligations. Currently, under the Bank Holding Company Act, we may not be able to engage in new activities or acquire shares or control of other businesses.\nWe are unable to predict what, if any, changes to the regulatory environment may be enacted by Congress, both chambers of which are now under Democratic control, or the new presidential administration and what the impact of any such changes will be on our results of operations or financial condition, including increased expenses or changes in the demand for our services or our ability to engage in transactions to expand our business, or on the U.S.-domestic or global economies or financial markets.\nMoreover, the turnover of the presidential administration is expected to result in certain changes in the leadership and senior staffs of the federal banking agencies. Such changes are likely to impact the rulemaking, supervision, examination and enforcement priorities and policies of the agencies.\nState Street Corporation | 39\nThe potential impact of any changes in agency personnel, policies and priorities on the financial services sector, including us, cannot be predicted at this time.\nWe expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision. Several other aspects of the regulatory environment in which we operate, and related risks, are discussed below. Additional information is provided under \"Supervision and Regulation” in Business in this Form 10-K.\nResolution Planning\nWe are required to periodically submit a plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure commonly referred to as a resolution plan or a living will to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC under Section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act. Through resolution planning, we seek, in the event of insolvency, to maintain State Street Bank’s role as a key infrastructure provider within the financial system, while minimizing risk to the financial system and maximizing value for the benefit of our stakeholders. Significant management attention and resources are required in an effort to meet regulatory expectations with respect to resolution planning.\nIn the event of material financial distress or failure, our preferred resolution strategy is the SPOE Strategy. Our resolution plan, including our implementation of the SPOE Strategy with a secured support agreement, involves important risks, including that: (1) the SPOE Strategy and the obligations under the related secured support agreement may result in the recapitalization of and/or provision of liquidity to State Street Bank and our other material entities and the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the Parent Company at an earlier stage of financial stress than might otherwise occur without such mechanisms in place; (2) an expected effect of the SPOE Strategy, together with applicable TLAC regulatory requirements, is that our losses will be imposed on Parent Company shareholders and the holders of long-term debt and other forms of TLAC securities currently outstanding or issued in the future by the Parent Company, as well as on any other Parent Company creditors, before any of our losses are imposed on the holders of the debt securities of State Street Bank or certain of the Parent Company’s other operating subsidiaries or any of their depositors or creditors and before U.S. taxpayers are put at risk; (3) there can be no assurance that there would be sufficient recapitalization resources available to ensure that State Street Bank and our other material entities are adequately capitalized following the triggering of the requirements to provide capital and/or liquidity under the support agreement; and (4) there can be no assurance that credit rating agencies, in response to our resolution plan or the support agreement, will not downgrade, place on negative watch or change their outlook on our debt credit\nratings, generally or on specific debt securities. Additional information about the SPOE Strategy, including related risks, is provided under \"Recovery and Resolution Planning\" in Business in this Form 10-K\n.\nSystemic Importance\nOur qualification in the U.S. as a SIFI, and our designation by the Financial Stability Board as a G-SIB, to which certain regulatory capital surcharges may apply, subjects us to incrementally higher capital and prudential requirements, increased scrutiny of our activities and potential additional regulatory requirements or heightened regulatory expectations as compared to those applicable to some of the financial institutions with which we compete as a custodian or asset manager. This qualification and designation also has significantly increased, and may continue to increase, our expenses associated with regulatory compliance, including personnel and systems, as well as implementation and related costs to enhance our programs.\nGlobal and Non-U.S. Regulatory Requirements\nThe breadth of our business activities, together with the scope of our global operations and varying business practices in relevant jurisdictions, increase the complexity and costs of meeting our regulatory compliance obligations, including in areas that are receiving significant regulatory scrutiny. We are, therefore, subject to related risks of non-compliance, including fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions, difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals, limitations on our business activities or reputational harm, any of which may be significant. For example, the global nature of our client base requires us to comply with complex laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions relating to economic sanctions and money laundering. In addition, we are required to comply not only with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, but also with the applicable anti-corruption laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate. Further, our global operating model requires that we comply with information security, resiliency and outsourcing oversight requirements, including with respect to affiliated entities, of multiple jurisdictions and enable our clients to comply with information security, resiliency and outsourcing oversight requirements  imposed upon them. Regulatory scrutiny of compliance with these and other laws and regulations is increasing and may, in some respects, impede the implementation of our global operating model that is central to both delivery of client service requirements and cost efficiency. We sometimes face inconsistent laws and regulations across the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The evolving regulatory landscape may interfere with our ability to conduct our operations, with our pursuit of a common global operating model or with our ability to compete effectively with other financial\nState Street Corporation | 40\ninstitutions operating in those jurisdictions or which may be subject to different regulatory requirements than apply to us. In particular, non-U.S. regulations and initiatives that may be inconsistent or conflict with current or proposed regulations in the U.S. could create increased compliance and other costs that would adversely affect our business, operations or profitability. Geopolitical events such as the U.K.’s exit from the European Union also have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of regulatory compliance.\nIn addition to U.S. regulatory initiatives, we are further affected by non-U.S. regulatory initiatives, including the implementation of the finalized Basel prudential framework and the European Commission’s Investment Firm Review and Central Securities Depositories Regulation, as well as proposals for a review of the AIFM Directive and proposals under the Capital Markets Union Action Plan. Recent, proposed or potential regulations in the U.S. and E.U. with respect to short-term wholesale funding, such as repurchase agreements or securities lending, or other non-bank finance activities, could also adversely affect not only our own operations but also the operations of the clients to which we provide services. Concerns regarding the liquidity and valuation of prime money market funds and similar products may adversely impact the cash management products we offer. In addition, anti-competitive, voting power, governance and other concerns with passive investment strategies continue to be the subject of legislative and regulatory debate which could significantly impact both our asset management business and the clients that we service.\nConsequences of Regulatory Environment and Compliance Risks\nDomestic and international regulatory reform could limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, increase our regulatory capital requirements, alter the risk profile of certain of our core activities and impose additional costs on us, otherwise adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations or financial condition and have other negative consequences, including, a reduction of our credit ratings. Different countries may respond to the market and economic environment in different and potentially conflicting manners, which could increase the cost of compliance for us.\nThe evolving regulatory environment, including changes to existing regulations and the introduction of new regulations, may also contribute to decisions we may make to suspend, reduce or withdraw from existing businesses, activities, markets or initiatives. In addition to potential lost revenue associated with any such suspensions, reductions or withdrawals, any such suspensions, reductions or withdrawals may\nresult in significant restructuring or related costs or exposures.\nIf we do not comply with governmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits, delays, or difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals or restrictions on our business activities or harm to our reputation, which may significantly and adversely affect our business operations and, in turn, our consolidated results of operations. The willingness of regulatory authorities to impose meaningful sanctions, and the level of fines and penalties imposed in connection with regulatory violations, have increased substantially since the 2008 financial crisis. Regulatory agencies may, at times, limit our ability to disclose their findings, related actions or remedial measures. Similarly, many of our clients are subject to significant regulatory requirements and retain our services in order for us to assist them in complying with those legal requirements. Changes in these regulations can significantly affect the services that we are asked to provide, as well as our costs.\nAdverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our ability to attract and retain clients. If we cause clients to fail to comply with any regulatory requirements, we may be liable to them for losses and expenses that they incur. In recent years, regulatory oversight and enforcement have increased substantially, imposing additional costs and increasing the potential risks associated with our operations. If this regulatory trend continues, it could continue to adversely affect our operations and, in turn, our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nFor additional information, see the risk factor\n“Our businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and litigation.”\nWe are subject to enhanced external oversight as a result of certain agreements entered into in connection with the resolution of prior regulatory or governmental matters.\nIn connection with the resolution of certain proceedings relating to our having charged six clients of our transition management business during 2010 and 2011 amounts in excess of the contractual terms, in January 2017, we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice and the United States Attorney for the DOJ under which we agreed to retain an independent compliance and ethics monitor for a term which has now been extended to 2021 (subject to further extension) to, among other things, review and monitor the effectiveness of our compliance controls and business ethics and make related recommendations, and in September 2017, we entered into a settlement\nState Street Corporation | 41\nagreement with the SEC that also requires us to retain an independent ethics and compliance consultant. We have retained a monitor who is fulfilling our obligations under both the deferred prosecution agreement and the SEC settlement. Responding to the monitor's requests entails significant cost and management attention and we are, in general, required to implement remediation plans to address any of the monitor's recommendations. These recommendations may require substantial cost and effort to remediate and, even when consistent with our own control enhancement objectives, may reflect differences in approach, timing and cost than we may independently intend. Under the deferred prosecution agreement we also have a heightened obligation promptly to report issues involving potential or alleged fraudulent activities to the DOJ.\nAs a result of the enhanced inspections and monitoring activities to which we are subject under these agreements, governmental authorities may identify areas in which we may need to take actions, which may be significant, to enhance our regulatory compliance or risk management practices. Such remedial actions may entail significant cost, management attention, and systems development and such efforts may affect our ability to expand our business until such remedial actions are completed. These actions may be in addition to remedial measures required by the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators following examinations as a result of increased prudential expectations regarding our compliance programs, culture and risk management. Our failure to implement enhanced compliance and risk management procedures in a manner and in a time frame deemed to be responsive by the applicable regulatory authority could adversely impact our relationship with such regulatory authority and could lead to restrictions on our activities or other sanctions. Moreover, the identification of new or additional facts and circumstances suggesting inappropriate or non-compliant conduct, whether identified by the monitor or a regulatory authority, in the course of an inspection, or independently by us could lead to new governmental proceedings or the re-opening of matters that were previously resolved. The presence of the monitor, as well as governmental programs rewarding whistleblowing, may also increase the instances of current or former employees alleging that certain practices are inconsistent with our legal or regulatory obligations.\nOur businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and litigation.\nThe businesses in which we operate are highly-regulated and subject to extensive external scrutiny that may be directed generally to participants in the businesses or markets in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us, including as a\nresult of whistleblower and qui tam claims. In the course of our business, we are frequently subject to various regulatory, governmental and law enforcement inquiries, investigative demands and subpoenas, and from time to time, our clients, or the government on its own behalf or on behalf of our clients or others, make claims and take legal action relating to, among other things, our performance of our fiduciary, contractual or regulatory responsibilities. Often, the announcement of any such matters, or of any settlement of a claim or action, whether it involves us or others in our industry, may spur the initiation of similar claims by other clients or governmental parties. Regulatory authorities have, and are likely to continue to, initiate cross industry reviews when a material issue is identified at a financial institution. Such inquiries involve costs and management time and may lead to proceedings relating to our own activities.\nRegardless of the outcome of any governmental enforcement or litigation matter, responding to such matters is time-consuming and expensive and can divert the attention of senior management. Governmental enforcement and litigation matters can involve claims for disgorgement, demands for substantial monetary damages, the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, and the imposition of remedial sanctions or other required changes in our business practices, any of which could result in increased expenses, loss of client demand for our products or services, or harm to our reputation. The exposure associated with any proceedings that may be threatened, commenced or filed against us could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which we establish a reserve with respect to such potential liability or upon our reputation. In government settlements since the 2008 financial crisis, the fines imposed by authorities have increased substantially and may exceed in some cases the profit earned or harm caused by the regulatory or other breach. For example, in connection with the resolution of the transition management matter, we agreed to pay a fine of £22.9 million (approximately $37.8 million) to the U.K. FCA in 2014 and fines of $32.3 million to each of the DOJ and the SEC in 2017. As a further example, we paid an aggregate of $575 million in 2016 to resolve a series of investigations and governmental and private claims alleging that our indirect foreign exchange rates prior to 2008 were not adequately disclosed or were otherwise improper. These matters have also resulted in regulatory focus on the manner in which we charge clients and related disclosures. This focus may lead to increased and prolonged governmental inquiries and client, qui tam and whistleblower claims associated with the amount and disclosure of compensation we receive for our products and services.\nState Street Corporation | 42\nMoreover, U.S. and certain international governmental authorities have increasingly brought criminal actions against financial institutions, and criminal prosecutors have increasingly sought and obtained criminal guilty pleas, deferred prosecution agreements or other criminal sanctions from financial institutions. For example, in 2017 we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with the resolution of the transition management matter, and such agreement could increase the likelihood that governmental authorities will seek criminal sanctions against us in pending or future legal proceedings. See the risk factor “\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings relating to the manner in which we have invoiced certain expenses, and the outcome of such proceedings could materially adversely affect our results of operations, or harm our business or reputation\n.” Government authorities may also pursue criminal claims against current or former employees, and these matters can, among other things, involve continuing reputational harm to us.  For example, four of our former employees were indicted by U.S. prosecutors on charges of criminal conspiracy in connection with their involvement in the transition management matter. Two of these individuals pled guilty, and a third was convicted in 2018.\nIn many cases, we are required or may choose to report inappropriate or non-compliant conduct to the authorities, and our failure or delay to do so may represent an independent regulatory violation or be treated as an indication of non-cooperation with governmental authorities. Even when we promptly report a matter, we may nonetheless experience regulatory fines, liabilities to clients, harm to our reputation or other adverse effects. Moreover, our settlement or other resolution of any matter with any one or more regulators or other applicable party may not forestall other regulators or parties in the same or other jurisdictions from pursuing a claim or other action against us with respect to the same or a similar matter.\nFor more information about current contingencies relating to legal proceedings, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. The resolution of certain pending or potential legal or regulatory matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which the relevant matter is resolved or an accrual is determined to be required, on our consolidated financial condition or on our reputation.\nIn view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal and regulatory matters, we cannot provide assurance as to the outcome of any pending or potential matter or, if determined adversely against us, the costs associated with any such matter, particularly where the claimant seeks very large or\nindeterminate damages or where the matter presents novel legal theories, involves a large number of parties, involves the discretion of governmental authorities in seeking sanctions or negotiated resolution or is at a preliminary stage. We may be unable to accurately estimate our exposure to the risks of legal and regulatory contingencies when we record reserves for probable and estimable loss contingencies. As a result, any reserves we establish may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure. Similarly, our estimates of the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss for legal and regulatory contingencies are based upon then-available information and are subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the estimate at any time.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings relating to the manner in which we have invoiced certain expenses, and the outcome of such proceedings could materially adversely affect our results of operations or harm our business or reputation.\nIn 2015, we determined we had incorrectly invoiced clients for certain expenses. We have reimbursed most of our affected customers for those expenses, and we have implemented enhancements to our billing processes. In connection with our enhancements to our billing processes, we continue to review historical billing practices and may from time to time identify additional remediation. In 2017, we identified an additional area of incorrect expense billing associated with mailing services in our retirement services business. We currently expect the cumulative total of our payments to customers for these invoicing errors, including the error in the retirement services business, to be at least $370 million, all of which has been paid or is accrued. However, we may identify additional remediation costs. See the risk factor “\nOur efforts to improve our billing processes and practices are ongoing and may result in the identification of additional billing errors\n.”\nIn March 2017, a purported class action was commenced against us alleging that our invoicing practices violated duties owed to retirement plan customers under ERISA. In addition, we have received a purported class action demand letter alleging that our invoicing practices were unfair and deceptive under Massachusetts law. A class of customers, or particular customers, may assert that we have not paid to them all amounts incorrectly invoiced, and may seek double or treble damages under Massachusetts law.\nWe are also cooperating with investigations by governmental and regulatory authorities on these\nState Street Corporation | 43\nmatters, including the civil and criminal divisions of the DOJ and the DOL, which reviews could result in significant fines or other sanctions, civil and criminal, against us. In June 2019, we reached an agreement with the SEC to settle its claims that we violated the recordkeeping provisions of Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and caused violations of Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act and Rules 31a-1(a) and 31a-1(b) thereunder in connection with our overcharges of customers which are registered investment companies. In reaching this settlement, we neither admitted nor denied the claims contained in the SEC’s order, and agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $40 million. Also in June 2019, we reached an agreement with the Massachusetts Attorney General’s office to resolve its claims related to this matter. In reaching this settlement, we neither admitted nor denied the claims in the order, and agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $5.5 million. The costs associated with these settlements were within our related previously established accruals for loss contingencies. The SEC and Massachusetts Attorney General’s office settlements both recognize that the payment of $48.8 million in disgorgement and interest is satisfied by our direct reimbursements of our customers.\nIn January 2020, the DOJ outlined a framework for a possible resolution of their review. We are discussing the terms of a potential settlement of this matter with the DOJ. Separately, we have inquired of the DOL as to the status of their review but have not entered into settlement discussions with the DOL. There can be no assurance that any settlement with the DOJ or DOL will be reached on financial or other terms acceptable to us or at all. The aggregate amount of penalties that may potentially be imposed upon us in connection with the resolution of all outstanding investigations into our historical billing practices is not currently known. We have established a legal accrual with respect to the pending governmental investigations and civil litigation with respect to this matter; however, our ultimate liability with respect to this matter might be significantly in excess of our current accrual. Government authorities have significant discretion in criminal and civil matters as to the fines and other penalties they may seek to impose. Any resolution of the DOJ and DOL claims may involve penalties that could be a significant percentage, or a multiple of, all or a portion of the overcharge. The severity of such fines or penalties could take into account factors such as the amount or duration of our incorrect invoicing and the government’s or regulators’ assessment of the conduct of our employees, as well as prior conduct such as that which resulted in our January 2017 deferred prosecution agreement and settlement of civil claims regarding our indirect FX business.\nThe outcome of any of these proceedings and, in particular, any criminal sanction could materially adversely affect our results of operations and could have significant additional consequences for our business and reputation.\nOur efforts to improve our billing processes and practices are ongoing and may result in the identification of additional billing errors.\nIn 2015, we determined we had incorrectly invoiced some of our Investment Servicing clients for certain expenses. At that time, we began the process of remediating these errors, improving our billing processes and controls in the asset servicing business and other businesses, and testing these improved billing processes and controls. We are continuing to standardize, enhance, and, where necessary, replace and enhance controls and invest in new billing infrastructure. The objective of this billing transformation program is to obtain greater billing accuracy and timeliness. Because of the scale of our business, identifying and remediating all weaknesses and inefficiencies in our billing processes cannot be implemented concurrently. Accordingly, the costs to remediate billing errors which may be discovered in that process, would likely be incurred over a period that we are now unable accurately to determine. As we work through this process, we have discovered and may continue to discover areas where we believe our billing processes need improvement, where we believe we have made billing errors with respect to particular customers and categories of fees and expenses, and where we believe billing arrangements between ourselves and particular customers should be clarified. Such discoveries may lead to increased expense and decreased revenues, the need to remediate prior billing errors, government investigations, or litigation that may materially impact our business, financial results and reputation.\nAny theft, loss, damage to or other misappropriation or inadvertent disclosure of, or inappropriate access to, the confidential information we possess could have an adverse impact on our business and could subject us to regulatory actions, litigation and other adverse effects.\nOur businesses and relationships with clients are dependent on our ability to maintain the confidentiality of our and our clients' trade secrets and other confidential information (including client transactional and holdings data and personal data about our clients, our clients' clients and our employees). Unauthorized access, or failure of our controls with respect to granting access to our systems, has in the past occurred and may in the future occur, resulting in theft, loss, damage to or other misappropriation of such information. In\nState Street Corporation | 44\naddition, our and our vendors’ personnel have in the past and may in the future inadvertently or deliberately disclose client or other confidential information. Any theft, loss, damage to other misappropriation or inadvertent disclosure of confidential information could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position, our relationships with our clients and our reputation and could subject us to regulatory inquiries, enforcement and fines, civil litigation and possible financial liability or costs. To the extent any of these events involve personal information, the risks of enhanced regulatory scrutiny and the potential financial liabilities are exacerbated, particularly under data protection regulations such as the GDPR.\nOur calculations of credit, market and operational risk exposures, total RWA and capital ratios for regulatory purposes depend on data inputs, formulae, models, correlations and assumptions that are subject to change over time, which changes, in addition to our consolidated financial results, could materially impact our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios from period to period.\nTo calculate our credit, market and operational risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios for regulatory purposes, the Basel III rule involves the use of current and historical data, including our own loss data and similar information from other industry participants, market volatility measures, interest rates and spreads, asset valuations, credit exposures and the creditworthiness of our counterparties. These calculations also involve the use of quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and significant assumptions. We refer to the data, formulae, models, correlations and assumptions, as well as our related internal processes, as our “advanced systems.” While our advanced systems are generally quantitative in nature, significant components involve the exercise of judgment based on, among other factors, our and the financial services industry's evolving experience. Any of these judgments or other elements of our advanced systems may not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended. Collectively, they represent only our estimate of associated risk.\nIn addition, our advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. For example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a\nrelated loss, could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios compared to prior periods. An operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, depending on the severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven Basel-defined UOM, and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular UOM. This change in our capital requirements could be without direct correlation to the effects of the loss event or the timing of such effects on our results of operations. Due to the influence of changes in our advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, specific to us or more general market, or individual financial institution-specific, activities or experiences, or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our credit, market and operational risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios calculated under the Basel III rule will change, and may be volatile, over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period.\nChanges in accounting standards may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\nNew accounting standards, or changes to existing accounting standards, resulting both from initiatives of the FASB as well as changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards potentially could affect our consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. These changes can materially affect how we record and report our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and other financial information. In some cases, we could elect, or be required, to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities, and, in some cases, the revision of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods. For additional information regarding changes in accounting standards, refer to the “Recent Accounting Developments” section of Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nChanges in tax laws, rules or regulations, challenges to our tax positions with respect to historical transactions, and changes in the composition of our pre-tax earnings may increase our effective tax rate and thus adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\nOur businesses can be directly or indirectly affected by new tax legislation, the expiration of existing tax laws or the interpretation of existing tax laws worldwide. The U.S. federal and state governments, including Massachusetts, and\nState Street Corporation | 45\njurisdictions around the world continue to review proposals to amend tax laws, rules and regulations applicable to our businesses that could have a negative impact on our capital or after-tax earnings.  In the normal course of our business, we are subject to review by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities.  A review by any such authority could result in an increase in our recorded tax liability.  In addition to the aforementioned risks, our effective tax rate is dependent on the nature and geographic composition of our pre-tax earnings and could be negatively affected by changes in these factors.\nThe market transition away from broad use of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as an interest rate benchmark may impose additional costs on us and may expose us to increased operational, model and financial risk.\nGlobally, regulators have advised large banks to assess the risks and to prepare for transition from LIBOR to alternative rates ahead of year end 2021. Our financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to adapt to market changes promptly, while avoiding increased related expenses or operational errors. Substantial risks and uncertainties are associated with the market transition away from the use of LIBOR as a critical interest rate benchmark used to determine amounts payable under, and the value of, financial instruments and contracts.\nDue to our dependencies on LIBOR, the failure or inability to timely plan and implement a LIBOR transition program to maintain operational continuity and minimize economic impact for our clients, ourselves and other stakeholders could negatively impact our business and financial performance. Those dependencies include LIBOR-based securities and loans held in our investment portfolio, LIBOR-based preferred stock and long-term debt issued by us and LIBOR-based client fee schedules and deposit pricing. Also, our internal models which support decision making and risk management will require adjustments, which may cause weaknesses in the underlying model, inadequate assumptions or lead to reliance on poor or inaccurate data.  Assets held by our customers in their investment portfolios or in the investment portfolios we manage for others have LIBOR-based terms. We need to enhance our processes and systems to account for the new alternative rates-based instruments as they come to market, the transition of LIBOR-based instruments to their fallback language and uncertainty as to how such instruments should be valued where such fallback language is unclear. These process and systems requirements could adversely impact our business, which in some instances is dependent on critical inputs from third parties, who themselves must timely adapt to the market changes and failure to implement the terms of those instruments in a manner consistent with customer expectation could\nlead to disputes and operational issues. Failure or perceived failure to adequately prepare for LIBOR transition could affect our ability to attract and retain clients. Uncertainty relative to external developments necessary for the market transition away from LIBOR but outside of our control could further increase the costs and risks of the transition for us or our subsidiaries and have an adverse impact on our operational and financial performance.\nOperational Risks\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, our risk management policies and procedures may be inadequate, and operational risks could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.\nWe have in the past failed and may in the future fail to identify and manage risks related to a variety of aspects of our business, including, but not limited to cyber-security, information technology risk, operational risk and resiliency, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, trading risk, fiduciary risk, legal and compliance risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. We have adopted various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risk. We cannot provide assurance that those controls, procedures, policies and systems are or will be adequate to identify and manage internal and external risks, including risks related to service providers, in our various businesses. The risk of individuals, either employees or contractors, engaging in conduct harmful or misleading to clients or to us, such as consciously circumventing established control mechanisms to exceed trading or investment management limitations, committing fraud or improperly selling products or services to clients, is particularly challenging to manage through a control framework. In addition, we are subject to increased resiliency risk, requiring continuous reinvestment, enhancement and improvement in and of our information technology and operational infrastructure, controls and personnel which may not be effectively or timely deployed or integrated. Moreover, the financial and reputational impact of control or conduct failures can be significant. Persistent or repeated issues with respect to controls, information technology and operational resiliency or individual conduct have raised and may in the future raise concerns among regulators regarding our culture, governance and control environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts to address such risks will be effective. While we seek to contractually limit our financial exposure to operational risk, the degree of protection that we are able to achieve varies, and our potential exposure may be greater than the revenue we anticipate that we will earn from servicing our clients.\nState Street Corporation | 46\nIn addition, our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving. We will need to make additional investments to develop the operational infrastructure and to enhance our compliance and risk management capabilities to support these businesses, which may increase the operating expenses of such businesses. Moreover, we may fail to identify or fully understand the implications of changes in our businesses or the financial markets and fail to adequately or timely enhance our risk framework to address those changes. To the extent that our risk framework is ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets, regulatory or industry requirements, technology and cyber-security developments, our businesses, our counterparties, clients or service providers or for other reasons, we could incur losses, suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations, and subject to regulatory inquiry or action against us.\nOperational risk is inherent in all of our business activities. As a leading provider of services to institutional investors, we provide a broad array of services, including research, investment management, trading services and investment servicing that expose us to operational risk. In addition, these services generate a broad array of complex and specialized servicing, confidentiality and fiduciary requirements, many of which involve the opportunity for human, systems or process errors. We face the risk that the control policies, procedures and systems we have established to comply with our operational or security requirements will fail, will be inadequate or will become outdated. We also face the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, employee supervision or monitoring mechanisms, service-provider processes or other systems or controls, which could materially affect our future consolidated results of operations. Given the volume and magnitude of transactions we process on a daily basis, operational losses represent a potentially significant financial risk for our business. Operational errors that result in us remitting funds to a failing or bankrupt entity may be irreversible, and may subject us to losses.\nWe may also be subject to disruptions from external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions, including information processing and financial market settlement functions. In addition, our clients, vendors and counterparties could suffer from such events. Should these events affect us, or the clients, vendors or counterparties with which we conduct business, our consolidated results of operations could be negatively affected. When we record balance sheet accruals for probable and estimable loss contingencies related to\noperational losses, we may be unable to accurately estimate our potential exposure, and any accruals we establish to cover operational losses may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.\nCost shifting to non-U.S. jurisdictions and outsourcing may expose us to increased operational risk and reputational harm and may not result in expected cost savings.\nWe manage expenses by migrating certain business processes and business support functions to lower-cost geographic locations, such as India, Poland and China, and by outsourcing to vendors and joint ventures in various jurisdictions. This effort exposes us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality, control and effective management or business resiliency within these operations during and after transitions. These migrations also involve risks that our outsourcing vendors or joint ventures may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations to us, including with respect to indemnification and information security, and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of outsourcing providers, joint ventures and other third parties. Our geographic footprint also exposes us to the relevant macroeconomic, political, legal and similar risks generally involved in doing business in the jurisdictions in which we establish lower-cost locations or joint ventures or in which our outsourcing vendors locate their operations, particularly in locations where we have a concentration of our operational activities, such as India, Poland and China. The increased elements of risk that arise from certain operating processes being conducted in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk. During periods of transition of operations, greater operational risk and client concerns exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery and business resiliency. The extent and pace at which we are able to move functions to lower-cost locations, joint ventures and outsourcing providers may also be affected by political, regulatory and client acceptance issues, including with respect to data use, storage and security. Such relocation or outsourcing of functions also entails costs, such as technology, real estate and restructuring expenses, which may offset or exceed the expected financial benefits of the relocation or outsourcing. In addition, the financial benefits of lower-cost locations and of outsourcings may diminish over time or could be offset in the event that the U.S. or other jurisdictions impose tax, trade barrier or other measures which seek to discourage the use of lower cost jurisdictions.\nState Street Corporation | 47\nAny failures of or damage to, attack on or unauthorized access to our information technology systems or facilities or disruptions to our continuous operations, including the systems, facilities or operations of third parties with which we do business, such as resulting from cyber-attacks, could result in significant costs,  reputational damage and limits on our ability to conduct our business activities.\nOur businesses depend on information technology infrastructure, both internal and external, to, among other things, record and process a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data, in many currencies, on a daily basis, across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions and to maintain that data securely. In recent years, several financial services firms have suffered successful cyber-attacks launched both domestically and from abroad, resulting in the disruption of services to clients, loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data and reputational harm. We also have been subjected to cyber-attacks, and although we have not to our knowledge suffered a material breach or suspension of our systems, it is possible that we could suffer such a breach or suspension in the future or that we may be unaware of a prior attack. Cyber-threats are sophisticated and continually evolving. We may not implement effective systems and other measures to effectively identify, detect, prevent, mitigate, recover from or remediate the full diversity of cyber-threats or improve and adapt such systems and measures as such threats evolve and advance.\nA cyber-security incident, or a failure to protect our technology infrastructure, systems and information and our clients and others' information against cyber-security threats, could result in the theft, loss, unauthorized access to, disclosure, misuse or alteration of information, system failures or outages or loss of access to information. The expectations of our clients and regulators with respect to the resiliency of our systems and the adequacy of our control environment with respect to such systems has and is expected to increase as the risk of cyber-attacks, which is presently elevated due to the current work-from-home environment, and the consequences of those attacks become more pronounced. We may not be successful in meeting those expectations or in our efforts to identify, detect, prevent, mitigate and respond to such cyber-incidents or for our systems to recover in a manner that does not disrupt our ability to provide services to our clients. The failure to maintain an adequate technology infrastructure and applications with effective cyber-security controls could impact operations, adversely affect our financial results, result in loss of business, damage our reputation or impact our ability to comply with regulatory obligations, leading to regulatory fines and\nsanctions. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify, investigate or remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from cyber-security threats.\nOur computer, communications, data processing, networks, backup, business continuity, disaster recovery or other operating, information or technology systems, facilities and activities have suffered and in the future may suffer disruptions or otherwise fail to operate properly or become disabled, overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which can adversely affect our ability to process transactions, provide services or maintain systems availability, maintain information security, compliance and internal controls or otherwise appropriately conduct our business activities. For example, in addition to cyber-attacks, there could be sudden increases in transaction or data volumes, electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters, or employee or contractor error or malfeasance. Third parties may also attempt to place individuals within State Street or fraudulently induce employees, vendors, clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our clients or other parties. Any such disruptions or failures may require us, among other things, to reconstruct lost data (which may not be possible), reimburse our clients' costs associated with such disruption or failure, result in loss of client business or damage our information technology infrastructure or systems or those of our clients or other parties. While we have not in the past suffered material harm or other adverse effects from such disruptions or failures, we may not successfully prevent, respond to or recover from such disruptions or failures in the future, and any such disruption or failure could adversely impact our ability to conduct our businesses, damage our reputation and cause losses, potentially materially.\nThe third parties with which we do business, which facilitate our business activities, to whom we outsource operations or other activities, from whom we receive products or services or with whom we otherwise engage or interact, including financial intermediaries and technology infrastructure and service providers, are also susceptible to the foregoing risks (including the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely), and our or their business operations and activities have been and may in the future be adversely affected, perhaps materially, by failures, terminations, errors or malfeasance by, or attacks or constraints on, one or more financial, technology, infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business.\nState Street Corporation | 48\nIn particular, we, like other financial services firms, will continue to face increasing cyber-threats, including computer viruses, malicious code, distributed denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, ransomware, hacker attacks, limited availability of services, unauthorized access, information security breaches or employee or contractor error or malfeasance that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our, our clients' or other parties' confidential, personal, proprietary or other information or otherwise disrupt, compromise or damage our or our clients' or other parties' business assets, operations and activities. These and similar types of threats are occurring globally with greater frequency and intensity, and we may not anticipate or implement effective preventative measures against, or identify and detect one or more, such threats, particularly because the techniques used change frequently or may not be recognized until after they are launched. Our status as a global SIFI likely increases the risk that we are targeted by such cyber-security threats. In addition, some of our service offerings, such as data warehousing, may also increase the risk we are, and the consequences of being, so targeted. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify, investigate or remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from cyber-security threats. We therefore could experience significant related costs and legal and financial exposures, including lost or constrained ability to provide our services or maintain systems availability to clients, regulatory inquiries, enforcements, actions and fines, litigation, damage to our reputation or property and enhanced competition.\nDue to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations, we are attempting to improve and update our information technology infrastructure, among other things: (1) as some of our systems are approaching the end of their useful life, are redundant or do not share data without reconciliation; (2) to be more efficient, meet increasing client and regulatory security, resiliency and other expectations and support opportunities of growth; and (3) to enhance resiliency and maintain business continuity. Updating these systems involves material costs and often involves implementation, integration and security risks, including risks that we may not adequately anticipate the market or technological trends, regulatory expectations or client needs or experience unexpected challenges that could cause financial, reputational and operational harm. Failing to properly respond to and invest in changes and advancements in technology can limit our ability to attract and retain clients, prevent us from offering similar products and services as those offered by our competitors, impair our ability to maintain continuous operations, inhibit our ability to\nmeet regulatory requirements and subject us to regulatory inquires.\nLong-term contracts expose us to pricing and performance risk.\nWe frequently enter into long-term client servicing contracts in our Investment Servicing business.  These include outsourcing and other core services contracts and can involve information technology development. These arrangements generally set forth our fee schedule for the term of the contract and, absent a change in service requirements, do not permit us to re-price the contract for changes in our costs or for market pricing. The long-term contracts for these relationships require, in some cases, considerable up-front investment by us, including technology and conversion costs, and carry the risk that pricing for the products and services we provide might not prove adequate to generate expected operating margins over the term of the contracts.\nThe profitability of these contracts is largely a function of our ability to accurately calculate pricing for our services, efficiently assume our contractual responsibilities in a timely manner, control our costs and maintain the relationship with the client for an adequate period of time to recover our up-front investment. Our estimate of the profitability of these arrangements can be adversely affected by declines in or inaccurate projections of the assets under the clients' management, whether due to general declines in the securities markets or client-specific issues. In addition, the profitability of these arrangements may be based on our ability to cross-sell additional services to these clients, and we may be unable to do so. In addition, such contracts may permit early termination or reduction in services in the event that certain service levels are not met, which termination or service reduction may result in loss of upfront investment in onboarding the client.\nPerformance risk exists in each contract, given our dependence on successful conversion and implementation onto our own operating platforms of the service activities provided. Our failure to meet specified service levels or implementation timelines may also adversely affect our revenue from such arrangements, or permit early termination of the contracts by the client. If the demand for these types of services were to decline, we could see our revenue decline.\nOur businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other reputational harm.\nOur relationship with many of our clients is predicated on our reputation as a fiduciary and a service provider that adheres to the highest standards of ethics, service quality and regulatory compliance, as well as a leading provider of the products and services we offer. Adverse publicity, regulatory actions\nState Street Corporation | 49\nor fines, litigation, operational failures, loss of client opportunities or market share or the failure to meet client expectations or fiduciary or other obligations could materially and adversely affect our reputation, our ability to attract and retain clients or key employees or our sources of funding for the same or other businesses. For example, over the past decade we have experienced adverse publicity with respect to our indirect foreign exchange trading, and this adverse publicity has contributed to a shift of client volume to other foreign exchange execution methods. Similarly, governmental actions and reputational issues in our transition management business in the U.K. have adversely affected our transition management revenue and, with criminal convictions or guilty pleas of three of our former employees in 2018 and the deferred prosecution agreement we entered into with the DOJ in early 2017 and the related SEC settlement, these effects have the potential to continue. The client invoicing matter we announced in late 2015 has had similar effects. For additional information about these matters, see the risk factor \"\nOur businesses may be adversely affected by government enforcement and litigation.\n\"\nPreserving and enhancing our reputation also depends on maintaining systems, procedures and controls that address known risks and regulatory requirements, as well as our ability to timely identify, understand and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in our businesses and the marketplaces in which we operate, the regulatory environment and client expectations.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property, and we are subject to claims of third-party intellectual property rights.\nOur potential inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology effectively may allow competitors to duplicate our technology and products and may adversely affect our ability to compete with them. To the extent that we do not protect our intellectual property effectively through patents, maintaining trade secrets or other means in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate or market our products and services, other parties, including former employees, with knowledge of our intellectual property may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own or others' advantage. In addition, we may infringe on claims of third-party patents, and we may face intellectual property challenges from other parties, including  clients or service providers with whom we may engage in the development or implementation of other products, services or solutions or to whose information we may have access for limited permitted purposes but with whom we also compete. The risk of such infringement is enhanced in the current competitive “Fintech” environment, particularly with respect to our development of new products and services containing\nsignificant technology elements and dependencies, any of which could become the subject of an infringement claim. We may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes. Third-party intellectual rights, valid or not, may also impede our deployment of the full scope of our products and service capabilities in all jurisdictions in which we operate or market our products and services.\nThe quantitative models we use to manage our business may contain errors that result in inadequate risk assessments, inaccurate valuations or poor business decisions, and lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could occur, any of which could result in material harm.\nWe use quantitative models to help manage many different aspects of our businesses. As an input to our overall assessment of capital adequacy, we use models to measure the amount of credit risk, market risk, operational risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk we face. During the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we sometimes use models to measure the value of asset and liability positions for which reliable market prices are not available. We also use models to support many different types of business decisions including trading activities, hedging, asset-and-liability management and whether to change business strategy. Weaknesses in the underlying model, inadequate model assumptions, normal model limitations, inappropriate model use, weaknesses in model implementation or poor data quality, could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences, including material loss and material non-compliance with regulatory requirements or expectations. Because of our widespread usage of models, potential weaknesses in our MRM practices pose an ongoing risk to us.\nWe also may fail to accurately quantify the magnitude of the risks we face. Our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations. These assumptions may be incorrect, and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant. Consequently, the measurements that we make for regulatory purposes may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses. Moreover, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution. While our risk measures may indicate sufficient capitalization, they may underestimate the level of capital necessary to conduct our businesses.\nAdditionally, our disclosure controls and procedures may not be effective in every circumstance, and, similarly, it is possible we may\nState Street Corporation | 50\nidentify a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting. Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose us to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments or harm our reputation.\nOur reputation and business prospects may be damaged if our clients incur substantial losses in investment pools that we sponsor or manage or are restricted in redeeming their interests in these investment pools.\nWe manage assets on behalf of clients in several forms, including in collective investment pools, money market funds, securities finance collateral pools, cash collateral and other cash products and short-term investment funds. Our management of collective investment pools on behalf of clients exposes us to reputational risk and operational losses. If our clients incur substantial investment losses in these pools, receive redemptions as in-kind distributions rather than in cash, or experience significant under-performance relative to the market or our competitors' products, our reputation could be significantly harmed, which harm could significantly and adversely affect the prospects of our associated business units. Because we often implement investment and operational decisions and actions over multiple investment pools to achieve scale, we face the risk that losses, even small losses, may have a significant effect in the aggregate.\nWithin our Investment Management business, we manage investment pools, such as mutual funds and collective investment funds that generally offer our clients the ability to withdraw their investments on short notice, generally daily or monthly. This feature requires that we manage those pools in a manner that takes into account both maximizing the long-term return on the investment pool and retaining sufficient liquidity to meet reasonably anticipated liquidity requirements of our clients. The importance of maintaining liquidity varies by product type, but it is a particularly important feature in money market funds and other products designed to maintain a constant net asset value of $1.00. In the past, we have imposed restrictions on cash redemptions from the agency lending collateral pools, as the per-unit market value of those funds' assets had declined below the constant $1.00 the funds employ to effect purchase and redemption transactions. Both the decline of the funds' net asset value below $1.00 and the imposition of restrictions on redemptions had a significant client, reputational and regulatory impact on us, and the recurrence of such or similar\ncircumstances in the future could adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. We have also in the past continued to process purchase and redemption of units of investment products designed to maintain a constant net asset value at $1.00 although the fair market value of the fund’s assets were less than $1.00. If in the future we were to continue to process purchases and redemptions from such products at $1.00 when the fair market value of our collateral pools' assets is less than $1.00, we could be exposed to significant liability.\nIf higher than normal demands for liquidity from our clients were to occur, managing the liquidity requirements of our collective investment pools could become more difficult. If such liquidity problems were to recur, our relationships with our clients may be adversely affected, and, we could, in certain circumstances, be required to consolidate the investment pools into our consolidated statement of condition; levels of redemption activity could increase; and our consolidated results of operations and business prospects could be adversely affected. In addition, if a money market fund that we manage were to have unexpected liquidity demands from investors in the fund that exceeded available liquidity, the fund could be required to sell assets to meet those redemption requirements, and selling the assets held by the fund at a reasonable price, if at all, may then be difficult.\nBecause of the size of the investment pools that we manage, we may not have the financial ability or regulatory authority to support the liquidity or other demands of our clients. Any decision by us to provide financial support to an investment pool to support our reputation in circumstances where we are not statutorily or contractually obligated to do so could result in the recognition of significant losses, could adversely affect the regulatory view of our capital levels or plans and could, in some cases, require us to consolidate the investment pools into our consolidated statement of condition. Any failure of the pools to meet redemption requests, or under- performance of our pools relative to similar products offered by our competitors, could harm our business and our reputation.\nWe may incur losses arising from our investments in sponsored investment funds, which could be material to our consolidated results of operations in the periods incurred.\nIn the normal course of business, we manage various types of sponsored investment funds through State Street Global Advisors. The services we provide to these sponsored investment funds generate management fee revenue, as well as servicing fees from our other businesses. From time to time, we may invest in the funds, which we refer to as seed\nState Street Corporation | 51\ncapital, in order for the funds to establish a performance history for newly launched strategies. These funds may meet the definition of variable interest entities, as defined by U.S. GAAP, and if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of these funds, we may be required to consolidate these funds in our consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP. The funds follow specialized investment company accounting rules which prescribe fair value for the underlying investment securities held by the funds.\nIn the aggregate, we expect any financial losses that we realize over time from these seed investments to be limited to the actual amount invested in the consolidated fund. However, in the event of a fund wind-down, gross gains and losses of the fund may be recognized for financial accounting purposes in different periods during the time the fund is consolidated but not wholly owned. Although we expect the actual economic loss to be limited to the amount invested, our losses in any period for financial accounting purposes could exceed the value of our economic interests in the fund and could exceed the value of our initial seed capital investment.\nIn instances where we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the sponsored investment fund, we do not include the funds in our consolidated financial statements. Our risk of loss associated with investment in these unconsolidated funds primarily represents our seed capital investment, which could become realized as a result of poor investment performance. However, the amount of loss we may recognize during any period would be limited to the carrying amount of our investment.\nClimate change may increase the frequency and severity of major weather events and could adversely affect our business operations.\nOur businesses and the activities of our clients, business partners and the financial infrastructure on which we and they rely could be adversely affected by major weather events or other disruptions caused by climate change affecting the regions, countries and locations in which we or they have operations or other interests. Potential events or disruptions of this nature include significant rainfall, flooding, increased frequency or intensity of wildfires, prolonged drought, rising sea levels and rising heat index. These events or disruptions, alone or in combination, also have the potential to strain or deplete infrastructure and response capabilities with respect to other weather events, such as hurricanes and other storms. The occurrence of any one or more of these events may negatively affect our or our clients’, business partners’ or financial infrastructure providers’ facilities, operations or personnel or may otherwise disrupt our or their business activities, including our or their provision of products and services or the value of our or their portfolio investments, perhaps materially.  These consequences, including a material reduction\nin asset values affecting the levels of our AUC/A or AUM, could materially adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, climate change-related legislative and regulatory initiatives may result in operational changes and expenditures that could adversely affect us. Our reputation may also be damaged if we do not, or are perceived not to, effectively prepare for the potential business and operational risks associated with climate change.\nWe may incur losses as a result of unforeseen events including terrorist attacks, natural disasters, the emergence of a new pandemic or acts of embezzlement.\nActs of terrorism, natural disasters or the emergence of a new pandemic could significantly affect our business. We have instituted disaster recovery and continuity plans to address risks from terrorism, natural disasters and pandemic; however, anticipating or addressing all potential contingencies is not possible for events of this nature. Acts of terrorism, either targeted or broad in scope, or natural disasters could damage our physical facilities, harm our employees and disrupt our operations. A pandemic, or concern about a possible pandemic, could lead to operational difficulties and impair our ability to manage our business. Acts of terrorism, natural disasters and pandemics could also negatively affect our clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as result in disruptions in general economic activity and the financial markets.\nState Street Corporation | 52"

    "text": "MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY\nOur common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol STT. There were 2,295 shareholders of record as of January 31, 2021.\nIn June 2019, our Board approved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 (the 2019 Program). On March 16, 2020, we, along with the other U.S. G-SIBs, suspended common share repurchases and maintained this suspension through the fourth quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This suspension was consistent with limitations imposed by the Federal Reserve beginning in the second quarter of 2020. As a result, we had no repurchases of our common stock in the second, third or fourth quarters of 2020. In December 2020,  the Federal Reserve issued results of the 2020 resubmission stress tests and authorized us to continue to pay common stock dividends at current levels and to resume repurchasing common shares in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain limitations (together with common stock dividends) based primarily on average 2020 quarterly net income. In January 2021, our Board authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $475 million of our common stock through March 31, 2021. Stock purchases may be made using various types of mechanisms, including open market purchases or transactions off market, and may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs. The timing of stock purchases, types of transactions and number of shares purchased will depend on several factors, including market conditions, our capital position, our financial performance and investment\nState Street Corporation | 55\nopportunities. Our common stock purchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time. We may employ third-party broker/dealers to acquire shares on the open market in connection with our common stock purchase programs. The common stock purchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.\nAdditional information about our common stock, including Board authorization with respect to purchases by us of our common stock, is provided under \"Capital\" in “Financial Condition” in our Management's Discussion and Analysis and in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K, and is incorporated herein by reference.\nRELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\nAs a bank holding company, our Parent Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its principal banking subsidiary, State Street Bank, and its non-banking subsidiaries. The right of the Parent Company to participate as a shareholder in any distribution of assets of State Street Bank upon its liquidation, reorganization or otherwise is subject to the prior claims by creditors of State Street Bank, including obligations for federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements and deposit liabilities.\nPayment of dividends by State Street Bank is subject to the provisions of the Massachusetts banking law, which provide that State Street Bank's Board of Directors may declare, from State Street Bank's \"net profits,\" as defined below, cash dividends annually, semi-annually or quarterly (but not more frequently) and can declare non-cash dividends at any time. Under Massachusetts banking law, for purposes of determining the amount of cash dividends that are payable by State Street Bank, “net profits” is defined as an amount equal to the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets, after deducting from the total thereof all current operating expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all federal and state taxes.\nNo dividends may be declared, credited or paid so long as there is any impairment of State Street Bank's capital stock. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required if the total of all dividends declared by State Street Bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfer to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock.\nUnder Federal Reserve regulations, the approval of the Federal Reserve would be required for the payment of dividends by State Street Bank if\nthe total amount of all dividends declared by State Street Bank in any calendar year, including any proposed dividend, would exceed the total of its net income for such calendar year as reported in State Street Bank's\nConsolidated Reports of Condition and Income for a Bank with Domestic and Foreign Offices Only - FFIEC 031\n, commonly referred to as the “Call Report,” as submitted through the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council and provided to the Federal Reserve, plus its “retained net income” for the preceding two calendar years. For these purposes, “retained net income,” as of any date of determination, is defined as an amount equal to State Street Bank's net income (as reported in its Call Reports for the calendar year in which retained net income is being determined) less any dividends declared during such year. In determining the amount of dividends that are payable, the total of State Street Bank's net income for the current year and its retained net income for the preceding two calendar years is reduced by any net losses incurred in the current or preceding two-year period and by any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of preferred stock.\nPrior Federal Reserve approval also must be obtained if a proposed dividend would exceed State Street Bank's “undivided profits” (retained earnings) as reported in its Call Reports. State Street Bank may include in its undivided profits amounts contained in its surplus account, if the amounts reflect transfers of undivided profits made in prior periods and if the Federal Reserve's approval for the transfer back to undivided profits has been obtained.\nUnder the PCA provisions adopted pursuant to the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, State Street Bank may not pay a dividend when it is deemed, under the PCA framework, to be under-capitalized, or when the payment of the dividend would cause State Street Bank to be under-capitalized. If State Street Bank is under-capitalized for purposes of the PCA framework, it must cease paying dividends for so long as it is deemed to be under-capitalized. Once earnings have begun to improve and an adequate capital position has been restored, dividend payments may resume in accordance with federal and state statutory limitations and guidelines.\nState Street Corporation | 56\nCurrently, any payment of future common stock dividends by our Parent Company to its shareholders is subject to the review of our capital plan by the Federal Reserve in connection with its CCAR process. Information about dividends declared by our Parent Company and dividends from our subsidiary banks is provided under \"Capital\" in “Financial Condition” in our Management's Discussion and Analysis, and in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K, and is incorporated herein by reference. Future dividend payments of State Street Bank and our non-banking subsidiaries cannot be determined at this time. In addition, refer to “Capital Planning, Stress Tests and Dividends” in \"Supervision and Regulation\" in Business in this Form 10-K and the risk factor “\nOur business and capital-related activities, including our ability to return capital to shareholders and repurchase our capital stock, may be adversely affected by our implementation of regulatory capital and liquidity standards that we must meet or in the event our capital plan or post-stress capital ratios are determined to be insufficient as a result of regulatory capital stress testing\n” in Risk Factors in this Form 10-K.\nInformation about our equity compensation plans is in Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters, and in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K, and is incorporated herein by reference.\nSHAREHOLDER RETURN PERFORMANCE PRESENTATION\nThe graph presented below compares the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock to the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index, the S&P Financial Index and the KBW Bank Index over a five-year period. The cumulative total shareholder return assumes the investment of $100 in our common stock and in each index on December 31, 2015. It also assumes reinvestment of common stock dividends.\nThe S&P Financial Index is a publicly available, capitalization-weighted index, comprised of 65 of the Standard & Poor’s 500 companies, representing 25 diversified financial services companies, 22 insurance companies and 18 banking companies. The KBW Bank Index is a modified cap-weighted index consisting of 24 exchange-listed stocks, representing national money center banks and leading regional institutions.\nState Street Corporation | 57\nITEM 6.\nSELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\n(1)\nCRD was acquired on October 1, 2018. 2018 includes results of CRD for one quarter. 2019 and 2020 include results of CRD for a full year.

We operate in more than 100 geographic markets worldwide, including the U.S., Canada, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.\nOur operations are organized into two lines of business, Investment Servicing and Investment Management, which are defined based on products and services provided.\nInvestment Servicing\nprovides services for institutional clients, including mutual funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, investment managers, foundations and endowments worldwide. Products include: custody; product accounting; daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; depotbank services (a fund oversight role created by non-U.S. regulation); record-keeping; cash management; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance and enhanced custody products; deposit and short-term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance analytics; and financial data management to support institutional investors.\nIncluded within our Investment Servicing line of business is CRD, which we acquired in October 2018. The Charles River Investment Management solution is a technology offering which is designed to automate and simplify the institutional investment process across asset classes, from portfolio management and risk analytics through trading and post-trade settlement, with integrated compliance and managed data throughout. With the acquisition of CRD, we took the first step in building our front-to-back platform, State Street Alpha. Today our State Street Alpha platform combines portfolio management, trading and execution, advanced data aggregation, analytics and compliance tools, and integration with other industry platforms and providers.\nInvestment Management\n, through State Street Global Advisors, provides a broad range of investment management strategies and products for our clients. Our investment management strategies and products span the risk/reward spectrum for equity, fixed income and cash assets, including core and enhanced indexing, multi-asset strategies, active quantitative and fundamental active capabilities and\nalternative investment strategies. Our AUM is currently primarily weighted to indexed strategies. In addition, we provide a breadth of services and solutions, including environmental, social and governance investing, defined benefit and defined contribution and Global Fiduciary Solutions (formerly Outsourced Chief Investment Officer). State Street Global Advisors is also a provider of ETFs, including the SPDR\n®\nETF brand. While management fees are primarily determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees.\nFor financial and other information about our lines of business, refer to “Line of Business Information” in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Certain previously reported amounts presented in this Form 10-K have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in its application of certain accounting policies that materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses.\nThe significant accounting policies that require us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that are difficult, subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods include:\n•\naccounting for fair value measurements;\n•\nallowance for credit losses;\n•\nimpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; and\n•\ncontingencies.\nThese significant accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be subject to revision as new information becomes available. Additional information about these significant accounting policies is included under\nState Street Corporation | 59\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n“Significant Accounting Estimates” in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nCertain financial information provided in this Form 10-K, including this Management's Discussion and Analysis, is prepared on both a U.S. GAAP, or reported basis, and a non-GAAP basis, including certain non-GAAP measures used in the calculation of identified regulatory ratios. We measure and compare certain financial information on a non-GAAP basis, including information that management uses in evaluating our business and activities. Non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, financial information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Any non-GAAP financial information presented in this Form 10-K, including this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, is reconciled to its most directly comparable currently applicable regulatory ratio or U.S. GAAP-basis measure. We further believe that our presentation of fully taxable-equivalent NII, a non-GAAP measure, which reports non-taxable revenue, such as interest income associated with tax-exempt investment securities, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, facilitates an investor's understanding and analysis of our underlying financial performance and trends.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis contains statements that are considered \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of U.S. securities laws. Forward-looking statements include statements about our goals and expectations regarding our business, financial and capital condition, results of operations, strategies, cost savings and transformation initiatives, investment portfolio performance, dividend and stock purchase programs, outcomes of legal proceedings, market growth, acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures, client growth and new technologies, services and opportunities, as well as industry, governmental, regulatory, economic and market trends, initiatives and developments, the business environment and other matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts.

Please refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for additional information.\n(3)\nAdditional information about our preferred stock dividends is provided in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\n(4)\nRepresents the portion of net income available to common equity allocated to participating securities, composed of unvested and fully vested SERP (Supplemental executive retirement plans) shares and fully vested deferred director stock awards, which are equity-based awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, and are considered to participate with the common stock in undistributed earnings.\nState Street Corporation | 61\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following “Financial Results and Highlights” section provides information related to significant events, as well as highlights of our consolidated financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 presented in Table 1: Overview of Financial Results. More detailed information about our consolidated financial results, including the comparison of our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 to those for the year ended December 31, 2019, is provided under “Consolidated Results of Operations”, \"Line of Business Information\" and \"Capital\" which follows these sections, as well as in our consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nThe comparison of our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2019 to those for the year ended December 31, 2018 is included in our Management's Discussion and Analysis in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the SEC on February 20, 2020.\nIn this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, where we describe the effects of changes in FX rates, those effects are determined by applying applicable weighted average FX rates from the relevant 2019 period to the relevant 2020 period results.\nFinancial Results and Highlights\n•\n2020 financial performance:\n◦\nEPS of $6.32 in 2020 increased 17% compared to $5.38 in 2019.\n◦\nIn 2020, return on equity of 10.0% increased from 9.4% in 2019, primarily due to an increase in net income available to common shareholders. Pre-tax margin of  24.8% in 2020 increased from 23.1% in 2019, primarily due to a decrease in total expenses.\n◦\nOperating leverage was 3.0% points in 2020. Operating leverage represents the difference between the percentage change in total revenue and the percentage change in total expenses, in each case relative to the prior year period.\n•\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the actions we took to support our clients, the financial markets and the broader economy, is reflected in our 2020 results:\n◦\nWe experienced higher levels of client deposits and record client FX trading volume.\n◦\nWe continued to onboard new clients and managed elevated transaction volumes in the first half of the year.\n◦\nWe supported our clients' liquidity needs through our participation in the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF) and are custodian and administrator for four Federal Reserve Programs: Commercial Paper Funding Facility, Main Street Lending Program, and Primary and Secondary Markets Corporate Credit Facilities.\n◦\nHaving moved up to approximately 90% of our workforce to a remote working environment in the first half of 2020, we developed a safe and measured framework to reopen offices and are establishing a \"Workplace of the Future\" plan, leveraging technology and a hybrid work from home model, with approximately 80% of our employees continuing to work remotely as of December 31, 2020.\nRevenue\n•\nTotal revenue was flat in 2020 compared to 2019, as the increase in total fee revenue was offset by a decline in NII. Total fee revenue increased 4% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by increases in servicing fees, management fees, foreign exchange trading services and software and processing fees, partially offset by lower securities finance revenue.\n•\nServicing fee revenue increased 2% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher average market levels and client activity, primarily in the first half of 2020, partially offset by normal pricing headwinds. FX rates impacted servicing fees positively by 1% in 2020, relative to 2019.\n•\nManagement fee revenue increased 3% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher average market levels and ETF and cash net inflows, partially offset by net institutional outflows.\n•\nForeign exchange trading services increased 29% in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to elevated market volatility and record client FX volumes.\n•\nSecurities finance revenue decreased 24% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting decreases in enhanced custody balances due to client deleveraging and lower agency lending revenues due to lower spreads.\n•\nSoftware and processing fees revenue increased 2% in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by higher CRD revenues.\nState Street Corporation | 62\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n◦\nTotal revenues contributed by CRD in 2020 were approximately $420 million, including $406 million in software and processing fees and $14 million in brokerage and other trading services, within foreign exchange trading services. CRD revenue with affiliated entities, which is eliminated in our consolidated financial statements, was $39 million and $18 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n•\nNII decreased 14% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower  market rates, partially offset by higher client deposits balances, higher loans and  investment portfolio growth.\nProvision for Credit Losses\n•\nWe adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, on January 1, 2020, which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected credit loss methodology that is referred to as the CECL methodology. The impact of transitioning to ASC 326 on the consolidated financial statements was an increase in the allowance for credit losses and a decrease in retained earnings of $3 million. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $88 million in 2020, which reflects the impact of credit migration within our loan portfolio, as well as a downward revision in management’s economic outlook reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n•\nIn 2019, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $10 million under the incurred loss methodology.\nExpenses\n•\nTotal expenses decreased 4% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily reflecting on-going expense management initiatives and lower notable items.\n•\n2020 notable items included:\n◦\nrepositioning charges of approximately $133 million, consisting of $82 million of compensation and employee benefits expenses and $51 million of occupancy costs, in order to further drive automation of processes and organizational simplification, enablement of workforce rationalization and reduction of our real estate footprint by approximately 13% of our total square footage;\n◦\nacquisition and restructuring costs of approximately $50 million, primarily related to CRD;\n◦\naccrual release of approximately $9 million; and\n◦\ncosts of $9 million due to the redemption of all outstanding Series C non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock representing the difference between the redemption value and the net carrying value of the preferred stock.\n•\n2019 notable items included:\n◦\nrepositioning charges of approximately $110 million;\n◦\nlegal and related expenses of approximately $172 million;\n◦\nacquisition and restructuring costs  of approximately $77 million, primarily related to CRD;\n◦\ngain of approximately $44 million on the extinguishment of approximately $297 million of our outstanding floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2047 following a cash tender offer; and\n◦\ncosts of $22 million due to the redemption of all outstanding Series E non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock representing the difference between the redemption value and the net carrying value of the preferred stock.\n•\nTotal expenses contributed by CRD in 2020 and 2019 were approximately $248 million and $201 million, respectively, including $183 million and  $148 million in compensation and employee benefits and $65 million and  $53 million  in other expense lines, respectively. In addition, CRD-related expenses in 2020 and 2019 included $66 million and $65 million, respectively, in amortization of other intangible assets.\nAUC/A and AUM\n•\nAUC/A increased 13% as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher period-end market levels, net new business installations and client flows. In 2020, newly announced asset servicing mandates totaled approximately $787 billion, with an increasing proportion incorporating State Street Alpha. Servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately $436 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nState Street Corporation | 63\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n•\nAUM increased 11% as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher period-end market levels and net inflows from ETFs and cash, partially offset by institutional net outflows.\nCapital\n•\nIn 2020, we returned a total of approximately $1.23 billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock dividends and share purchases. On March 16, 2020, we, along with the other U.S. G-SIBs, suspended common share repurchases through the fourth quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This suspension was consistent with limitations imposed by the Federal Reserve beginning in the second quarter of 2020.\n▪\nWe declared aggregate common stock dividends of $2.08 per share, totaling $734 million in 2020, compared to $1.98 per share, totaling $728 million in 2019.\n•\nIn 2020, we acquired 6.5 million shares of common stock at an average per share cost of $77.35 and an aggregate cost of approximately $500 million. In 2019, we acquired 24.9 million shares of common stock at an average per share cost of $64.30 and an aggregate cost of approximately $1.6 billion. These purchases were all conducted under share purchase programs approved by our Board of Directors.\n•\nAs required by the Federal Reserve, we and other participating CCAR banks resubmitted our capital plans by November 2, 2020 under updated scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Effective December 2020, the Federal Reserve has authorized us to continue to pay common stock dividends at current levels and to resume repurchasing common shares in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain limitations (together with common stock dividends) based primarily on average 2020 quarterly net income. In January 2021, our Board authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $475 million of our common stock through March 31, 2021.\n•\nOur CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.3% as of December 31, 2020 compared to 11.7% as of December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher retained earnings, partially offset by an increase in risk weighted assets primarily due to higher client lending activity. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased to 6.4% as of December 31, 2020 compared to 6.9% as of\nDecember 31, 2019 due to an increase in adjusted average assets driven by higher deposits, partially offset by higher retained earnings. As of December 31, 2020, standardized capital ratios were binding. As of December 31, 2019, advanced approaches capital ratios were binding.\nCapital Redemptions\n•\nWe redeemed all outstanding Series C non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock on March 15, 2020 at an aggregate redemption price of $500 million ($100,000 per share equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share) plus accrued and unpaid dividends.\n•\nOn January 14, 2021, we announced that we will redeem on March 15, 2021 an aggregate of $500 million, or 5,000 of the 7,500 outstanding shares of our non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series F, for cash at a redemption price of $100,000 per share (equivalent to $1,000 per depositary share) plus all declared and unpaid dividends. A cash dividend of $953.38 per share of Series F Preferred Stock (or approximately $9.5338 per depositary share) has been declared for the period from December 15, 2020 up to but not including March 15, 2021 (the “March Dividend”). The March Dividend will be paid separately to the holders of record of the Series F Preferred Stock as of March 1, 2021 in the customary manner. Accordingly, there will not be any declared and unpaid dividends included in the redemption price.\nDebt Issuances\n•\nOn January 24, 2020, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.400% Senior Notes due 2030.\n•\nOn March 26, 2020, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.825% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2023, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.901% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2026 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.152% of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2031.\nState Street Corporation | 64\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section discusses our consolidated results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019 and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nTotal Revenue\n(1)\nCertain fees associated with our GLD ETFs have been reclassified from foreign exchange trading services to management fees to better reflect the nature of those fees. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation. These fees were approximately $81 million, $53 million and $48 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(2)\nCRD contributed approximately $420 million in total revenue in 2020, approximately $385 million in total revenue in 2019 and approximately $119 million in total revenue in 2018, which reflects their results from October 1, 2018, the date of acquisition, through December 31, 2018.\n(3)\nThe impact of State Street Global Advisors Money Market Fund fee waivers on total fee revenue was less than $10 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nnm\nNot meaningful\nFee Revenue\nTable 2: Total Revenue, provides the breakout of fee revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Servicing and management fees collectively made up approximately 74%, 75% and 77% of the total fee revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nServicing Fee Revenue\nGenerally, our servicing fee revenues are affected by several factors including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, net new business and the manner in which we price our services. We provide a range of services to our clients, including core custody services, accounting, reporting and administration and middle office services, and the nature and mix of services provided affects our servicing fees. The basis for fees will differ across regions and clients.\nChanges in Market Valuations\nOur servicing fee revenue is impacted by both our levels and the geographic and product mix of our AUC/A. Increases or decreases in market valuations have a corresponding impact on the level of our AUC/A and servicing fee revenues, though the degree of impact will vary depending on asset types and classes and geography of assets held within our clients’ portfolios.\nOver the five years ended December 31, 2020, we estimate that worldwide market valuations impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately (1)% to 5% annually and approximately 2% and 0% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Year-End Equity Indices for selected indices. While the specific indices presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and the performance of associated relevant indices and of client portfolios can therefore differ from the performance of the indices presented. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.\nAssuming that all other factors remain constant, including client activity and asset flows and pricing, we estimate, using relevant information as of December 31, 2020 that a 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity\nState Street Corporation | 65\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nvaluations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our servicing fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total servicing fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 3%. We estimate, similarly assuming all other factors constant and using relevant information as of December 31, 2020, that changes in worldwide fixed income markets, which on a weighted average basis and over time are typically less volatile than worldwide equity markets, have a smaller impact on our servicing fee revenues on average and over time.\n(1)\nThe index names listed in the table are service marks of their respective owners.\n(1)\nThe index names listed in the table are service marks of their respective owners.\nClient Activity and Asset Flows\nClient activity and asset flows are impacted by the number of transactions we execute on behalf of our clients, including FX settlements, equity and derivative trades, and wire transfer activity, as well as actions by our clients to change the asset class in which their assets are invested. Our servicing fee revenues are impacted by a number of factors, including transaction volumes, asset levels and asset classes in which funds are invested, as well as industry trends associated with these client-related activities.\nOur clients may change the asset classes in which their assets are invested, based on their market outlook, risk acceptance tolerance or other considerations. Over the five years ended December 31, 2020, we estimate that client activity and asset flows, together, impacted our servicing fee revenues by approximately (1)% to 2% annually and approximately 2% and (1)% in 2020 and 2019, respectively, with the impact for 2020 largely in the first half of the year. See Table 5: Industry Asset Flows for selected asset flow information. While the asset flows presented are indicative of general market trends, the asset types and classes relevant to individual client portfolios can and do differ, and our flows may differ from those market trends. In addition, our asset classifications may differ from those industry classifications presented.\n(1)\nIndustry data is provided for illustrative purposes only. It is not intended to reflect our activity or our clients' activity and is indicative of only segments of the entire industry.\n(2)\nSource: Morningstar. The data includes long-term mutual funds, ETFs and money market funds. Mutual fund data represents estimates of net new cash flow, which is new sales minus redemptions combined with net exchanges, while ETF data represents net issuance, which is gross issuance less gross redemptions. Data for Fund of Funds, Feeder funds and Obsolete funds were excluded from the series to prevent double counting. Data is from the Morningstar Direct Asset Flows database.\n(3)\nThe year ended December 31, 2020 data for North America (US domiciled) includes Morningstar direct actuals for January 2020 through November 2020 and Morningstar direct estimates for December 2020.\n(4)\nThe long-term fund flows reported by Morningstar direct in North America are composed of US domiciled market flows mainly in Equities, Allocation and Fixed-Income asset classes. The long-term fund flows reported by Morningstar direct in EMEA are composed of the European market flows mainly in Equities, Allocation and Fixed-Income asset classes.\n(5)\nThe year ended December 31, 2020 data for Europe is on a rolling twelve month basis for December 2019 through November 2020, sourced by  Morningstar.\nState Street Corporation | 66\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet New Business\nOver the five years ended December 31, 2020, net new business, which includes business both won and lost, has affected our servicing fee revenues by approximately 2% on average with a range of 0% to 3% annually and approximately 0% and 0% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Gross investment servicing mandates were $787 billion in 2020 and $1.3 trillion per year on average over the past five years. Over the five years ended December 31, 2020, gross annual investment servicing mandates ranged from $750 billion to nearly $2.0 trillion.\nNew business impacting servicing fees can include: custody; product accounting; daily valuation and administration; record-keeping; cash management; and other services. Revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided, the time required to install the assets, and the types of assets installed.\nRevenues associated with new mandates are not reflected in our servicing fee revenue until the assets have been installed. Our installation timeline, in general, can range from 6 to 36 months, with the average installation timeline being approximately 9 to 12 months over the past 2 years. Our more complex installations, including new State Street Alpha mandates, will generally be on the longer end of that range.\nPricing\nThe industry in which we operate has historically faced pricing pressure, and our servicing fee revenues are also affected by such pressures today. Consequently, no assumption should be drawn as to future revenue run rate from announced servicing wins, as the amount of revenue associated with AUC/A can vary materially. On average, over the five years ended December 31, 2020, we estimate that pricing pressure with respect to existing clients has impacted our servicing fees by approximately (2)% annually, with the impact ranging from (1)% to (4)% in any given year, and approximately (2)% in 2020 and (4)% in 2019. Pricing concessions can be a part of a contract renegotiation with a client including terms that may benefit us, such as extending the terms of our relationship with the client, expanding the scope of services that we provide or reducing our dependency on manual processes through the standardization of the services we provide. The timing of the impact of additional revenue generated by anticipated additional services, and the amount of revenue generated, may differ from the impact of pricing concessions on existing services due to the necessary time required to onboard those new services, the nature of those services and client investment practices. These same market pressures\nalso impact the fees we negotiate when we win business from new clients.\nIn order to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds, we estimate that we need  at least $1.5 trillion of new AUC/A per year; although, notwithstanding increases in AUC/A, servicing fees remain subject to several factors, including changes in market valuations, client activity and asset flows, the manner in which we price our services, the nature of the assets being serviced and the type of services and the other factors described in this Form 10-K.\nHistorically, and based on an indicative sample of revenue, we estimate that approximately 55%, on average, of our servicing fee revenues have been variable due to changes in asset valuations including changes in daily average valuations of AUC/A; another 15%, on average, of our servicing fees are impacted by the volume of activity in the funds we serve; and the remaining approximately 30% of our servicing fees tend not to be variable in nature nor impacted by market fluctuations or values.\nThe impact of the above, client activity and asset flows, net new business and pricing, noted drivers of our servicing fee revenue will vary depending on the mix of products and services we provide to our clients. The full impact of changes in market valuations and the volume of activity in the funds may not be fully reflected in our servicing fee revenues in the periods in which the changes occur, particularly in periods of higher volatility.\nManagement Fee Revenue\nManagement fees generally are affected by our level of AUM, which we report based on month-end valuations. Management fees for certain components of managed assets, such as ETFs, mutual funds and UCITS, are affected by daily average valuations of AUM. Management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue, as a higher proportion of the underlying services provided, and the associated management fees earned, are dependent on equity and fixed-income security valuations. Additional factors, such as the relative mix of assets managed, may have a significant effect on our management fee revenue. While certain management fees are directly determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees may reflect other factors, including performance fee arrangements, as well as our relationship pricing for clients. In addition, in a prolonged low-interest rate environment, such as we are currently experiencing, we have waived and may in the future waive certain fees for our clients for money market products.\nAsset-based management fees for passively managed products, to which our AUM is currently primarily weighted, are generally charged at a lower fee on AUM than for actively managed products.\nState Street Corporation | 67\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nActively managed products may also include performance fee arrangements which are recorded when the fee is earned, based on predetermined benchmarks associated with the applicable account's performance.\nIn light of the above, we estimate, using relevant information as of December 31, 2020 and assuming that all other factors remain constant, including the impact of business won and lost and client flows, that:\n•\nA 10% increase or decrease in worldwide equity valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues, on average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 5%; and\n•\nA 10% increase or decrease in worldwide fixed-income valuations, on a weighted average basis, over the relevant periods for which our management fees are calculated, would result in a corresponding change in our total management fee revenues\n,\non average and over multiple quarters, of approximately 4%.\nDaily averages, month-end averages and year-end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity and debt markets that affect our management fee revenue. Year-end indices affect the values of AUM as of those dates. See Table 3: Daily Averages, Month-End Averages and Year-End Equity Indices for selected indices.\nAdditional information about fee revenue is provided under \"Line of Business Information\" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nNet Interest Income\nSee Table 2: Total Revenue, for the breakout of interest income and interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nNII is defined as interest income earned on interest-earning assets less interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets, which principally consist of investment securities, interest-bearing deposits with banks, loans, resale agreements and other liquid assets, are financed primarily by client deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt.\nNIM represents the relationship between annualized FTE NII and average total interest-earning assets for the period. It is calculated by dividing FTE NII by average interest-earning assets. Revenue that is exempt from income taxes, mainly earned from certain investment securities (state and political subdivisions), is adjusted to a FTE basis using the U.S. federal and state statutory income tax rates.\nNII on a FTE basis decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower market rates, partially offset by higher client deposits, core loan and investment securities balances.\nInvestment securities net premium amortization, which is included in interest income, was $575 million in 2020 compared to $434 million  in 2019 and $391 million in 2018. The increase is primarily driven by higher MBS premium amortization as a result of lower interest rates and faster prepayments. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately 61%, 60% and 52%, respectively, of unamortized premiums, net of discounts, was related to mortgage-backed securities\n.\nInterest income related to debt securities is recognized in our consolidated statement of income using the effective interest method, or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the contractual or estimated life of the security. The rate of return considers any non-refundable fees or costs, as well as purchase premiums or discounts, resulting in amortization or accretion, accordingly. The amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are adjusted for prepayments when they occur, which primarily impact mortgage-backed securities.\nThe following table presents the investment securities amortizable purchase premium net of discount accretion for the periods indicated:\n(1)\nNet of discount accretion on MMLF HTM securities.\n(2)\nExcluding investment securities purchased under the MMLF program, the investment securities portfolio duration is 3.1 years in 2020.\nState Street Corporation | 68\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nMoney Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility\nIn March 2020, in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve established the MMLF program in order to enhance the liquidity and functioning of crucial money markets. Through the establishment of the MMLF program, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston makes loans available to eligible financial institutions secured by high-quality assets purchased by the financial institution from money market mutual funds. The MMLF program was authorized through December 31, 2020. We are supporting our clients' liquidity needs through this program, following its adoption on March 18, 2020. As a result of the asset purchases (including negotiable CDs, municipals and asset-backed commercial paper), our participation in the facility was $8.2 billion on average in 2020, and earned $16 million of NII, but was dilutive to NIM in 2020. The purchases are match funded through Federal Reserve borrowings and the assets are posted as collateral. The borrowing is non-recourse, meaning that the Federal Reserve has taken on the credit risk of the assets purchased. The purchased securities are classified as held-to-maturity and have a maturity of less than 12 months. MMLF related assets do not impact our risk-based and leverage capital ratios.\nSee Table 7: Average Balances and Interest Rates - Fully Taxable-Equivalent Basis, for the breakout of NII on a FTE basis for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n(1)\nRates earned/paid on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities include the impact of hedge activities associated with our asset and liability management activities where applicable.\n(2)\nReflects the impact of balance sheet netting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $100.45 billion, $86.67 billion and $35.74 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluding the impact of netting, the average interest rates would be approximately 0.12%, 0.41% and 0.87% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(3)\nAverage rate includes the impact of FX swap costs of approximately ($63) million, $153 million and $106 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Average rates for total interest-bearing deposits excluding the impact of FX swap costs were (0.03)%, 0.40% and 0.20% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(4)\nTotal deposits averaged $193.22 billion compared to $158.26 billion and $161.41 billion for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nState Street Corporation | 69\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nChanges in the components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below. Additional information about the components of interest income and interest expense is provided in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nAverage total interest-earning assets were $228.87 billion in 2020 compared to $181.89 billion in 2019. The increase is primarily due to higher interest-bearing deposits with banks and investment securities.\nInterest-bearing deposits with banks averaged $76.59 billion in 2020 compared to $48.50 billion in 2019. These deposits primarily reflect our maintenance of cash balances at the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank (ECB) and other non-U.S. central banks. The higher levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect higher levels of client deposits.\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements averaged $3.45 billion in 2020 compared to $2.51 billion in 2019. The impact of balance sheet netting increased to $100.45 billion on average in 2020\ncompared to $86.67 billion in 2019. We maintain an agreement with Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), a clearing organization that enables us to net all securities sold under repurchase agreements against those purchased under resale agreements with counterparties that are also members of the clearing organization. The increase in average balance sheet netting in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to the expansion of our FICC program and new client activity.\nWe have been a sponsoring member within FICC since 2005. FICC expanded the service in 2017, and since then, we have increased our participation each year. We enter into repurchase and resale transactions in eligible securities with sponsored clients and with other FICC members and, pursuant to FICC Government Securities Division rules, submit, novate and net the transactions. We may sponsor clients to clear their eligible repurchase transactions with FICC, backed by our guarantee to FICC of the prompt and full payment and performance of our sponsored member clients’ respective obligations. We obtain a security interest from our sponsored clients in the high quality securities collateral that they receive, which is designed to mitigate our potential exposure to FICC.\nAverage investment securities increased to $109.18 billion in 2020 from $91.77 billion in 2019 primarily driven by the MMLF program, MBS balances and foreign government bonds. The growth reflects our deployment of higher structural deposit levels that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLoans averaged $27.53 billion in 2020 compared to $24.07 billion in 2019. Average core\nloans, which exclude overdrafts and highlight our efforts to grow our lending portfolio, averaged $24.04 billion in 2020 compared to $19.95 billion in 2019.\nAverage other interest-earning assets, largely associated with our enhanced custody business, decreased to $11.26 billion in 2020 from $14.16 billion in 2019, primarily driven by a reduction in the level of cash collateral posted. Enhanced custody is our securities financing business where we act as principal with respect to our custody clients and generate securities finance revenue. The NII earned on these transactions is generally lower than the interest earned on other alternative investments.\nAggregate average total interest-bearing deposits increased to $156.25 billion in 2020 from $128.85 billion in 2019. Average U.S. interest-bearing deposits increased as a result of the market uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of global interest rates and new deposit gathering initiatives. While deposits levels moderated in the second half of 2020, deposits levels remained elevated throughout 2020 and we expect deposits to remain elevated within the current environment of low interest rates and continued expansion of the money supply by the Federal Reserve. Future deposit levels will be influenced by the underlying asset servicing business, client deposit\nbehavior and market conditions, including the general levels of U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates.\nAverage other short-term borrowings, typically associated with our tax-exempt investment program, increased to $2.23 billion in 2020  from $1.52 billion in 2019.\nAverage long-term debt was $14.37 billion in 2020 compared to $11.47 billion in 2019. These amounts reflect issuances, redemptions and maturities of senior debt during the respective periods, including the issuance of $750 million of senior debt in January 2020 and $1.75 billion in March 2020.\nAverage other interest-bearing liabilities were $3.18 billion in 2020 compared to $4.10 billion in 2019. Other interest-bearing liabilities primarily reflect our level of cash collateral received from clients in connection with our enhanced custody business, which is presented on a net basis where we have enforceable netting agreements.\nState Street Corporation | 70\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSeveral factors could affect future levels of NII and NIM, including the volume and mix of client deposits and funding sources; central bank actions; balance sheet management activities; changes in the level and slope of U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates; revised or proposed regulatory capital or liquidity standards, or interpretations of those standards; the yields earned on securities purchased compared to the yields earned on securities sold or matured and changes in the type and amount of credit or other loans we extend.\nBased on market conditions and other factors, including regulatory standards, we continue to reinvest the majority of the proceeds from pay-downs and maturities of investment securities in highly-rated U.S. and non-U.S. securities, such as  federal agency MBS, sovereign debt securities and U.S. Treasury and agency securities. The pace at which we reinvest and the types of investment securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions, the implementation of regulatory standards, including interpretation of those standards and other factors over time. We expect these factors and the levels of global interest rates to impact our reinvestment program and future levels of NII and NIM.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nIn January 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n, which replaced the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the CECL methodology. The impact of transitioning to ASC 326 on the consolidated financial statements was an increase in the allowance for credit losses and a decrease in retained earnings of $3 million as of January 1, 2020. In 2020, we recorded a provision of $88 million for credit losses related to loans and financial assets held at amortized cost and off-balance sheet commitments based on the CECL methodology, reflecting both downward credit migration within our loan portfolio and revision in management’s economic outlook reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This compares to a $10 million provision for credit losses in 2019 and $15 million in 2018, which were under the incurred loss model.\nAdditional information is provided under “Loans and Leases” in \"Financial Condition\" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis and in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nExpenses\nTable 8: Expenses, provides the breakout of expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n(1)\nCRD contributed approximately $248 million in total expenses in 2020, approximately $201 million in total expenses in 2019 and approximately $39 million in total expenses in 2018, which reflects their results from October 1, 2018, the date of acquisition, through December 31, 2018.\nCompensation and employee benefits expenses decreased 2% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower headcount in high cost locations, lower contractor spend and lower repositioning charges, partially offset by higher incentive compensation.\nTotal headcount increased by approximately 1% as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, primarily driven by hires in global hubs, partially offset by a reduction in high cost locations.\nInformation systems and communications expenses increased 6% in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily related to higher software costs and technology infrastructure investments.\nTransaction processing services expenses  decreased 1% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher vendor savings, partially offset by higher broker fees and sub-custody costs.\nOccupancy expenses increased 4% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher repositioning charges, partially offset by benefits from the advancement of our global footprint strategy.\nAmortization of other intangible assets decreased 1% in 2020 compared to 2019.\nOther expenses decreased 24% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by lower legal expenses, marketing and travel costs, partially offset by higher professional fees.\nState Street Corporation | 71\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAcquisition Costs\nWe recorded approximately $54 million of acquisition costs in 2020 compared to $79 million in  2019 and $31 million in 2018, related to our acquisition of CRD. As we integrate CRD into our business, we expect to incur a total of approximately $225 million of acquisition costs through 2021, after which we will no longer distinguish certain CRD costs as acquisition costs. As of December 31, 2020, we have incurred $164 million of acquisition costs related to CRD. We expect to incur any remaining significant acquisition costs related to CRD in 2021.\nRestructuring and Repositioning Charges\nRepositioning Charges\nExpenses for 2020 included a repositioning charge of $133 million, consisting of $82 million of compensation and employee benefits and $51 million of occupancy expenses. In January 2021, we announced that we expect to eliminate approximately 1,200 positions, mostly in middle management, which will be partially offset by in-sourcing and critical hires, during 2021. These actions are expected to result in savings of approximately $150 million in 2021 due to automation of processes and organizational simplification enabling workforce rationalization and reduction of our real estate footprint by approximately 13% of our total square footage. Total repositioning charges were $110 million in 2019.\nThe following table presents aggregate activity for repositioning charges and activity related to previous Beacon restructuring charges for the periods indicated:\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $479 million in 2020 compared to $470 million in 2019. Our effective tax rate was 16.5% in 2020, compared to 17.3% in 2019. The effective tax rate for 2020 included a benefit from the use of foreign tax credits. The effective tax rate for 2019 included a benefit attributable to a foreign legal entity restructuring which was partially offset by legal accruals and limitations on foreign tax credit benefits.\nAdditional information regarding income tax expense, including unrecognized tax benefits and tax contingencies, are provided in Notes 13 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nLINE OF BUSINESS INFORMATION\nOur operations are organized into two lines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management, which are defined based on products and services provided. The results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial services industry.\nInvestment Servicing,\nthrough\nState Street Institutional Services, State Street Global Markets, State Street Global Exchange and CRD, provides services for institutional clients, including mutual funds, collective investment funds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, investment managers, foundations and endowments worldwide. Products include: custody; product accounting; daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; depotbank services (a fund oversight role created by non-U.S. regulation); record-keeping; cash management; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance and enhanced custody products; deposit and short-term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance analytics; and financial data management to support institutional investors.\nIncluded within our Investment Servicing line of business is CRD, which we acquired in October 2018. The Charles River Investment Management solution is a technology offering which is designed to automate and simplify the institutional investment process across asset classes, from portfolio management and risk analytics through trading and post-trade settlement, with integrated compliance and managed data throughout. With the acquisition of CRD, we took the first step in building our front-to-back platform, State Street Alpha. Today our State Street Alpha platform combines portfolio management, trading and execution, advanced data aggregation, analytics and compliance tools, and integration with other industry platforms and providers.\nState Street Corporation | 72\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInvestment Management\n, through State Street Global Advisors, provides a broad range of investment management strategies and products for our clients. Our investment management strategies and products span the risk/reward spectrum for equity, fixed income and cash assets, including core and enhanced indexing, multi-asset strategies, active quantitative and fundamental active capabilities and alternative investment strategies. Our AUM is currently primarily weighted to indexed strategies. In addition, we provide a breadth of services and solutions, including environmental, social and governance investing, defined benefit and defined contribution and Global Fiduciary Solutions (formerly Outsourced Chief Investment Officer). State Street Global Advisors is also a provider of ETFs, including the SPDR\n®\nETF brand. While management fees are primarily determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees.\nFor information about our two lines of business, as well as the revenues, expenses and capital allocation methodologies associated with them, refer to Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nInvestment Servicing\n(1)\nCRD contributed approximately $420 million and $248 million in total revenue and total expenses, respectively, in 2020, approximately $385 million and $201 million in total revenue and total expenses, respectively, in 2019 and approximately $119 million and $39 million in total revenue and total expenses, respectively, in 2018, which reflects their results from October 1, 2018, the date of acquisition, through December 31, 2018.\nnm\nNot meaningful\nServicing Fees\nServicing fees, as presented in Table 10: Investment Servicing Line of Business Results, increased 2% in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher average market levels and client activity, primarily in the first half of 2020, partially offset by normal pricing headwinds.  FX rates impacted servicing fees positively by 1% in 2020 relative to 2019 and negatively by 1% in 2019 relative to 2018.\nServicing fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 47% of total servicing fees in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nState Street Corporation | 73\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(1)\nGeographic mix is generally based on the domicile of the entity servicing the funds and is not necessarily representative of the underlying asset mix.\nAsset servicing mandates newly announced in 2020 totaled approximately $787 billion, with an increasing proportion incorporating State Street Alpha, compared to $1.84 trillion in 2019. Servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately $436 billion as of December 31, 2020, which will be reflected in AUC/A in future periods after installation and will generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods. The full revenue impact of such mandates will be realized over several quarters as the assets are installed and additional services are added over that period.\nNew asset servicing mandates may be subject to completion of definitive agreements, approval of applicable boards and shareholders and customary regulatory approvals. New asset servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods exclude certain new business which has been contracted, but for which the client has not yet provided permission to publicly disclose and the expected installation date extends beyond one quarter. These excluded assets, which from time to time may be significant, will be included in new asset servicing mandates and reflected in servicing assets remaining to be installed in the period in which the client provides its permission. Servicing mandates and servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods are presented on a gross basis and therefore also do not include the impact of clients who have notified us during the period of their intent to terminate or reduce their relationship with us, which may from time to time be significant.\nWith respect to these new servicing mandates, once installed we may provide various services, including accounting, bank loan servicing, compliance reporting and monitoring, custody, depository banking services, FX, fund administration, hedge fund servicing, middle office outsourcing, performance and analytics, private equity administration, real estate administration, securities finance, transfer agency and wealth management services. Revenues associated with new servicing mandates may vary based on the breadth of services provided and the timing of installation, and the types of assets.\nAs a result of a decision to diversify providers, one of our large asset servicing clients has advised us it expects to move a significant portion of its ETF assets currently with State Street to one or more other providers, pending necessary approvals. We expect to continue as a significant service provider for this client after this transition and for the client to continue to be meaningful to our business. The transition is expected to begin in 2022 but will principally occur in 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the fee revenue associated with the transitioning assets represented approximately 1.5% of our total fee revenue. The total revenue and income impact of this transition will depend upon a range of factors, including potential growth in our continuing business with the client and expense reductions associated with the transition.\nFor additional information about the impact of worldwide equity and fixed-income valuations on our fee revenue, as well as other key drivers of our servicing fee revenue, refer to \"Fee Revenue\" in \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nForeign Exchange Trading Services\nForeign exchange trading services revenue, as presented in Table 10: Investment Servicing Line of Business Results, increased 33% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher volumes and market volatility. Foreign exchange trading services is composed of revenue generated by FX trading and revenue generated by brokerage and other trading services, which made up 68% and 32%, respectively, of foreign exchange trading services revenue in 2020.\nWe primarily earn FX trading revenue by acting as a principal market-maker through both \"direct sales and trading” and “indirect FX trading.”\n•\nDirect sales and trading\n: Represent FX transactions at negotiated rates with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly. These principal market-making activities include transactions for funds serviced by third party custodians or prime brokers, as well as those funds under custody with us.\n•\nIndirect FX trading\n: Represents FX transactions with clients, for which we are the funds' custodian, or their investment managers, routed to our FX desk through our asset-servicing operation. We execute indirect FX trades as a principal at rates disclosed to our clients.\nState Street Corporation | 74\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur FX trading revenue is influenced by multiple factors, including: the volume and type of client FX transactions and related spreads; currency volatility, reflecting market conditions; and our management of exchange rate, interest rate and other market risks associated with our FX activities. The relative impact of these factors on our total FX trading revenues often differs from period to period. For example, assuming all other factors remain constant, increases or decreases in volumes or bid-offer spreads across product mix tend to result in increases or decreases, as the case may be, in client-related FX revenue.\nOur clients that utilize indirect FX trading can, in addition to executing their FX transactions through dealers not affiliated with us, transition from indirect FX trading to either direct sales and trading execution, including our “Street FX” service, or to one of our electronic trading platforms. Street FX, in which we continue to act as a principal market-maker, enables our clients to define their FX execution strategy and automate the FX trade execution process, both for funds under custody with us as well as those under custody at another bank.\nWe also earn foreign exchange trading services revenue through \"electronic FX services\" and \"other trading, transition management and brokerage revenue.\"\n•\nElectronic FX services: Our clients may choose to execute FX transactions through one of our electronic trading platforms. These transactions generate revenue through a “click” fee.\n•\nOther trading, transition management and brokerage revenue: As our clients look to us to enhance and preserve portfolio values, they may choose to utilize our Transition or Currency Management capabilities or transact with our Equity Trade execution group. These transactions, which are not limited to foreign exchange, generate revenue via commissions charged for trades transacted during the management of these portfolios.\nSecurities Finance\nOur securities finance business consists of three components:\n(1) an agency lending program for State Street Global Advisors managed investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives, which we refer to as the State Street Global Advisors lending funds;\n(2) an agency lending program for third-party investment managers and asset owners, which we refer to as the agency lending funds; and\n(3) security lending transactions which we enter into as principal, which we refer to as our enhanced custody business.\nSecurities finance revenue earned from our agency lending activities, which is composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to non-cash collateral, is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan, the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral and our share of the fee split.\nAs principal, our enhanced custody business borrows securities from the lending client or other market participants and then lends such securities to the subsequent borrower, either our client or a broker/dealer. We act as principal when the lending client is unable to, or elects not to, transact directly with the market and execute the transaction and furnish the securities. In our role as principal, we provide support to the transaction through our credit rating. While we source a significant proportion of the securities furnished by us in our role as principal from third parties, we have the ability to source securities through assets under custody from clients who have designated us as an eligible borrower.\nSecurities finance revenue, as presented in Table 10: Investment Servicing Line of Business Results, decreased 26% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting decreases in enhanced custody balances due to client deleveraging and lower agency lending revenues due to lower spreads.\nMarket influences may continue to affect client demand for securities finance, and as a result our revenue from, and the profitability of, our securities lending activities in future periods. In addition, the constantly evolving regulatory environment, including revised or proposed capital and liquidity standards, interpretations of those standards, and our own balance sheet management activities, may influence modifications to the way in which we deliver our agency lending or enhanced custody businesses, the volume of our securities lending activity and related revenue and profitability in future periods.\nSoftware and Processing Fees\nSoftware and processing fees revenue includes diverse types of fees and revenue, including fees from software licensing and maintenance, fees from our structured products business and other revenue including equity income from our joint venture investments, gains and losses on sales of other assets, market-related adjustments and income associated with certain tax-advantaged investments.\nState Street Corporation | 75\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSoftware and processing fees revenue, presented in Table 10: Investment Servicing Line of Business Results, increased 2% in 2020 compared to 2019 and reflects approximately $406 million from CRD in 2020. We acquired CRD on October 1, 2018. Revenue related to the front office solutions provided by CRD is primarily driven by the sale of term software licenses and software as service arrangements, including professional services such as consulting and implementation services, software support and maintenance. Approximately 50%-70% of revenue associated with a sale of software to be installed on-premise is recognized at a point in time when the customer benefits from obtaining access to and use of the software license, with the percentage varying based on the length of the contract and other contractual terms. The remainder of revenue for on-premise installations is recognized over the length of the contract as maintenance and other services are provided. Upon renewal of an on-premises software contract, the same pattern of revenue recognition is followed with 50%-70% recognized upon renewal and the balance recognized over the term of the contract. Revenue for a Software as a Service (SaaS) related arrangement, where the customer does not take possession of the software, is recognized over the term of the contract as services are provided. Upon renewal of a SaaS arrangement, revenue continues to be recognized as services are provided under the new contract. As a result of these differences in how portions of CRD revenue are accounted for, CRD revenue may vary more than other business units quarter to quarter. CRD contributed approximately $420 million in total revenue in 2020, compared to approximately $385 million in 2019, including approximately $370 million in software and processing fees and $15 million  in brokerage and other trading services within foreign exchange trading services. The increase in revenue is primarily driven by SaaS revenue and professional services.\nAmortization of tax advantage investments negatively impacted software and processing fees by approximately $88 million and $52 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn addition, FX and market-related adjustments, which also includes certain fair value adjustments, impacted software and processing fees by approximately $26 million and $16 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses for Investment Servicing decreased 1% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to on-going expense management initiatives, partially offset by technology infrastructure and operational investments. Total expenses contributed by CRD in 2020 were approximately $248 million, compared to $201 million in 2019. Additional information about expenses is provided under \"Expenses\" in \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nInvestment Management\n(1)\nCertain fees associated with our GLD ETFs have been reclassified from Foreign exchange trading services to Management fees to better reflect the nature of those fees. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation. These fees were approximately $81 million, $53 million and $48 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(2)\nIncludes revenues from SPDR® Gold Shares and SPDR® Gold MiniSharesSM Trust AUM where we are not the investment manager but act as the marketing agent.\n(3)\nIncludes revenue for reimbursements received for certain ETFs associated with State Street Global Advisors where we act as the distribution and marketing agent.\n(4)\nIncludes other revenue items that are primarily driven by equity market movements.\nnm\nNot meaningful\nInvestment Management total revenue increased 3%  in 2020 compared to 2019.\nState Street Corporation | 76\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement Fees\nManagement fees increased 3% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher average market levels and ETF and cash net inflows, partially offset by net institutional outflows.\nManagement fees generated outside the U.S. were approximately 26% of total management fees in 2020 compared to approximately 27% in both 2019 and 2018.\n(1)\nIncludes both floating- and constant-net-asset-value portfolios held in commingled structures or separate accounts.\n(2)\nIncludes real estate investment trusts, currency and commodities, including SPDR\n®\nGold Shares and SPDR\n®\nGold MiniSharesSM Trust. We are not the investment manager for the SPDR\n®\nGold Shares and SPDR\n®\nGold\nMiniSharesSM Trust, but act as the marketing agent.\n(1)\nETFs are a component of AUM presented in the preceding table.\n(2)\nIncludes real estate investment trusts, currency and commodities, including SPDR\n®\nGold Shares and SPDR\n®\nGold MiniSharesSM Trust. We are not the investment manager for the SPDR\n®\nGold Shares and SPDR\n®\nGold\nMiniSharesSM Trust, but act as the marketing agent.\n(1)\nGeographic mix is based on client location or fund management location.\nState Street Corporation | 77\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(1)\nIncludes both floating- and constant-net-asset-value portfolios held in commingled structures or separate accounts.\n(2)\nIncludes real estate investment trusts, currency and commodities, including SPDR\n®\nGold Shares and SPDR\n®\nGold MiniSharesSM Trust. We are not the investment manager for the SPDR\n®\nGold Shares and SPDR\n®\nGold\nMiniSharesSM Trust, but act as the marketing agent.\n(3)\nAmounts represent long-term portfolios, excluding ETFs.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses for Investment Management decreased 4% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to savings  from on-going expense management initiatives.\nAdditional information about expenses is provided under \"Expenses\" in \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nState Street Corporation | 78\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our Investment Servicing and Investment Management lines of business. Our clients' needs and our operating objectives determine balance sheet volume, mix and currency denomination. As our clients execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities, they utilize deposits and short-term investments that constitute the majority of our liabilities. These liabilities are generally in the form of interest-bearing transaction account deposits, which are denominated in a variety of currencies; non-interest-bearing demand deposits; and repurchase agreements, which generally serve as short-term investment alternatives for our clients.\nDeposits and other liabilities resulting from client initiated transactions are invested in assets that generally have contractual maturities significantly longer than our liabilities; however, we evaluate the operational nature of our deposits and seek to maintain appropriate short-term liquidity of those liabilities that are not operational in nature and maintain longer-termed assets for our operational deposits. Our assets consist primarily of securities held in our AFS or HTM portfolios and short-duration financial instruments, such as interest-bearing deposits with banks and securities purchased under resale agreements. The actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire to maintain a well-diversified portfolio of high-quality assets.\nTABLE 19: AVERAGE STATEMENT OF CONDITION\n(1)\n(1)\nAdditional information about our average statement of condition, primarily our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, is provided in \"Net Interest Income\" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.\n(2)\nTotal deposits averaged $193.23 billion in 2020\ncompared to $158.26 billion and $161.41 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nState Street Corporation | 79\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInvestment Securities\n(1)\nPrimarily comprised of securities guaranteed by the federal government with respect to at least 97% of defaulted principal and accrued interest on the underlying loans.\n(2)\nIncludes securities at amortized cost or fair value on the date of transfer from AFS.\n(3)\nConsists entirely of U.S. securities\n.\nAdditional information about our investment securities portfolio is provided in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nWe manage our investment securities portfolio to align with the interest rate and duration characteristics of our client liabilities and in the context of the overall structure of our consolidated statement of condition, in consideration of the global interest rate environment. We consider a well-diversified, high-credit quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our consolidated statement of condition.\nAverage duration of our investment securities portfolio was 3.0 years and 2.7 years as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase in securities duration is primarily driven by continued growth in the investment portfolio.\nApproximately 92% and 90% of the carrying value of the portfolio was rated “AAA” or “AA” as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n(1)\nIncludes U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities that are split-rated, “AAA” by Moody’s Investors Service and “AA+” by Standard & Poor’s and also includes Agency MBS securities which are not explicitly rated but which have an explicit or assumed guarantee from the U.S. government.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the investment portfolio was diversified with respect to asset class composition. The following table presents the composition of these asset classes.\n(1)\nIncludes the securities purchased under the MMLF program.\nNon-U.S. Debt Securities\nApproximately 27% of the aggregate carrying value of our investment securities portfolio was non-U.S. debt securities as of both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nState Street Corporation | 80\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(1)\nConsists entirely of supranational bonds.\n(2)\nIncluded approximately $2,166 million and $618 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, related to\nsupranational bonds\n.\n(3)\nIncluded approximately $45 million and $46 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, related to Italy and Portugal, all of which were related to MBS.\nApproximately 80% and 74% of the aggregate carrying value of these non-U.S. debt securities was rated “AAA” or “AA” as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The majority of these securities comprised senior positions within the security structures; these positions have a level of protection provided through subordination and other forms of credit protection. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, approximately 21% and 27%, respectively, of the aggregate carrying value of these non-U.S. debt securities was floating-rate.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our non-U.S. debt securities had an average market-to-book ratio of 101.5%, and an aggregate pre-tax net unrealized gain of $439 million, composed of gross unrealized gains of $452 million and gross unrealized losses of $13 million. These unrealized amounts included:\n•\na pre-tax net unrealized gain of $375 million, composed of gross unrealized gains of $384 million and gross unrealized losses of $9 million, associated with non-U.S. AFS debt securities; and\n•\na pre-tax net unrealized gain of $64 million, composed of gross unrealized gains of $68 million and gross unrealized losses of $4 million, associated with non-U.S. HTM debt securities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the underlying collateral for non-U.S. MBS and ABS primarily included U.K., Australian, Italian and Dutch mortgages. The securities listed under “Canada” were composed of Canadian government securities and provincial bonds, corporate debt and non-U.S. agency securities. The securities listed under “France” were composed of sovereign bonds, corporate debt, covered bonds, ABS and Non-U.S. agency securities. The securities listed under “Japan” were substantially composed of Japanese government securities.\nMunicipal Obligations\nWe carried approximately $1.5 billion of municipal securities classified as state and political subdivisions in our investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2020, as shown in Table 20: Carrying Values of Investment Securities, all of which were classified as AFS. As of December 31, 2020, we also provided approximately $9.4 billion of credit and liquidity facilities to municipal issuers.\n(1)\nRepresented 5% or more of our aggregate municipal credit exposure of approximately $11.06 billion and $11.32 billion across our businesses as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n(2)\nIncludes approximately $0.08 billion of municipal HTM MMLF securities.\n(3)\nIncludes municipal loans which are also presented within Table 26: U.S. and Non-U.S. Loans and Leases.\nState Street Corporation | 81\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur aggregate municipal securities exposure presented in Table 24: State and Municipal Obligors, was concentrated primarily with highly-rated counterparties, with approximately 87% of the obligors rated “AAA” or “AA” as of December 31, 2020. As of that date, approximately 26% and 74% of our aggregate municipal securities exposure was associated with general obligation and revenue bonds, respectively. The portfolios are also diversified geographically, with the states that represent our largest exposures widely dispersed across the U.S.\nAdditional information with respect to our assessment of impairment of our municipal securities is provided in Note 3\nto the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\n(1)\nThe maturities of MBS, ABS and CMOs are based on expected principal payments.\n(2)\nYields were calculated on a FTE basis, using applicable statutory tax rates (21.0% as of December 31, 2020).\nState Street Corporation | 82\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLoans and Leases\n(1)\nDomestic and foreign categorization is based on the borrower’s country of domicile.\n(2)\nWe wound down our lease financing business in 2018.\n(3)\nIncludes  $2,982 million and $3,256 million  of overdrafts as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n(4)\nAs of December 31, 2020, floating rate loans totaled $22,537 million and fixed rate loans totaled $2,404 million.\nThe increase in domestic loans in the commercial and financial segment as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 was primarily driven by an  increase in fund finance loans, partially offset by a decrease in securities finance loans.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our leveraged loans totaled approximately $4.17 billion and $4.46 billion, respectively. We sold $353 million leveraged loans in 2020. We recorded  a charge-off against the allowance for these loans prior to the sale of these loans of $41 million  in 2020.\nIn addition, we had binding unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 of $149 million and $176 million, respectively, to participate in such syndications. Additional information about these unfunded commitments is provided in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nThese leveraged loans, which are primarily rated “speculative” under our internal risk-rating framework (refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K), are externally rated “BBB,” “BB” or “B,” with approximately 85% and 86% of the loans rated “BB” or “B” as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Our investment strategy involves generally limiting our investment to larger, more liquid credits underwritten by major global financial institutions, applying our internal credit analysis process to each potential investment and diversifying our exposure by counterparty and industry segment. However, these loans have significant exposure to credit losses relative to higher-rated loans in our portfolio.\nAdditional information about all of our loan segments, as well as underlying classes, is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nNo loans were modified in troubled debt restructurings as of both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nAllowance for credit losses\n(1)\nBeginning January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13. Prior to 2020, we recognized an allowance for loan losses under an incurred loss model. Upon adoption, we increased the allowance and reduced retained earnings by approximately $2 million. As such, the beginning balance differs from the December 31, 2019 ending balance. Please refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for additional information.\n(2)\nThe provision for credit losses is primarily related to commercial and financial loans.\n(3)\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the provision for unfunded commitments was recorded within other expenses in the consolidated statement of income. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 in the first quarter of 2020, the provision for all assets within scope is recorded within the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statement of income.\n(4)\nThe charge-offs are related to commercial and financial loans.\nState Street Corporation | 83\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs discussed above, we adopted ASU 2016-13 in January 2020. For additional information on this new standard, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. The provision for credit losses related to loans and financial assets held at amortized cost, including investment securities classified as HTM and off-balance sheet commitments, was $88 million in 2020 based on the CECL methodology, compared to $10 million in 2019 (which was under the previous incurred loss model).\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately $97 million of our allowance for credit losses was related to leveraged loans included in the commercial and financial segment compared to $61 million as of December 31, 2019, reflecting changes in reserving standards and economic outlook, as well as negative credit migration. As our view on current and future economic scenarios change, our allowance for credit losses related to these loans may be impacted through a change to the provisions for credit losses, reflecting credit migration within our loan portfolio, as well as changes in management's economic outlook as of year-end.  The remaining $51 million and $13 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was related to off-balance sheet commitments and other financial assets held at amortized cost, including investment securities held to maturity.\nAn allowance for credit losses is recognized on HTM securities upon acquisition of the security, and on AFS securities when the fair value and expected future cash flows of the investment securities are less than their amortized cost basis. Please refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for additional information. Our assessment of impairment involves an evaluation of economic and security-specific factors. Such factors are based on estimates, derived by management, which contemplate current market conditions and security-specific performance. To the extent that market conditions are worse than management's expectations or due to idiosyncratic bond performance, the credit-related component of impairment, in particular, could increase and would be recorded in the provision for credit losses. Additional information with respect to the allowance for credit losses, net impairment losses and gross unrealized losses is provided in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nCross-Border Outstandings\nCross-border outstandings are amounts payable to us by non-U.S. counterparties which are denominated in U.S. dollars or other non-local currency, as well as non-U.S. local currency claims not funded by local currency liabilities. Our cross-border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks; loans and lease financing, including short-\nduration advances; investment securities; amounts related to FX and interest rate contracts; and securities finance.\nIn addition to credit risk, cross-border outstandings have the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and/or interest when due because of the unavailability of, or restrictions on, FX needed by borrowers to repay their obligations.\nAs market and economic conditions change, the major independent credit rating agencies may downgrade U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions and sovereign issuers which have been, and may in the future be, significant counterparties to us, or whose financial instruments serve as collateral on which we rely for credit risk mitigation purposes, and may do so again in the future. As a result, we may be exposed to increased counterparty risk, leading to negative ratings volatility.\nThe cross-border outstandings presented in Table 30: Cross-border outstandings, represented approximately 30% and 28% of our consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n(1)\nCross-border outstandings included countries in which we do business, and which amounted to at least 1% of our consolidated total assets as of the dates indicated.\nState Street Corporation | 84\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs of December 31, 2020, aggregate cross-border outstandings in each of Switzerland and Ireland amounted to between 0.75% and 1% of our consolidated assets, at approximately $3.13 billion and $2.93 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, aggregate cross-border outstandings in the Netherlands amounted to between 0.75% and 1% of our consolidated assets, at approximately $1.89 billion. As of December 31, 2018, there were no countries whose aggregate cross-border outstandings amounted to between 0.75% and 1% of our consolidated assets.\nRisk Management\nGeneral\nIn the normal course of our global business activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some inherent in the financial services industry, others more specific to our business activities. Our risk management framework focuses on material risks, which include the following:\n•\ncredit and counterparty risk;\n•\nliquidity risk, funding and management;\n•\noperational risk;\n•\ninformation technology risk;\n•\nmarket risk associated with our trading activities;\n•\nmarket risk associated with our non-trading activities, which we refer to as asset and liability management, and which consists primarily of interest rate risk;\n•\nstrategic risk;\n•\nmodel risk; and\n•\nreputational, fiduciary and business conduct risk.\nMany of these risks, as well as certain factors underlying each of these risks that could affect our businesses and our consolidated financial statements, are discussed in detail under \"Risk Factors\" in this Form 10-K.\nThe scope of our business requires that we balance these risks with a comprehensive and well-integrated risk management function. The identification, assessment, monitoring, mitigation and reporting of risks are essential to our financial performance and successful management of our businesses. These risks, if not effectively managed, can result in losses to us as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation. Our approach, including Board and senior management oversight and a system of policies, procedures, limits, risk measurement and monitoring and internal controls, allows for an assessment of risks within a framework\nfor evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital that appropriately balances risk and return.\nOur objective is to optimize our return while operating at a prudent level of risk. In support of this objective, we have instituted a risk appetite framework that aligns our business strategy and financial objectives with the level of risk that we are willing to incur.\nOur risk management is based on the following major goals:\n•\nA culture of risk awareness that extends across all of our business activities;\n•\nThe identification, classification and quantification of our material risks;\n•\nThe establishment of our risk appetite and associated limits and policies, and our compliance with these limits;\n•\nThe establishment of a risk management structure at the “top of the house” that enables the control and coordination of risk-taking across the business lines;\n•\nThe implementation of stress testing practices and a dynamic risk-assessment capability;\n•\nA direct link between risk and strategic-decision making processes and incentive compensation practices; and\n•\nThe overall flexibility to adapt to the ever-changing business and market conditions.\nOur risk appetite framework outlines the quantitative limits and qualitative goals that define our risk appetite, as well as the responsibilities for measuring and monitoring risk against limits, and for reporting, escalating, approving and addressing exceptions. Our risk appetite framework is established by ERM, a corporate risk oversight group, in conjunction with the MRAC and the RC of the Board. The Board formally reviews and approves our risk appetite statement annually, or more frequently as required.\nThe risk appetite framework describes the level and types of risk that we are willing to accommodate in executing our business strategy, and also serves as a guide in setting risk limits across our business units. In addition to our risk appetite framework, we use stress testing as another important tool in our risk management practice. Additional information with respect to our stress testing process and practices is provided under “Capital” in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nState Street Corporation | 85\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGovernance and Structure\nWe have an approach to risk management that involves all levels of management, from the Board and its committees, including its E&A Committee, RC, the HRC and TOPS, to each business unit and each employee. We allocate responsibility for risk oversight so that risk/return decisions are made at an appropriate level, and are subject to robust and effective review and challenge. Risk management is the responsibility of each employee, and is implemented through three lines of defense: the business units, which own and manage the risks inherent in their business, are considered the first line of defense; ERM and other support functions, such as Compliance, Finance and Vendor Management, provide the second line of defense; and Corporate Audit, which assesses the effectiveness of the first two lines of defense.\nThe responsibilities for effective review and challenge reside with senior managers, management oversight committees, Corporate Audit and, ultimately, the Board and its committees. While we believe that our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses, internal and external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated.\nCorporate-level risk committees provide focused oversight, and establish corporate standards and policies for specific risks, including credit, sovereign exposure, market, liquidity, operational, information technology as well as new business products, regulatory compliance and ethics, vendor risk and model risks. These committees have been delegated the responsibility to develop recommendations and remediation strategies to address issues that affect or have the potential to affect us.\nWe maintain a risk governance committee structure which serves as the formal governance mechanism through which we seek to undertake the consistent identification, management and mitigation of various risks facing us in connection with its business activities. This governance structure is enhanced and integrated through multi-disciplinary involvement, particularly through ERM. The following chart presents this structure.\nState Street Corporation | 86\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEnterprise Risk Management\nThe goal of ERM is to ensure that risks are proactively identified, well-understood and prudently managed in support of our business strategy. ERM provides risk oversight, support and coordination to allow for the consistent identification, measurement and management of risks across business units separate from the business units' activities, and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of corporate-wide risk management policies and guidelines. In addition, ERM establishes and reviews limits and, in collaboration with business unit management, monitors key risks. Ultimately, ERM works to validate that risk-taking occurs within the risk appetite statement approved by the Board and conforms to associated risk policies, limits and guidelines.\nThe Chief Risk Officer (CRO) is responsible for our risk management globally, leads ERM and has a dual reporting line to our CEO and the Board’s RC. ERM manages its responsibilities globally through a three-dimensional organization structure:\n•\n“Vertical” business unit-aligned risk groups that support business managers with risk management, measurement and monitoring activities;\n•\n“Horizontal” risk groups that monitor the risks that cross all of our business units (for example, credit and operational risk); and\n•\nRisk oversight for international activities, which combines intersecting “Verticals” and “Horizontals” through a hub and spoke model to provide important regional and legal entity perspectives to the global risk framework.\nSitting on top of this three-dimensional organization structure is a centralized group responsible for the aggregation of risk exposures across the vertical, horizontal and regional dimensions, for consolidated reporting, for setting the corporate-level risk appetite framework and associated limits and policies, and for dynamic risk assessment across our business.\nBoard Committees\nThe Board has four committees which assist it in discharging its responsibilities with respect to risk management: the Risk Committee (RC), the Examining and Audit Committee (E&A Committee), the Human Resources Committee (HRC) and the Technology and Operations Committee (TOPS).\nThe RC is responsible for oversight related to the operation of our global risk management framework, including policies and procedures establishing risk management governance and processes and risk control infrastructure for our global operations. The RC is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management our assessment and\nmanagement of all risks applicable to our operations, including credit, market, interest rate, liquidity, operational, regulatory, technology, business, compliance and reputation risks, and related policies.\nIn addition, the RC provides oversight of capital policies, capital planning and balance sheet management, resolution planning and monitors capital adequacy in relation to risk. The RC is also responsible for discharging the duties and obligations of the Board under applicable Basel and other regulatory requirements.\nThe E&A Committee oversees management's operation of our comprehensive system of internal controls covering the integrity of our consolidated financial statements and reports, compliance with laws, regulations and corporate policies. The E&A Committee acts on behalf of the Board in monitoring and overseeing the performance of Corporate Audit and in reviewing certain communications with banking regulators. The E&A Committee has direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation, retention, evaluation and oversight of the work of our independent registered public accounting firm, including sole authority for the establishment of pre-approval policies and procedures for all audit engagements and any non-audit engagements.\nThe HRC has direct responsibility for the oversight of human capital management, all compensation plans, policies and programs in which executive officers participate and incentive, retirement, welfare as well as equity plans in which certain of our other employees participate. In addition, the HRC oversees the alignment of our incentive compensation arrangements with our safety and soundness, including the integration of risk management objectives, and related policies, arrangements and control processes consistent with applicable related regulatory rules and guidance.\nThe TOPS leads and assists in the Board’s oversight of technology and operational risk management and the role of these risks in executing our strategy and supporting our global business requirements. The TOPS reviews strategic initiatives from a technology and operational risk perspective and  reviews and approves technology-related risk matters. In addition, TOPS reviews matters related to corporate information security and cyber-security programs, operational and technology resiliency, data and access management and third-party risk management.\nState Street Corporation | 87\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Management Committees\nMRAC is the senior management decision-making body for risk and capital issues, and oversees our financial risks, our consolidated statement of condition, and our capital adequacy, liquidity and recovery and resolution planning. Its responsibilities include:\n•\nThe approval of the policies of our global risk, capital and liquidity management frameworks, including our risk appetite framework;\n•\nThe monitoring and assessment of our capital adequacy based on internal policies and regulatory requirements;\n•\nThe oversight of our firm-wide risk identification, model risk governance, stress testing and Recovery and Resolution Plan programs; and\n•\nThe ongoing monitoring and review of risks undertaken within the businesses, and our senior management oversight and approval of risk strategies and tactics.\nMRAC is co-chaired by our CRO and Chief Financial Officer, who regularly present to the RC on developments in the risk environment and performance trends in our key business areas.\nBCC provides oversight of our business conduct and culture risks and standards, our commitments to clients and others with whom we do business, and our potential reputational risks, on an enterprise-wide basis. Management considers adherence to high ethical standards to be critical to the success of our business and to our reputation. The BCC is co-chaired by our Chief Compliance Officer and our General Counsel.\nTORC provides oversight of, and assesses the effectiveness of, corporate-wide technology and operational risk management programs, and reviews areas of improvement to manage and control technology and operational risk consistently across the organization. TORC is co-chaired by the Chief Operating Officer and the Chief Risk Officer.\nRisk Committees\nThe following risk committees, under the oversight of the respective executive management committees, have focused responsibilities for oversight of specific areas of risk management:\nManagement Risk and Capital Committee\n•\nALCO is the senior corporate oversight and decision-making body for balance sheet strategy, Global Treasury business activities and risk management for interest rate risk, liquidity risk and non-trading market risk. ALCO’s roles and responsibilities are designed to be complementary to, and in\ncoordination with the MRAC, which approves the corporate risk appetite and associated balance sheet strategy;\n•\nCRPC has primary responsibility for the oversight and review of credit and counterparty risk across business units, as well as oversight, review and approval of the credit risk policies and guidelines; the Committee consists of senior executives within ERM, and reviews policies and guidelines related to all aspects of our business which give rise to credit risk; our business units are also represented on the CRPC; credit risk policies and guidelines are reviewed periodically, but at least annually;\n•\nTMRC reviews the effectiveness of, and approves, the market risk framework at least annually; it is the senior oversight and decision-making committee for risk management within our global markets businesses; the TMRC is responsible for the formulation of guidelines, strategies and workflows with respect to the measurement, monitoring and control of our trading market risk, and also approves market risk tolerance limits, collateral and margin policies and trading authorities; the TMRC meets regularly to monitor the management of our trading market risk activities;\n•\nBOC provides oversight and governance over Basel related regulatory requirements, assesses compliance with respect to Basel regulations and approves all material methodologies and changes, policies and reporting;\n•\nThe Recovery and Resolution Planning Executive Review Board oversees the development of recovery and resolution plans as required by banking regulators;\n•\nMRC monitors the overall level of model risk and provides oversight of the model governance process pertaining to financial models, including the validation of key models and the ongoing monitoring of model performance. The MRC may also, as appropriate, mandate remedial actions and compensating controls to be applied to models to address modeling deficiencies as well as other issues identified;\n•\nThe CCAR Steering Committee provides primary supervision of the stress tests performed in conformity with the Federal Reserve's CCAR process and the Dodd-Frank Act, and is responsible for the overall management, review, and approval of\nState Street Corporation | 88\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nall material assumptions, methodologies, and results of each stress scenario;\n•\nThe State Street Global Advisors Risk Committee is the most senior oversight and decision making committee for risk management within State Street Global Advisors; the committee is responsible for overseeing the alignment of State Street Global Advisors' strategy, and risk appetite, as well as alignment with our corporate-wide strategies and risk management standards; and\n•\nThe Country Risk Committee oversees the identification, assessment, monitoring, reporting and mitigation, where necessary, of country risks.\n•\nThe Regulatory Reporting Oversight Committee is responsible for providing oversight of regulatory reporting and related report governance processes and accountabilities\n.\nBusiness Conduct Committee\n•\nThe Fiduciary Review Committee reviews and assesses the fiduciary risk management programs of those units in which we serve in a fiduciary capacity;\n•\nThe New Business and Product Approval Committee provides oversight of the evaluation of the risk inherent in proposed new products or services and new business, and extensions of existing products or services, evaluations including economic justification, material risk, compliance, regulatory and legal considerations, and capital and liquidity analyses;\n•\nThe Compliance and Ethics Committee provides review and oversight of our compliance programs, including our culture of compliance and high standards of ethical behavior;\n•\nThe Legal Entity Oversight Committee establishes standards with respect to the governance of our legal entities, monitors adherence to those standards, and oversees the ongoing evaluation of our legal entity structure, including the formation, maintenance and dissolution of legal entities; and\n•\nThe Conduct Standards Committee provides oversight of our enforcement of employee conduct standards.\nTechnology and Operational Risk Committee\n•\nThe Operational Risk Committee, along with the support of regional business or entity-specific working groups and\ncommittees, is responsible for oversight of our operational risk programs, including determining that the implementation of those programs is designed to identify, manage and control operational risk in an effective and consistent manner across the firm;\n•\nThe Technology Risk Committee is responsible for the global oversight, review and monitoring of operational, legal and regulatory compliance and reputational risk that may result in a significant change to our Information Technology risk profile or a material financial loss or reputational impact to global technology services. The Committee serves as a forum to provide regular reporting to TORC and escalate technology risk and control issues to TORC, as appropriate; and\n•\nThe Executive Information Security Committee provides direction for the Enterprise Information Security posture and program, including cyber-security protections, provides enterprise-wide oversight and assessment of the effectiveness of all Information Security Programs to promote that controls are measured and managed, and serves as an escalation point for cyber-security issues.\n•\nThe Enterprise Continuity Steering Committee considers matters pertaining to continuity and related risks, including oversight in determining the direction of the continuity program.\n•\nThe Vendor Management Lifecycle Executive Review Board oversees the end-to-end vendor management process to support operations in an efficient and sustainable manner, to oversee management of vendor-related risks, and to support compliance with regulatory standards.\nCredit Risk Management\nCore Policies and Principles\nWe define credit risk as the risk of financial loss if a counterparty, borrower or obligor, collectively referred to as a counterparty, is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual terms. We assume credit risk in our traditional non-trading lending activities, such as overdrafts, loans and contingent commitments, in our investment securities portfolio, where recourse to a counterparty exists, and in our direct and indirect trading activities, such as securities purchased under a resale agreement, principal securities lending and foreign exchange and indemnified agency securities lending. We also assume credit risk in our day-to-day treasury and securities\nand other settlement operations, in the form\nState Street Corporation | 89\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nof deposit placements and other cash balances, with central banks or private sector institutions and fees receivables.\nWe distinguish between three major types of credit risk:\n•\nDefault risk - the risk that a counterparty fails to meet its contractual payment obligations;\n•\nCountry risk - the risk that we may suffer a loss, in any given country, due to any of the following reasons: deterioration of economic conditions, political and social upheaval, nationalization and appropriation of assets, government repudiation of indebtedness, exchange controls and disruptive currency depreciation or devaluation; and\n•\nSettlement risk - the risk that the settlement or clearance of transactions will fail, which arises whenever the exchange of cash, securities and/or other assets is not simultaneous.\nThe acceptance of credit risk by us is governed by corporate policies and guidelines, which include standardized procedures applied across the entire organization. These policies and guidelines include specific requirements related to each counterparty's risk profile; the markets served; counterparty, industry and country concentrations; and regulatory compliance. These policies and procedures also implement a number of core principles, which include the following:\n•\nWe measure and consolidate credit risks to each counterparty, or group of counterparties, in accordance with a “one-obligor” principle that aggregates risks across our business units;\n•\nERM reviews and approves all extensions of credit, or material changes to extensions of credit (such as changes in term, collateral structure or covenants), in accordance with assigned credit-approval authorities;\n•\nCredit-approval authorities are assigned to individuals according to their qualifications, experience and training, and these authorities are periodically reviewed. Our largest exposures require approval by the Credit Committee, a sub-committee of the CRPC. With respect to small and low-risk extensions of credit to certain types of counterparties, approval authority is granted to individuals outside of ERM;\n•\nWe seek to avoid or limit undue concentrations of risk. Counterparty (or\ngroups of counterparties), industry, country and product-specific concentrations of risk are subject to frequent review and approval in accordance with our risk appetite;\n•\nWe determine the creditworthiness of counterparties through a detailed risk assessment, including the use of internal risk-rating methodologies;\n•\nWe review all extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of counterparties at least annually. The nature and extent of these reviews are determined by the size, nature and term of the extensions of credit and the creditworthiness of the counterparty; and\n•\nWe subject all corporate policies and guidelines to annual review as an integral part of our periodic assessment of our risk appetite.\nOur corporate policies and guidelines require that the business units which engage in activities that give rise to credit and counterparty risk comply with procedures that promote the extension of credit for legitimate business purposes; are consistent with the maintenance of proper credit standards; limit credit-related losses; and are consistent with our goal of maintaining a strong financial condition.\nStructure and Organization\nThe Credit and Global Markets Risk group within ERM is responsible for the assessment, approval and monitoring of credit risk across our business. The group is managed centrally, has dedicated teams in a number of locations worldwide across our businesses, and is responsible for related policies and procedures, and for our internal credit-rating systems and methodologies. In addition, the group, in conjunction with the business units, establishes measurements and limits to control the amount of credit risk accepted across its various business activities, both at the portfolio level and for each individual counterparty or group of counterparties, to individual industries, and also to counterparties by product and country of risk. These measurements and limits are reviewed periodically, but at least annually.\nIn conjunction with other groups in ERM, the Credit and Global Markets Risk group is jointly responsible for the design, implementation and oversight of our credit risk measurement and management systems, including data and assessment systems, quantification systems and the reporting framework.\nVarious key committees within our company are responsible for the oversight of credit risk and associated credit risk policies, systems and models.\nState Street Corporation | 90\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAll credit-related activities are governed by our risk appetite framework and our credit risk guidelines, which define our general philosophy with respect to credit risk and the manner in which we control, manage and monitor such risks.\nThe previously described CRPC (refer to \"Risk Committees\") has primary responsibility for the oversight, review and approval of the credit risk guidelines and policies. Credit risk guidelines and policies are reviewed periodically, but at least annually.\nThe Credit Committee, a sub-committee of the CRPC, has responsibility for assigning credit authority and approving the largest and higher-risk extensions of credit to individual counterparties or groups of counterparties.\nCRPC provides periodic updates to MRAC and the Board's RC.\nCredit Ratings\nWe perform initial and ongoing reviews to exercise due diligence on the creditworthiness of our counterparties when conducting any business with them or approving any credit limits.\nThis due diligence process generally includes the assignment of an internal credit rating, which is determined by the use of internally developed and validated methodologies, scorecards and a 15-grade rating scale. This risk-rating process incorporates the use of risk-rating tools in conjunction with management judgment; qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a replicable manner and, following a formal review and approval process, an internal credit rating based on our rating scale is assigned. Credit ratings are reviewed and approved by the Credit and Global Markets Risk group or designees within ERM. To facilitate comparability across the portfolio, counterparties within a given sector are rated using a risk-rating tool developed for that sector.\nOur risk-rating methodologies are approved by the CRPC, after completion of internal model validation processes, and are subject to an annual review, including re-validation.\nWe generally rate our counterparties individually, although accounts defined by us as low-risk are rated on a pooled basis. We evaluate and rate the credit risk of our counterparties on an ongoing basis.\nRisk Parameter Estimates\nOur internal risk-rating system promotes a clear and consistent approach to the determination of appropriate credit risk classifications for our credit counterparties and exposures, tracking the changes in risk associated with these counterparties and exposures over time. This capability enhances our ability to more accurately calculate both risk\nexposures and capital, enabling better strategic decision making across the organization.\nWe use credit risk parameter estimates for the following purposes:\n•\nThe assessment of the creditworthiness of new counterparties and, in conjunction with our risk appetite statement, the development of appropriate credit limits for our products and services, including loans, foreign exchange, securities finance, placements and repurchase agreements;\n•\nThe use of an automated process for limit approvals for certain low-risk counterparties, as defined in our credit risk guidelines, based on the counterparty’s probability-of-default, or PD, rating class;\n•\nThe development of approval authority matrices based on PD; riskier counterparties with higher PDs require higher levels of approval for a comparable PD and limit size compared to less risky counterparties with lower PDs;\n•\nThe analysis of risk concentration trends using historical PD and exposure-at-default, or EAD, data;\n•\nThe standardization of rating integrity testing by GCR using rating parameters;\n•\nThe determination of the level of management review of short-duration advances depending on PD; riskier counterparties with higher rating class values generally trigger higher levels of management escalation for comparable short-duration advances compared to less risky counterparties with lower rating-class values;\n•\nThe monitoring of credit facility utilization levels using EAD values and the identification of instances where counterparties have exceeded limits;\n•\nThe aggregation and comparison of counterparty exposures with risk appetite levels to determine if businesses are maintaining appropriate risk levels; and\n•\nThe determination of our regulatory capital requirements for the AIRB provided in the Basel framework.\nCredit Risk Mitigation\nWe seek to limit our credit exposure and reduce  any potential credit losses through the use of various types of credit risk mitigation. The Basel III final rule permits us to reflect the application of credit risk mitigation when it meets the standards outlined\nState Street Corporation | 91\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\ntherein. Examples of forms of credit risk mitigation include collateral, netting, guarantees and secured interest in non-financial assets. Where possible, we apply the recognition of collateral, guarantees and secured interest over non-financial assets to mitigate overall risk within our counterparty credit portfolio. While credit default swaps are permitted under the Basel III final rule, we do not actively use credit default swaps as a risk mitigation tool.\nCollateral\nIn many parts of our business, we regularly require or agree for collateral to be received from or provided to clients and counterparties in connection with contracts that incur credit risk. In our trading businesses, this collateral is typically in the form of cash, as well as highly-rated and/or liquid securities (i.e. government securities and other bonds or equity securities). Credit risks in our non-trading and securities finance businesses are also often secured by bonds and equity securities and by other types of assets. Collateral serves to reduce the risk of loss inherent in an exposure by improving the prospect of recovery in the event of a counterparty default. However, rapidly changing market values of the collateral we hold, unexpected increases in the credit exposure to a client or counterparty, reductions in the value or change in the type of securities held by us, as well as operational errors or errors in the manner in which we seek to exercise our rights, may reduce the risk mitigation effects of collateral or result in other security interests not being effective to reduce potential credit exposure. While collateral is often an alternative source of repayment, it does not replace the requirement within our policies and guidelines for high-quality underwriting standards. We also may choose to incur credit exposure without the benefit of collateral or other risk mitigating credits rights.\nOur credit risk guidelines require that the collateral we accept for risk mitigation purposes is of high quality, can be reliably valued and is supported by a valid security interest that permits liquidation if or when required. Generally, when collateral is of lower quality, more difficult to value or more challenging to liquidate, higher discounts to market values are applied for the purposes of measuring credit risk. For certain less liquid collateral, longer liquidation periods are assumed when determining the credit exposure.\nAll types of collateral are assessed regularly by ERM, as is the basis on which the collateral is valued. Our assessment of collateral, including the ability to liquidate collateral in the event of a counterparty default, and also with regard to market values of collateral under a variety of hypothetical market conditions, is an integral component of our assessment of risk and approval of credit limits. We also seek to identify, limit and monitor instances of\n\"wrong-way\" risk, where a counterparty’s risk of default is positively correlated with the risk of our collateral eroding in value.\nWe maintain policies and procedures requiring that documentation used to collateralize a transaction is legal, valid, binding and enforceable in the relevant jurisdictions. We also conduct legal reviews to assess whether our documentation meets these standards on an ongoing basis.\nNetting\nNetting is a mechanism that allows institutions and counterparties to net offsetting exposures and payment obligations against one another through the use of qualifying master netting agreements. A master netting agreement allows for certain rights and remedies upon a counterparty default, including the right to net obligations arising under derivatives or other transactions under such agreement. In such an event, the netting of obligations would result in a single net claim owed by, or to, the counterparty. This is commonly referred to as \"close-out netting,” and is pursued wherever possible. We may also enter into master agreements that allow for the netting of amounts payable on a given day and in the same currency, reducing our settlement risk. This is commonly referred to as “payment netting,” and is widely used in our foreign exchange activities.\nAs with collateral, we have policies and procedures in place to apply close-out and payment netting only to the extent that we have verified legal validity and enforceability of the master agreement. In the case of payment netting, operational constraints may preclude us from reducing settlement risk, notwithstanding the legal right to require the same under the master netting agreement. In the event we become unable, due to operational constraints, actions by regulators, changes in accounting principles, law or regulation (or related interpretations) or other factors, to net some or all of our offsetting exposures and payment obligations under those agreements, we would be required to gross up our assets and liabilities on our statement of condition and our calculation of RWA, accordingly.  This would result in a potentially material change in our regulatory ratios, including LCR, and present increased credit, liquidity, asset-and-liability management and operational risks, some of which could be material.\nGuarantees\nA guarantee is a financial instrument that results in credit support being provided by a third party, (i.e., the protection provider) to the underlying obligor (the beneficiary of the provided protection) on account of an exposure owing by the obligor. The protection provider may support the underlying exposure either in whole or in part. Support of this kind may take different forms. Typical forms of guarantees provided\nState Street Corporation | 92\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nto us include financial guarantees, letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, purchase undertaking agreement contracts and insurance.\nWe have established a review process to evaluate guarantees under the applicable requirements of our policies and Basel III requirements. Governance for this evaluation is covered under policies and procedures that require regular reviews of documentation, jurisdictions and credit quality of protection providers.\nCredit Limits\nCentral to our philosophy for our management of credit risk is the approval and imposition of credit limits, against which we monitor the actual and potential future credit exposure arising from our business activities with counterparties or groups of counterparties. Credit limits are a reflection of our risk appetite, which may be determined by the creditworthiness of the counterparty, the nature of the risk inherent in the business undertaken with the counterparty, or a combination of relevant credit factors. Our risk appetite for certain sectors and certain countries and geographic regions may also influence the level of risk we are willing to assume to certain counterparties.\nThe analysis and approval of credit limits is undertaken in a consistent manner across our businesses, although the nature and extent of the analysis may vary, based on the type, term and magnitude of the risk being assumed. Credit limits and underlying exposures are assessed and measured on both a gross and net basis where appropriate, with net exposure determined by deducting the value of any collateral held. For certain types of risk being assumed, we will also assess and measure exposures under a variety of hypothetical market conditions. Credit limit approvals across our business are undertaken by the Credit and Global Markets Risk group, by individuals to whom credit authority has been delegated, or by the Credit Committee.\nCredit limits are re-evaluated annually, or more frequently as needed, and are revised periodically on prevailing and anticipated market conditions, changes in counterparty or country-specific credit ratings and outlook, changes in our risk appetite for certain counterparties, sectors or countries, and enhancements to the measurement of credit utilization.\nReporting\nOngoing active monitoring and management of our credit risk is an integral part of our credit risk management framework. We maintain management information systems to identify, measure, monitor and report credit risk across businesses and legal entities, enabling ERM and our businesses to have timely\naccess to accurate information on credit limits and exposures. Monitoring is performed along the dimensions of counterparty, industry, country and product-specific risks to facilitate the identification of concentrations of risk and emerging trends.\nKey aspects of this credit risk reporting structure include governance and oversight groups, policies that define standards for the reporting of credit risk, data aggregation and sourcing systems and separate testing of relevant risk reporting functions by Corporate Audit.\nThe Credit Portfolio Management group routinely assesses the composition of our overall credit risk portfolio for alignment with our stated risk appetite. This assessment includes routine analysis and reporting of the portfolio, monitoring of market-based indicators, the assessment of industry trends and developments and regular reviews of concentrated risks. The Credit Portfolio Management group is also responsible, in conjunction with the business units, for defining the appetite for credit risk in the major sectors in which we have a concentration of business activities. These sector-level risk appetite statements, which include counterparty selection criteria and granular underwriting guidelines, are reviewed periodically and approved by the CRPC.\nMonitoring\nRegular surveillance of credit and counterparty risks is undertaken by our business units, the Credit and Global Markets Risk group and designees with ERM, allowing for frequent and extensive oversight. This surveillance process includes, but is not limited to, the following components:\n•\nAnnual Reviews\n.\nA formal review of counterparties is conducted at least annually and includes a thorough review of operating performance, primary risk factors and our internal credit risk rating. This annual review also includes a review of current and proposed credit limits, an assessment of our ongoing risk appetite and verification that supporting legal documentation remains effective.\n•\nInterim Monitoring.\nMonitoring of our largest and riskiest counterparties is undertaken more frequently, utilizing financial information, market indicators and other relevant credit and performance measures. The nature and extent of this interim monitoring is individually tailored to certain counterparties and/or industry sectors to identify material changes to the risk profile of a counterparty (or group of counterparties) and assign an updated internal risk rating in a timely manner.\nState Street Corporation | 93\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe maintain an active \"watch list\" for all counterparties where we have identified a concern that the actual or potential risk of default has increased. The watch list status denotes a concern with some aspect of a counterparty's risk profile that warrants closer monitoring of the counterparty's financial performance and related risk factors. Our ongoing monitoring processes are designed to facilitate the early identification of counterparties whose creditworthiness is deteriorating; any counterparty may be placed on the watch list by ERM at its sole discretion.\nCounterparties that receive an internal risk rating within a certain range on our rating scale are eligible for watch list designation. These risk ratings generally correspond with the non-investment grade or near non-investment grade ratings established by the major independent credit-rating agencies, and also include the regulatory classifications of “Special Mention,” “Substandard,” “Doubtful” and “Loss.” Counterparties whose internal ratings are outside this range may also be placed on the watch list.\nThe Credit and Global Markets Risk group maintains primary responsibility for our watch list processes, and generates a monthly report of all watch list counterparties. The watch list is formally reviewed at least on a quarterly basis, with participation from senior ERM staff, and representatives from the business units and our corporate finance and legal groups as appropriate. These meetings include a review of individual watch list counterparties, together with credit limits and prevailing exposures, and are focused on actions to contain, reduce or eliminate the risk of loss to us. Identified actions are documented and monitored.\nControls\nGCR provides a separate level of surveillance and oversight over the integrity of our credit risk management processes, including the internal risk-rating system. GCR reviews counterparty credit ratings for all identified sectors on an ongoing basis. GCR is subject to oversight by the CRPC, and provides periodic updates to the Board’s RC.\nSpecific activities of GCR include the following:\n•\nPerform separate and objective assessments of our credit and counterparty exposures to determine the nature and extent of risk undertaken by the business units;\n•\nExecute periodic credit process and credit product reviews to assess the quality of credit analysis, compliance with policies, guidelines and relevant regulation, transaction structures and underwriting standards, and risk-rating integrity;\n•\nIdentify and monitor developing counterparty, market and/or industry sector trends to limit risk of loss and protect capital;\n•\nDeliver regular and formal reporting to stakeholders, including exam results, identified issues and the status of requisite actions to remedy identified deficiencies;\n•\nAllocate resources for specialized risk assessments (on an as-needed basis); and\n•\nLiaise with assurance partners and regulatory personnel on matters relating to risk rating, reporting and measurement.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses to support our financial assets held at amortized cost.  We also maintain an allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit to support our off-balance credit exposure. The two components together represent the allowance for credit losses. Review and evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is ongoing throughout the year, but occurs at least quarterly, and is based, among other factors, on our evaluation of the level of risk in the portfolio and the estimated effects of our forecasts on our counterparties. We utilize multiple economic scenarios, consisting of a baseline, upside and downside scenarios, to develop management's forecast of future expected losses.\nThe economic forecast utilized throughout 2020 reflects both downward credit migration within our loan portfolio and revision in management’s economic outlook reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Allowance estimates remain subject to continued model and economic uncertainty and management may use qualitative adjustments. If future data and forecasts deviate relative to the forecasts utilized to determine our allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020, or if credit risk migration is higher or lower than forecasted for reasons independent of the economic forecast, our allowance for credit losses will also change.\nAdditional information about the allowance for credit losses is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nOur liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk based on our activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors.  In managing liquidity risk we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning indicators and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs.  This process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in\nState Street Corporation | 94\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\navailable sources of cash, as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets.\nWe manage our liquidity on a global, consolidated basis. We also manage liquidity on a stand-alone basis at our Parent Company, as well as at certain branches and subsidiaries of State Street Bank. State Street Bank generally has access to markets and funding sources limited to banks, such as the federal funds market and the Federal Reserve's discount window. The Parent Company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile, reflecting narrower market access. Additionally, the Parent Company typically holds, or has direct access to, primarily through SSIF (a direct subsidiary of the Parent Company), as discussed in \"Supervision and Regulation\" in Business in this Form 10-K, enough cash to meet its current debt maturities and cash needs, as well as those projected over the next one-year period. Absent financial distress at the Parent Company, the liquid assets available at SSIF continue to be available to the Parent Company. As of December 31, 2020, the value of our Parent Company's net liquid assets totaled $492 million, compared with $428 million as of December 31, 2019, which amount does not include available liquidity through SSIF. As of December 31, 2020, our Parent Company and State Street Bank had approximately $1.50 billion of senior notes or subordinated debentures outstanding that will mature in the next twelve months.\nAs a SIFI, our liquidity risk management activities are subject to heightened and evolving regulatory requirements, including interpretations of those requirements, under specific U.S. and international regulations and also resulting from published and unpublished guidance, supervisory activities, such as stress tests, resolution planning, examinations and other regulatory interactions.  Satisfaction of these requirements could, in some cases, result in changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, reduced NII or NIM, a reduction in the level of certain business activities or modifications to the way in which we deliver our products and services.  If we fail to meet regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of our regulators, we could receive negative regulatory stress test results, incur a resolution plan deficiency or determination of a non-credible resolution plan or otherwise receive an adverse regulatory finding.  Our efforts to satisfy, or our failure to satisfy, these regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGovernance\nGlobal Treasury is responsible for our management of liquidity. This includes the day-to-day\nmanagement of our global liquidity position, the development and monitoring of early warning indicators, key liquidity risk metrics, the creation and execution of stress tests, the evaluation and implementation of regulatory requirements, the maintenance and execution of our liquidity guidelines and contingency funding plan (CFP), and routine management reporting to ALCO, MRAC and the Board's RC.\nGlobal Treasury Risk Management, part of ERM, provides separate oversight over the identification, communication and management of Global Treasury’s risks in support of our business strategy. Global Treasury Risk Management reports to the CRO. Global Treasury Risk Management’s responsibilities relative to liquidity risk management include the development and review of policies and guidelines; the monitoring of limits related to adherence to the liquidity risk guidelines and associated reporting.\nLiquidity Framework\nOur liquidity framework contemplates areas of potential risk based on our activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors. In managing liquidity risk we employ limits, maintain established metrics and early warning indicators, and perform routine stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs. This process involves the evaluation of a combination of internal and external scenarios which assist us in measuring our liquidity position and in identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash, as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets.\nWe manage liquidity according to several principles that are equally important to our overall liquidity risk management framework:\n•\nStructural liquidity management addresses liquidity by monitoring and directing the composition of our consolidated statement of condition. Structural liquidity is measured by metrics such as the percentage of total wholesale funds to consolidated total assets, and the percentage of non-government investment securities to client deposits. In addition, on a regular basis and as described below, our structural liquidity is evaluated under various stress scenarios.\n•\nTactical liquidity management addresses our day-to-day funding requirements and is largely driven by changes in our primary source of funding, which are client deposits. Fluctuations in client deposits may be supplemented with short-term borrowings, repurchase\nState Street Corporation | 95\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nagreements, FHLB products and certificates of deposit.\n•\nStress testing and contingent funding planning are longer-term strategic liquidity risk management practices. Regular and ad hoc liquidity stress testing are performed under various severe but plausible scenarios at the consolidated level and at significant subsidiaries, including State Street Bank. These tests contemplate severe market and events specific to us under various time horizons and severities. Tests contemplate the impact of material changes in key funding sources, credit ratings, additional collateral requirements, contingent uses of funding, systemic shocks to the financial markets and operational failures based on market and assumptions specific to us. The stress tests evaluate the required level of funding versus available sources in an adverse environment. As stress testing contemplates potential forward-looking scenarios, results also serve as a trigger to activate specific liquidity stress levels and contingent funding actions.\nCFPs are designed to assist senior management with decision-making associated with any contingency funding response to a possible or actual crisis scenario. The CFPs define roles, responsibilities and management actions to be taken in the event of deterioration of our liquidity profile caused by either an event specific to us or a broader disruption in the capital markets. Specific actions are linked to the level of stress indicated by these measures or by management judgment of market conditions.\nLiquidity Risk Metrics\nIn managing our liquidity, we employ early warning indicators and metrics. Early warning indicators are intended to detect situations which may result in a liquidity stress, including changes in our common stock price and the spread on our long-term debt. Additional metrics that are critical to the management of our consolidated statement of condition and monitored as part of our routine liquidity management include measures of our fungible cash position, purchased wholesale funds, unencumbered liquid assets, deposits and the total of investment securities and loans as a percentage of total client deposits.\nAsset Liquidity\nCentral to the management of our liquidity is asset liquidity, which consists primarily of HQLA. HQLA is the amount of liquid assets that qualify for inclusion in the LCR. As a banking organization, we are subject to a minimum LCR under the LCR rule approved by U.S. banking regulators. The LCR is\nintended to promote the short-term resilience of internationally active banking organizations, like us, to improve the banking industry's ability to absorb shocks arising from market stress over a 30 calendar day period and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk. The LCR measures an institution’s HQLA against its net cash outflows. HQLA primarily consists of unencumbered cash and certain high quality liquid securities that qualify for inclusion under the LCR rule. The LCR was fully implemented beginning on January 1, 2017. We report LCR to the Federal Reserve daily. For the quarters ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, daily average LCR for the Parent Company was 108% and 110%, respectively. The average HQLA for the Parent Company under the LCR final rule definition was $143.61 billion and $100.23 billion, post-prescribed haircuts, for the quarters ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase in average HQLA for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2019, was primarily a result of the increase in MBS and supranational purchases.\nWe maintained average cash balances in excess of regulatory requirements governing deposits with the Federal Reserve of approximately $75.68 billion at the Federal Reserve, the ECB and other non-U.S. central banks for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, and $41.56 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2019. The higher levels of average cash balances with central banks reflect higher levels of client deposits.\nLiquid securities carried in our asset liquidity include securities pledged without corresponding advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (FRBB), the FHLB, and other non-U.S. central banks. State Street Bank is a member of the FHLB. This membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against high-quality collateral, which helps facilitate asset-and-liability management. As of  December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings from the FHLB.\nAccess to primary, intra-day and contingent liquidity provided by these utilities is an important source of contingent liquidity with utilization subject to underlying conditions.  As of  December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the FRBB discount window or any other central bank facility.\nIn addition to the securities included in our asset liquidity, we have significant amounts of other unencumbered investment securities. These securities are available sources of liquidity, although not as rapidly deployed as those included in our asset liquidity.\nState Street Corporation | 96\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe average fair value of total unencumbered securities was $89.12 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2020, compared to $76.94 billion for the quarter ended December 31, 2019.\nMeasures of liquidity include LCR and NSFR, which are described in \"Supervision and Regulation\" in Business in this Form 10-K.\nUses of Liquidity\nSignificant uses of our liquidity could result from the following: withdrawals of client deposits; draw-downs by our custody clients of lines of credit; advances to clients to settle securities transactions; increases in our investment and loan portfolios; or other permitted purposes. Such circumstances would generally arise under stress conditions including deterioration in credit ratings. A recurring use of our liquidity involves our deployment of HQLA from our investment portfolio to post collateral to financial institutions serving as sources of securities under our enhanced custody program.\nWe had unfunded commitments to extend credit with gross contractual amounts totaling $34.21 billion and $29.70 billion and standby letters of credit totaling $3.33 billion and $3.32 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.  These amounts do not reflect the value of any collateral. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 73% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit and 20% of our standby letters of credit expire within one year. Since many of our commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.\nInformation about our resolution planning and the impact actions under our resolution plans could have on our liquidity is provided in \"Supervision and Regulation\" in Business in this Form 10-K.\nFunding\nDeposits\nWe provide products and services including custody, accounting, administration, daily pricing, FX services, cash management, financial asset management, securities finance and investment advisory services. As a provider of these products and services, we generate client deposits, which have generally provided a stable, low-cost source of funds. As a global custodian, clients place deposits with our entities in various currencies. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 65% of our average total deposit balances were denominated in U.S. dollars, approximately 15% in EUR, 10% in GBP and 10% in all other currencies. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 60% of our average total deposit balances were denominated in U.S. dollars,\napproximately 20% in EUR, 10% in GBP and 10% in all other currencies.\nShort-Term Funding\nOur on-balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy. These assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets, but more importantly, they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales. In addition, our access to the global capital markets gives us the ability to source incremental funding from wholesale investors. As discussed earlier under “Asset Liquidity,” State Street Bank's membership in the FHLB allows for advances of liquidity with varying terms against high-quality collateral.\nShort-term secured funding also comes in the form of securities lent or sold under agreements to repurchase. These transactions are short-term in nature, generally overnight and are collateralized by high-quality investment securities. These balances were $3.41 billion and $1.10 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nState Street Bank currently maintains a line of credit with a financial institution of CAD $1.40 billion, or approximately $1.10 billion, as of December 31, 2020, to support its Canadian securities processing operations. The line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice. As of both December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there was no balance outstanding on this line of credit.\nLong-Term Funding\nWe have the ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration statement to meet current commitments and business needs, including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of our clients. The total amount remaining for issuance under the registration statement is $7 billion as of December 31, 2020. In addition, State Street Bank also has current authorization from the Board to issue up to $5 billion in unsecured senior debt.\nOn January 24, 2020, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.400% Senior Notes due 2030 in a public offering.\nOn March 26, 2020, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.825% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2023, $500 million aggregate principal amount of 2.901% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2026 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.152% of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2031.\nState Street Corporation | 97\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAgency Credit Ratings\nOur ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies. Factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include:\n•\ndiverse and stable core earnings;\n•\nrelative market position;\n•\nstrong risk management;\n•\nstrong capital ratios;\n•\ndiverse liquidity sources, including the global capital markets and client deposits;\n•\nstrong liquidity monitoring procedures; and\n•\npreparedness for current or future regulatory developments.\nHigh ratings limit borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by:\n•\nproviding assurance for unsecured funding and depositors;\n•\nincreasing the potential market for our debt and improving our ability to offer products;\n•\nserving markets; and\n•\nengaging in transactions in which clients value high credit ratings.\nA downgrade or reduction of our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by restricting our ability to access the capital markets, which could increase the related cost of funds. In turn, this could cause the sudden and large-scale withdrawal of unsecured deposits by our clients, which could lead to draw-downs of unfunded commitments to extend credit or trigger requirements under securities purchase commitments; or require additional collateral or force terminations of certain trading derivative contracts.\nA majority of our derivative contracts have been entered into under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. We assess the impact of these arrangements by determining the collateral that would be required assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies. The additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under these arrangements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings below levels specified in the agreements is provided in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.\nState Street Corporation | 98\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nContractual Cash Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe long-term contractual cash obligations included within Table 32: Long-Term Contractual Cash Obligations were recorded in our consolidated statement of condition as of December 31, 2020, except for the interest portions of long-term debt and finance leases.\n(1)\nLong-term debt excludes finance lease obligations (presented as a separate line item) and the effect of interest rate swaps. Interest payments were calculated at the stated rate with the exception of floating-rate debt, for which payments were calculated using the indexed rate in effect as of December 31, 2020.\n(2)\nAdditional information about contractual cash obligations related to long-term debt and operating and finance leases is provided in Notes 9 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nTotal contractual cash obligations shown in Table 32: Long-Term Contractual Cash Obligations do not include:\n•\nObligations which will be settled in cash, primarily in less than one year, such as client deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and other short-term borrowings. Additional information about deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and other short-term borrowings is provided in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\n•\nObligations related to derivative instruments because the derivative-related amounts recorded in our consolidated statement of condition as of  December 31, 2020 did not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under the contracts upon settlement. Additional information about our derivative instruments is provided in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. We have obligations under pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, with additional information provided in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K, which are not included in Table 32: Long-Term Contractual Cash Obligations.\n(1)\nTotal amounts committed reflect participations to independent third parties, if any.\n(2)\nAmounts represent obligations pursuant to legally binding agreements, where we have agreed to purchase products or services with a specific minimum quantity defined at a fixed, minimum or variable price over a specified period of time.\nAdditional information about the commitments presented in Table 33: Other commercial commitments, except for purchase obligations, is provided in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nState Street Corporation | 99\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOperational Risk Management\nOverview\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk encompasses fiduciary risk and legal risk. Fiduciary risk is defined as the risk that we fail to properly exercise our fiduciary duties in our provision of products or services to clients. Legal risk is the risk of loss resulting from failure to comply with laws and contractual obligations.\nOperational risk is inherent in the performance of investment servicing and investment management activities on behalf of our clients. Whether it be fiduciary risk, risk associated with execution and processing or other types of operational risk, a consistent, transparent and effective operational risk framework is key to identifying, monitoring and managing operational risk.\nWe have established an operational risk framework that is based on three major goals:\n•\nStrong, active governance;\n•\nOwnership and accountability; and\n•\nConsistency and transparency.\nGovernance\nOur Board is responsible for the approval and oversight of our overall operational risk framework. It does so through its TOPS, which reviews our operational risk framework and approves our operational risk policy annually.\nOur operational risk policy establishes our approach to our management of operational risk across our business. The policy identifies the responsibilities of individuals and committees charged with oversight of the management of operational risk, and articulates a broad mandate that supports implementation of the operational risk framework.\nERM and other control groups provide the oversight, validation and verification of the management and measurement of operational risk.\nExecutive management actively manages and oversees our operational risk framework through membership on various risk management committees, including MRAC, the BCC, TORC, the Operational Risk Committee, the Executive Information Security Steering Committee, the Enterprise Continuity Steering Committee, the Compliance and Ethics Committee, the Vendor Management Lifecycle Executive Review Board and the Fiduciary Review Committee, all of which ultimately report to the appropriate committee of the Board.\nThe Operational Risk Committee, chaired by the global head of Operational Risk and co-chaired by the FLOD Head of Business Risk Management, provides cross-business oversight of operational risk, operational risk programs and their implementation to identify, measure, manage and control operational risk in an effective and consistent manner and reviews and approves operational risk guidelines intended to maintain a consistent implementation of our corporate operational risk policy and framework.\nOwnership and Accountability\nWe have implemented our operational risk framework to support the broad mandate established by our operational risk policy. This framework represents an integrated set of processes and tools that assists us in the management and measurement of operational risk, including our calculation of required capital and RWA.\nThe framework takes a comprehensive view and integrates the methods and tools used to manage and measure operational risk. The framework utilizes aspects of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) framework and other industry leading practices, and is designed foremost to address our risk management needs while complying with regulatory requirements. The operational risk framework is intended to provide a number of important benefits, including:\n•\nA common understanding of operational risk management and its supporting processes;\n•\nThe clarification of responsibilities for the management of operational risk across our business;\n•\nThe alignment of business priorities with risk management objectives;\n•\nThe active management of risk and early identification of emerging risks;\n•\nThe consistent application of policies and the collection of data for risk management and measurement; and\n•\nThe estimation of our operational risk capital requirement.\nThe operational risk framework employs a distributed risk management infrastructure executed by ERM groups aligned with the business units, which are responsible for the implementation of the operational risk framework at the business unit level.\nAs with other risks, senior business unit management is responsible for the day-to-day operational risk management of their respective businesses. It is business unit management's responsibility to provide oversight of the\nState Street Corporation | 100\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nimplementation and ongoing execution of the operational risk framework within their respective organizations, as well as coordination and communication with ERM.\nConsistency and Transparency\nA number of corporate control functions are directly responsible for implementing and assessing various aspects of our operational risk framework, with the overarching goal of consistency and transparency to meet the evolving needs of the business:\n•\nThe global head of Operational Risk, a member of the CRO’s executive management team, leads ERM’s corporate ORM group. ORM is responsible for the strategy, evolution and consistent implementation of our operational risk guidelines, framework and supporting tools across our business. ORM reviews and analyzes operational key risk information, events, metrics and indicators at the business unit and corporate level for purposes of risk management, reporting and escalation to the CRO, senior management and governance committees;\n•\nERM’s Centralized Modeling and Analytics group develops and maintains operational risk capital estimation models, and ORM's Capital Analysis group calculates our required capital for operational risk;\n•\nERM’s MVG independently validates the quantitative models used to measure operational risk, and ORM performs validation checks on the output of the model;\n•\nCIS establishes the framework, policies and related programs to measure, monitor and report on information security risks, including the effectiveness of cyber-security program protections. CIS defines and manages the enterprise-wide information security program. CIS coordinates with Information Technology, control functions and business units to support the confidentiality, integrity and availability of corporate information assets. CIS identifies and employs a risk-based methodology consistent with applicable regulatory cyber-security requirements and monitors the compliance of our systems with information security policies; and\n•\nCorporate Audit performs separate reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies utilized across our business.\nOur operational risk framework consists of five components, each described below, which provide a\nworking structure that integrates distinct risk programs into a continuous process focused on managing and measuring operational risk in a coordinated and consistent manner.\nRisk Identification and Assessments\nThe objective of risk identification and assessments is to understand business unit strategy, risk profile and potential exposures. It is achieved through a series of risk assessments across our business using techniques for the identification, assessment and measurement of risk across a spectrum of potential frequency and severity combinations. Three primary risk assessment programs, which occur annually, augmented by other business-specific programs, are the core of this component:\n•\nThe risk and control assessment program seeks to understand the risks associated with day-to-day activities, and the effectiveness of controls intended to manage potential exposures arising from these activities. These risks are typically frequent in nature but generally not severe in terms of exposure;\n•\nThe Material Risk Identification process utilizes a bottom-up approach to identify our most significant risk exposures across all on- and off-balance sheet risk-taking activities. The program is specifically designed to consider risks that could have a material impact irrespective of their likelihood or frequency. This can include risks that may have an impact on longer-term business objectives, such as significant change management activities or long-term strategic initiatives;\n•\nThe Scenario Analysis program focuses on the set of risks with the highest severity and most relevance from a capital perspective. These are generally referred to as “tail risks,\" and serve as important benchmarks for our loss distribution approach model (see below); they also provide inputs into stress testing; and\n•\nBusiness-specific programs to identify, assess and measure risk, including new business and product review and approval, new client screening, and, as deemed appropriate, targeted risk assessments.\nCapital Analysis\nThe primary measurement tool used is an internally developed loss distribution approach (LDA) model. We use the LDA model to quantify required operational risk capital, from which we calculate RWA\nState Street Corporation | 101\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nrelated to operational risk. Such required capital and RWA totaled $3.53 billion and $44.15 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020, compared to $3.84 billion and $47.96 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2019; refer to the \"Capital\" section in \"Financial Condition,\" of this Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nThe LDA model incorporates the four required operational risk elements described below:\n•\nInternal loss event data is collected from across our business in conformity with our operating loss policy that establishes the requirements for collecting and reporting individual loss events. We categorize the data into seven Basel-defined event types and further subdivide the data by business unit, as deemed appropriate. Each of these loss events are represented in a UOM which is used to estimate a specific amount of capital required for the types of loss events that fall into each specific category. Some UOMs are measured at the corporate level because they are not “business specific,” such as damage to physical assets, where the cause of an event is not primarily driven by the behavior of a single business unit. Internal losses of $500 or greater are captured, analyzed and included in the modeling approach. Loss event data is collected using a corporate-wide data collection tool, which stores the data in a Loss Event Data Repository (LEDR) to support processes related to analysis, management reporting and the calculation of required capital. Internal loss event data provides our frequency and severity information to our capital calculation process for historical loss events experienced by us. Internal loss event data may be incorporated into our LDA model in a future quarter following the realization of the losses, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes. An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our LDA model and our operational risk RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event, its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular UOM;\n•\nExternal loss event data provides information with respect to loss event severity from other financial institutions to inform our capital estimation process of events in similar\nbusiness units at other banking organizations. This information supplements the data pool available for use in our LDA model. Assessments of the sufficiency of internal data and the relevance of external data are completed before pooling the two data sources for use in our LDA model;\n•\nScenario analysis workshops are conducted across our business to inform management of the less frequent but most severe, or “tail,” risks that the organization faces. The workshops are attended by senior business unit managers, other support and control partners and business-aligned risk management staff. The workshops are designed to capture information about the significant risks and to estimate potential exposures for individual risks should a loss event occur. The results of these workshops are used to make a comparison to our LDA model results to determine that our calculation of required capital considers relevant risk-related information; and\n•\nBusiness environment and internal control factors are gathered as part of our scenario analysis program to inform the scenario analysis workshop participants of internal loss event data and business-relevant metrics, such as risk assessment program results, along with industry loss event data and case studies where appropriate. Business environment and internal control factors are those characteristics of a bank’s internal and external operating environment that bear an exposure to operational risk. The use of this information indirectly influences our calculation of required capital by providing additional relevant data to workshop participants when reviewing specific UOM risks.\nMonitoring, Reporting and Analytics\nThe objective of risk monitoring is to proactively monitor the changing business environment and corresponding operational risk exposure. It is achieved through a series of quantitative and qualitative monitoring tools that are designed to allow us to understand changes in the business environment, internal control factors, risk metrics, risk assessments, exposures and operating effectiveness, as well as details of loss events and progress on risk initiatives implemented to mitigate potential risk exposures.\nOperational risk reporting is intended to provide transparency, thereby enabling management to manage risk, provide oversight and escalate issues in\nState Street Corporation | 102\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\na timely manner. It is designed to allow the business units, executive management, and the Board's control functions and committees to gain insight into activities that may result in risks and potential exposures. Reports are intended to identify business activities that are experiencing processing issues, whether or not they result in actual loss events. Reporting includes results of monitoring activities, internal and external examinations, regulatory reviews and control assessments. These elements combine in a manner designed to provide a view of potential and emerging risks facing us and information that details its progress on managing risks.\nEffectiveness and Testing\nThe objective of effectiveness and testing is to verify that internal controls are designed appropriately, are consistent with corporate and regulatory standards, and are operating effectively. It is achieved through a series of assessments by both internal and external parties, including Corporate Audit, independent registered public accounting firms, business self-assessments and other control function reviews, such as a Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) testing program.\nConsistent with our standard model validation process, the operational risk LDA model is subject to a detailed review, overseen by the MRC. In addition, the model is subject to a rigorous internal governance process. All changes to the model or input parameters, and the deployment of model updates, are reviewed and approved by the Operational Risk Committee, which has oversight responsibility for the model, with technical input from the MRC.\nDocumentation and Guidelines\nDocumentation and guidelines allow for consistency and repeatability of the various processes that support the operational risk framework across our business.\nOperational risk guidelines document our practices and describe the key elements in a business unit's operational risk management program. The purpose of the guidelines is to set forth and define key operational risk terms, provide further detail on our operational risk programs, and detail the business units' responsibilities to identify, assess, measure, monitor and report operational risk. The guideline supports our operational risk policy.\nData standards have been established to maintain consistent data repositories and systems that are controlled, accurate and available on a timely basis to support operational risk management.\nInformation Technology Risk Management\nOverview and Principles\nWe define technology risk as the risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement,\ninfluence and adoption of information technology. Technology risk includes risks potentially triggered by technology non-compliance with regulatory obligations, information security and privacy incidents, business disruption, technology internal control and process gaps, technology operational events and adoption of new business technologies.\nThe principal technology risks within our technology risk policy and risk appetite framework include:\n•\nThird party and vendor management risk;\n•\nBusiness disruption and technology resiliency risk;\n•\nTechnology change management risk;\n•\nCyber and information security risk;\n•\nTechnology asset and configuration risk; and\n•\nTechnology obsolescence risk.\nGovernance\nOur Board is responsible for the approval and oversight of our overall technology risk framework and program. It does so through its TOPS, which reviews and approves our technology risk policy and appetite framework annually.\nOur technology risk policy establishes our approach to our management of technology risk across our business. The policy identifies the responsibilities of individuals and committees charged with oversight of the management of technology risk and articulates a broad mandate that supports implementation of the technology risk framework.\nRisk control functions in the business are responsible for adopting and executing the  information technology risk framework and reporting requirements. They do this, in part, by developing and maintaining an inventory of critical applications and supporting infrastructure, as well as identifying, assessing and measuring technology risk utilizing the technology risk framework. They are also responsible for monitoring and evaluating risk on a continual basis using key risk indicators, risk reporting and adopting appropriate risk responses to risk issues.\nThe Chief Technology Risk Officer, a member of the CRO’s executive management team, leads the Enterprise Technology Risk Management (ETRM) function. ETRM is the separate risk function responsible for the technology risk strategy and appetite, and technology risk framework development and execution. ETRM also performs overall technology risk monitoring and reporting to the Board, and provides a separate view of the technology risk posture to executive leadership.\nState Street Corporation | 103\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe manage technology risks by:\n•\nCoordinating various risk assessment and risk management activities, including ERM operational risk programs;\n•\nEstablishing, through TORC and TOPS of the Board, the enterprise level technology risk and cyber risk appetite and limits;\n•\nProducing enterprise level risk reporting, aggregation, dashboards, profiles and risk appetite statements;\n•\nValidating appropriateness of reporting of information technology risks and risk acceptance to senior management risk committees and the Board;\n•\nPromoting a strong technology risk culture through communication;\n•\nServing as an escalation and challenge point for technology risk policy guidance, expectations and clarifications;\n•\nAssessing effectiveness of key enterprise information technology risk and internal control remediation programs; and\n•\nProviding risk oversight, challenge and monitoring for the Global Continuity and Third Party Vendor Management Program, including the collection of risk appetite, metrics and KRIs, and reviewing issue management processes and consistent program adoption.\nCyber-Security Risk Management\nCyber-security risk is managed as part of our overall information technology risk framework as outlined above under the direction of our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).\nWe recognize the significance of cyber-attacks and have taken steps to mitigate the risks associated with them. We have made significant investments in building a mature cyber-security program to leverage people, technology and processes to protect our systems and the data in our care. We have also implemented a program to help us better measure and manage the cyber-security risk we face when we engage with third parties for services.\nAll employees are required to adhere to our cyber-security policy and standards. Our centralized information security group provides education and training. This training includes a required annual online training class for all employees, multiple simulated phishing attacks and regular information security awareness materials.\nWe employ Information Security Officers to help the business better understand and manage their information security risks, as well as to work with the\ncentralized Information Security team to drive awareness and compliance throughout the business.\nWe use independent third parties to perform ethical hacks of key systems to help us better understand the effectiveness of our controls and to better implement more effective controls, and we engage with third parties to conduct reviews of our overall program to help us better align our cyber-security program with what is required of a large financial services organization.\nWe have an incident response program in place that is designed to enable a well-coordinated response to mitigate the impact of cyber-attacks, recover from the attack and to drive the appropriate level of communication to internal and external stakeholders.\nThe TORC assesses and manages the effectiveness of our cyber-security program, which is overseen by the TOPS of our Board. The TOPS receives regular cyber-security updates throughout the year and is responsible for reviewing and approving the program on an annual basis.\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket risk is defined by U.S. banking regulators as the risk of loss that could result from broad market movements, such as changes in the general level of interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. We are exposed to market risk in both our trading and certain of our non-trading, or asset-and-liability management, activities.\nInformation about the market risk associated with our trading activities is provided below under “Trading Activities.” Information about the market risk associated with our non-trading activities, which consists primarily of interest rate risk, is provided below under “Asset-and-Liability Management Activities.”\nTrading Activities\nIn the conduct of our trading activities, we assume market risk, the level of which is a function of our overall risk appetite, business objectives and liquidity needs, our clients' requirements and market volatility and our execution against those factors.\nWe engage in trading activities primarily to support our clients' needs and to contribute to our overall corporate earnings and liquidity. In connection with certain of these trading activities, we enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to support our clients' needs and to manage our interest rate and currency risk. These activities are generally intended to generate foreign exchange trading services revenue and to manage potential earnings volatility. In addition, we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets.\nState Street Corporation | 104\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities. With the growth of cross-border investing, our clients often enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios. As an active participant in the foreign exchange markets, we provide foreign exchange forward and option contracts in support of these client needs, and also act as a dealer in the currency markets.\nAs part of our trading activities, we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and entering into derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps, interest rate forward contracts and interest rate futures. As of December 31, 2020, the notional amount of these derivative contracts was $2.66 trillion, of which $2.65 trillion was composed of foreign exchange forward, swap and spot contracts. We seek to match positions closely with the objective of mitigating related currency and interest rate risk. All foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates.\nGovernance\nOur assumption of market risk in our trading activities is an integral part of our corporate risk appetite. Our Board reviews and oversees our management of market risk, including the approval of key market risk policies and the receipt and review of regular market risk reporting, as well as periodic updates on selected market risk topics.\nThe previously described TMRC (refer to \"Risk Committees\") oversees all market risk-taking activities across our business associated with trading. The TMRC, which reports to MRAC, is composed of members of ERM, our global markets business and our Global Treasury group, as well as our senior executives who manage our trading businesses and other members of management who possess specialized knowledge and expertise. The TMRC meets regularly to monitor the management of our trading market risk activities.\nOur business units identify, actively manage and are responsible for the market risks inherent in their businesses. A dedicated market risk management group within ERM, and other groups within ERM, work with those business units to assist them in the identification, assessment, monitoring, management and control of market risk, and assist business unit managers with their market risk management and measurement activities. ERM provides an additional line of oversight, support and coordination designed to promote the consistent identification, measurement and management of market risk across business\nunits, separate from those business units' discrete activities.\nThe ERM market risk management group is responsible for the management of corporate-wide market risk, the monitoring of key market risks and the development and maintenance of market risk management policies, guidelines and standards aligned with our corporate risk appetite. This group also establishes and approves market risk tolerance limits and trading authorities based on, but not limited to, measures of notional amounts, sensitivity, VaR and stress. Such limits and authorities are specified in our trading and market risk guidelines which govern our management of trading market risk.\nCorporate Audit separately assesses the design and operating effectiveness of the market risk controls within our business units and ERM. Other related responsibilities of Corporate Audit include the periodic review of ERM and business unit compliance with market risk policies, guidelines and corporate standards, as well as relevant regulatory requirements. We are subject to regular monitoring, reviews and supervisory exams of our market risk function by the Federal Reserve. In addition, we are regulated by, among others, the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission.\nRisk Appetite\nOur corporate market risk appetite is specified in policy statements that outline the governance, responsibilities and requirements surrounding the identification, measurement, analysis, management and communication of market risk arising from our trading activities. These policy statements also set forth the market risk control framework to monitor, support, manage and control this portion of our risk appetite. All groups involved in the management and control of market risk associated with trading activities are required to comply with the qualitative and quantitative elements of these policy statements. Our trading market risk control framework is composed of the following:\n•\nA trading market risk management process led by ERM, separate from the business units' discrete activities;\n•\nDefined responsibilities and authorities for the primary groups involved in trading market risk management;\n•\nA trading market risk measurement methodology that captures correlation effects and allows aggregation of market risk across risk types, markets and business lines;\n•\nDaily monitoring, analysis and reporting of market risk exposures associated\nState Street Corporation | 105\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nwith trading activities against market risk limits;\n•\nA defined limit structure and escalation process in the event of a market risk limit excess;\n•\nUse of VaR models to measure the one-day market risk exposure of trading positions;\n•\nUse of VaR as a ten-day-based regulatory capital measure of the market risk exposure of trading positions;\n•\nUse of non-VaR-based limits and other controls;\n•\nUse of stressed-VaR models, stress-testing analysis and scenario analysis to support the trading market risk measurement and management process by assessing how portfolios and global business lines perform under extreme market conditions;\n•\nUse of back-testing as a diagnostic tool to assess the accuracy of VaR models and other risk management techniques; and\n•\nA new product approval process that requires market risk teams to assess trading-related market risks and apply risk tolerance limits to proposed new products and business activities.\nWe use our CAP to assess our overall capital and liquidity in relation to our risk profile and provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital and liquidity levels. With respect to market risk associated with trading activities, our risk management and our calculations of regulatory capital are based primarily on our internal VaR models and stress testing analysis. As discussed in detail under “Value-at-Risk” below, VaR is measured daily by ERM.\nThe TMRC oversees our market risk exposure in relation to limits established within our risk appetite framework. These limits define threshold levels for VaR- and stressed VaR-based measures and are applicable to all trading positions subject to regulatory capital requirements. These limits are designed to prevent any undue concentration of market risk exposure, in light of the primarily non-proprietary nature of our trading activities. The risk appetite framework and associated limits are reviewed and approved by the Board's RC.\nCovered Positions\nOur trading positions are subject to regulatory market risk capital requirements if they meet the regulatory definition of a “covered position.” A covered position is generally defined by U.S. banking regulators as an on- or off-balance sheet position associated with the organization's trading activities\nthat is free of any restrictions on its tradability, but does not include intangible assets, certain credit derivatives recognized as guarantees and certain equity positions not publicly traded. All FX and commodity positions are considered covered positions, regardless of the accounting treatment they receive. The identification of covered positions for inclusion in our market risk capital framework is governed by our trading and market risk guidelines, which outlines the standards we use to determine whether a trading position is a covered position.\nOur covered positions consist primarily of the trading portfolios held by our global markets business. They also arise from certain positions held by our Global Treasury group. These trading positions include products such as foreign exchange spot, foreign exchange forwards, non-deliverable forwards, foreign exchange options, foreign exchange funding swaps, currency futures, financial futures and interest rate futures. New activities are analyzed to determine if the positions arising from such new activities meet the definition of a covered position and conform to our trading and market risk guidelines. This documented analysis, including any decisions with respect to market risk treatments, must receive approval from the TMRC.\nWe use spot rates, forward points, yield curves and discount factors imported from third-party sources to measure the value of our covered positions, and we use such values to mark our covered positions to market on a daily basis. These values are subject to separate validation by us in order to evaluate reasonableness and consistency with market experience. The mark-to-market gain or loss on spot transactions is calculated by applying the spot rate to the foreign currency principal and comparing the resultant base currency amount to the original transaction principal. The mark-to-market gain or loss on a forward foreign exchange contract or forward cash flow contract is determined as the difference between the life-to-date (historical) value of the cash flow and the value of the cash flow at the inception of the transaction. The mark-to-market gain or loss on interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows from each leg of the swap transaction.\nState Street Corporation | 106\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nValue-at-Risk and Stressed VaR\nWe use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies, including VaR, which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval. We use a risk measurement methodology to measure trading-related VaR daily. We have adopted standards for measuring trading-related VaR, and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk associated with our trading activities in conformity with currently applicable bank regulatory market risk requirements.\nWe utilize an internal VaR model to calculate our regulatory market risk capital requirements. We use a historical simulation model to calculate daily VaR- and stressed VaR-based measures for our covered positions in conformity with regulatory requirements. Our VaR model seeks to capture identified material risk factors associated with our covered positions, including risks arising from market movements such as changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and option-implied volatilities.\nWe have adopted standards and guidelines to value our covered positions which govern our VaR- and stressed VaR-based measures. Our regulatory VaR-based measure is calculated based on historical volatilities of market risk factors during a two-year observation period calibrated to a one-tail, 99% confidence interval and a ten-business-day holding period. We also use the same platform to calculate a one-tail, 99% confidence interval, one-business-day VaR for internal risk management purposes. A 99% one-tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses are not expected to exceed the estimated VaR more than 1% of the time, or less than three business days out of a year.\nOur market risk models, including our VaR model, are subject to change in connection with the governance, validation and back-testing processes described below. These models can change as a result of changes in our business activities, our historical experiences, market forces and events, regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors. In addition, the models are subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. Changes in our models may result in changes in our measurements of our market risk exposures, including VaR, and related measures, including regulatory capital. These changes could result in material changes in those risk measurements and related measures as calculated and compared from period to period.\nValue-at-Risk Measures\nVaR measures are based on the most recent two years of historical price movements for instruments and related risk factors to which we have exposure. The instruments in question are limited to\nforeign exchange spot, forward and options contracts and interest rate contracts, including futures and interest rate swaps. Historically, these instruments have exhibited a higher degree of liquidity relative to other available capital markets instruments. As a result, the VaR measures shown reflect our ability to rapidly adjust exposures in highly dynamic markets. For this reason, risk inventory, in the form of net open positions, across all currencies is typically limited. In addition, long and short positions in major, as well as minor, currencies provide risk offsets that limit our potential downside exposure.\nOur VaR methodology uses a historical simulation approach based on market-observed changes in foreign exchange rates, U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates and implied volatilities, and incorporates the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions. Our VaR model incorporates approximately 5,000 risk factors and includes correlations among currency, interest rates and other market rates.\nAll VaR measures are subject to limitations and must be interpreted accordingly. Some, but not all, of the limitations of our VaR methodology include the following:\n•\nCompared to a shorter observation period, a two-year observation period is slower to reflect increases in market volatility (although temporary increases in market volatility will affect the calculation of VaR for a longer period); consequently, in periods of sudden increases in volatility or increasing volatility, in each case relative to the prior two-year period, the calculation of VaR may understate current risk;\n•\nCompared to a longer observation period, a two-year observation period may not reflect as many past periods of volatility in the markets, because such past volatility is no longer in the observation period; consequently, historical market scenarios of high volatility, even if similar to current or likely future market circumstances, may fall outside the two-year observation period, resulting in a potential understatement of current risk;\n•\nThe VaR-based measure is calibrated to a specified level of confidence and does not indicate the potential magnitude of losses beyond this confidence level;\n•\nIn certain cases, VaR-based measures approximate the impact of changes in risk factors on the values of positions and portfolios; this may happen because the number of inputs included in the VaR model is necessarily limited; for example, yield\nState Street Corporation | 107\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\ncurve risk factors do not exist for all future dates;\n•\nThe use of historical market information may not be predictive of future events, particularly those that are extreme in nature; this “backward-looking” limitation can cause VaR to understate or overstate risk;\n•\nThe effect of extreme and rare market movements is difficult to estimate; this may result from non-linear risk sensitivities as well as the potential for actual volatility and correlation levels to differ from assumptions implicit in the VaR calculations; and\n•\nIntra-day risk is not captured.\nWe calculate a stressed VaR-based measure using the same model we use to calculate VaR, but with model inputs calibrated to historical data from a range of continuous twelve-month periods that reflect significant financial stress. The stressed VaR model is designed to identify the second-worst outcome occurring in the worst continuous one-year rolling period since July 2007. This stressed VaR meets the regulatory requirement as the rolling ten-day period with an outcome that is worse than 99% of other outcomes during that twelve-month period of financial stress. For each portfolio, the stress period is determined algorithmically by seeking the one-year time horizon that produces the largest ten-business-day VaR from within the available historical data. This historical data set includes the financial crisis of 2008, the highly volatile period surrounding the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the Standard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt in August 2011. As the historical data set used to determine the stress period expands over time, future market stress events will be incorporated.\nStress Testing\nWe have a corporate-wide stress testing program in place that incorporates an array of techniques to measure the potential loss we could suffer in a hypothetical scenario of adverse economic and financial conditions. We also monitor concentrations of risk such as concentration by branch, risk component, and currency pairs. We conduct stress testing on a daily basis based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur, and we also perform stress testing\nas part of the Federal Reserve's CCAR process. Stress testing is conducted, analyzed and reported at the corporate, trading desk, division and risk-factor level (for example, exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk).\nStress testing results and limits are actively monitored on a daily basis by ERM and reported to the TMRC. Limit breaches are addressed by ERM risk managers in conjunction with the business units, escalated as appropriate, and reviewed by the TMRC if material. In addition, we have established several action triggers that prompt immediate review by management and the implementation of a remediation plan.\nWe perform scenario analysis daily based on selected historical stress events that are relevant to our positions in order to estimate the potential impact to our current portfolio should similar market conditions recur. Relevant scenarios are chosen from an inventory of historical financial stresses and applied to our current portfolio. These historical event scenarios involve spot foreign exchange, credit, equity, unforeseen geo-political events and natural disasters, and government and central bank intervention scenarios. Examples of the specific historical scenarios we incorporate in our stress testing program may include the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S. and the 2008 financial crisis. We continue to update our inventory of historical stress scenarios as new stress conditions emerge in the financial markets.\nAs each of the historical stress events is associated with a different time horizon, we normalize results by scaling down the longer horizon events to a ten-day horizon and keeping the shorter horizon events (i.e., events that are shorter than ten days) at their original terms. We also conduct sensitivity analysis daily to calculate the impact of a large predefined shock in a specific risk factor or a group of risk factors on our current portfolio. These predefined shocks include parallel and non-parallel yield curve shifts and foreign exchange spot and volatility surface shifts. In a parallel shift scenario, we apply a constant factor shift across all yield curve tenors. In a non-parallel shift scenario, we apply different shock levels to different tenors of a yield curve, rather than shifting the entire curve by a constant amount. Non-parallel shifts include steepening, flattening and butterflies.\nState Street Corporation | 108\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nValidation and Back-Testing\nWe perform frequent back-testing to assess the accuracy of our VaR-based model in estimating loss at the stated confidence level. This back-testing involves the comparison of estimated VaR model outputs to daily, actual profit-and-loss (P&L) outcomes observed from daily market movements. We back-test our VaR model using “clean” P&L, which excludes non-trading revenue such as fees, commissions and NII, as well as estimated revenue from intra-day trading.\nOur VaR definition of trading losses excludes items that are not specific to the price movement of the trading assets and liabilities themselves, such as fees, commissions, changes to reserves and gains or losses from intra-day activity.\nWe experienced three back-testing exceptions in 2020 and two back-testing exceptions in 2019. At a 99% confidence interval, the statistical expectation for a VaR model is to witness one exception every hundred trading days (or two to three exceptions per year). The 2020 back-testing exceptions were all noted during the March 2020 market turmoil where some of the largest risk factor shifts since the 2007/2008 financial crisis were observed.\nOur model validation process also evaluates the integrity of our VaR models through the use of regular outcome analysis. This outcome analysis includes back-testing, which compares the VaR model's predictions to actual outcomes using out-of-sample information. Consistent with regulatory guidance, the back-testing compared “clean” P&L, defined above, with the one-day VaR produced by the model. The back-testing was performed for a time period not used for model development. The number of occurrences where “clean” trading-book P&L exceeded the one-day VaR was within our expected VaR tolerance level.\nMarket Risk Reporting\nOur ERM market risk management group is responsible for market risk monitoring and reporting. We use a variety of systems and controlled market feeds from third-party services to compile data for several daily, weekly and monthly management reports.\nThe following tables present VaR and stressed VaR associated with our trading activities for covered positions held during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as measured by our VaR methodology. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for each trading activity. This effect arises because the risks present in our trading activities are not perfectly correlated.\nThe average of our stressed VaR-based measure was approximately $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to an average of approximately $32 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe stressed VaR-based measure as of December 31, 2020 was relatively unchanged compared to December 31, 2019. Our average stressed VaR-based measure increased as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to larger FX and interest rate positions.\nThe VaR-based measures presented in the preceding tables are primarily a reflection of the overall level of market volatility and our appetite for taking market risk in our trading activities. Overall levels of volatility have been low both on an absolute basis and relative to the historical information observed at the beginning of the period used for the calculations. Both the ten-day VaR-based measures and the stressed VaR-based measures are based on\nState Street Corporation | 109\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nhistorical changes observed during rolling ten-day periods for the portfolios as of the close of business each day over the past one-year period.\nWe may in the future modify and adjust our models and methodologies used to calculate VaR and stressed VaR, subject to regulatory review and approval, and these modifications and adjustments may result in changes in our VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures.\nThe following tables present the VaR and stressed-VaR associated with our trading activities attributable to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and volatility risk as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The totals of the VaR-based and stressed VaR-based measures for the three attributes in total exceeded the related total VaR and total stressed VaR presented in the foregoing tables as of each period-end, primarily due to the benefits of diversification across risk types. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for each trading activity. This effect arises because the risks present in our trading activities are not perfectly correlated.\n(1)\nFor purposes of risk attribution by component, foreign exchange refers only to the risk from market movements in period-end rates.  Forwards, futures, options and swaps with maturities greater than period-end have embedded interest rate risk that is captured by the measures used for interest rate risk.  Accordingly, the interest rate risk embedded in these foreign exchange instruments is included in the interest rate risk component.\nAsset and Liability Management Activities\nThe primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable NII under varying economic conditions, while protecting the economic value of the assets and liabilities carried on our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. While many market factors affect the level of NII and the economic value of our assets and liabilities, one of the most significant factors is our exposure to movements in interest rates. Most of our NII is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our businesses. We invest these client deposits in assets that conform generally to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities, including the currency composition of our significant non-U.S. dollar denominated client liabilities.\nWe quantify NII sensitivity using an earnings simulation model that includes our expectations for new business growth, changes in balance sheet mix and investment portfolio positioning. This measure compares our baseline view of NII over a twelve-month horizon, based on our internal forecast of interest rates, to a wide range of rate shocks. Table 38, Key Interest Rates for Baseline Forecasts, presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Our December 31, 2020 baseline forecast assumes no changes by the Federal Reserve over the next 12 months.\nIn Table 39: Net Interest Income Sensitivity, we report the expected change in NII over the next twelve months from instantaneous shocks to various tenors on the yield curve, including the impacts from U.S. and non-U.S. rates. Each scenario assumes no management action is taken to mitigate the adverse effects of interest rate changes on our financial performance. While investment securities balances can fluctuate with the level of rates as prepayment\nState Street Corporation | 110\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nassumptions change, our modeling approach in both the December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 reporting periods was to keep our balance sheet consistent with our baseline outlook in both higher and lower rate scenarios. Beginning with the December 31, 2020 reporting period, we have enhanced our NII sensitivity methodology so that the full impact of the shock is realized for all currencies even if the result is negative interest rates.  Prior to the December 31, 2020 reporting period, our results in lower rate scenarios were impacted by an assumed floor at zero for certain currencies including U.S. dollar. Given the higher level of market interest rates during the December 31, 2019 reporting period, our prior year’s reported NII sensitivity results would not materially change using the new flooring methodology.\n(1)\nThe short end is 0-3 months. The long end is 5 years and above. Interim term points are interpolated.\nAs of December 31, 2020, NII is expected to benefit from both parallel increases and decreases in interest rates. Compared to December 31, 2019, our NII is more sensitive to parallel rate increases primarily driven by higher levels of deposits and assumptions for lower deposit betas. Our positioning to parallel rate decreases has shifted to benefit NII due to passing through negative rates on higher deposit balances with higher betas.\nU.S. dollar NII as of December 31, 2020 is positioned to benefit from both parallel increases and decreases in interest rates. Compared to December 31, 2019, our U.S. dollar NII benefit to higher rates has increased primarily due to higher levels of deposits and assumptions for lower deposit betas. Compared to December 31, 2019, our U.S. dollar NII sensitivity to lower rates changed from NII exposure to a benefit as a result of passing through negative rates on higher deposit balances with higher betas.\nNII is still positioned to benefit from changes in non-U.S. interest rates with the majority of our sensitivity derived from the short-end of the curve given deposit pricing expectations. Compared to December 31, 2019, our non-U.S. benefit from higher rates is largely unchanged while the benefit from lower rates has increased. The increased benefit from lower rates is mainly driven by passing through negative rates on higher deposit balances with higher betas.\nEVE sensitivity is a discounted cash flow model designed to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities under a series of interest rate shocks over a long-term horizon. In the following table, we report our EVE sensitivity to 200 bps instantaneous rate shocks, relative to spot interest rates. Management compares the change in EVE sensitivity against our aggregate Tier 1 and Tier 2 risk-based capital, calculated in conformity with current applicable regulatory requirements. EVE sensitivity is dependent on the timing of interest and principal cash flows. Also, the measure only evaluates the spot balance sheet and does not include the impact of new business assumptions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, EVE sensitivity remains exposed to upward shifts in interest rates. Compared to December 31, 2019, the change in the up 200 bps instantaneous shock scenario was primarily driven by the benefit from increased liability duration from deposit modeling updates and hedging activity. Compared to December 31, 2019, the change in the down 200 bps scenario was primarily driven by decreased liability duration from higher deposit betas, combined with a full realization of the shock.\nState Street Corporation | 111\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBoth NII sensitivity and EVE sensitivity are routinely monitored as market conditions change. For additional information about our Asset and Liability Management Activities, refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, \"Risk Management\".\nModel Risk Management\nThe use of models is widespread throughout the financial services industry, with large and complex organizations relying on sophisticated models to support numerous aspects of their financial decision making. The models contemporaneously represent both a significant advancement in financial management and a source of risk. In large banking organizations like us, model results influence business decisions, and model failure could have a harmful effect on our financial performance. As a result, the MRM Framework seeks to mitigate our model risk.\nOur MRM program has three principal components:\n•\nA model risk governance program that defines roles and responsibilities, including the authority to restrict model usage, provides policies and guidance, monitors compliance and reports regularly to the Board on the overall degree of model risk across the corporation;\n•\nA model development process that focuses on sound design and computational accuracy, and includes activities designed to test for robustness, stability and sensitivity to assumptions; and\n•\nAn independent model validation function designed to verify that models are conceptually sound, computationally accurate, are performing as expected, and are in line with their design objectives.\nThe MRM Framework, highlighted above, also provides insight\nand guidance into addressing key model risks that arise. In 2020, MRM required enhanced communication, prioritization of reviews due to model changes, greater documentation related to overlays, and enhanced on-going monitoring to mitigate the increased model risk brought on by volatility\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGovernance\nModels used in the regulatory capital calculation can only be deployed for use after undergoing a model validation by ERM's MRM group. The model validation results and/or a decision by the Model Risk Committee must permit model usage or the model may not be used.\nERM’s MRM group is responsible for defining the corporate-wide model risk governance framework, maintaining policies that achieve the framework’s\nobjectives. All regulatory capital calculation models, including any artificial intelligence and machine learning models, must comply with the model risk governance framework and corresponding policies. The team is responsible for overall model risk governance capabilities, with particular emphasis in the areas of model validation, model risk reporting, model performance monitoring, tracking of new model development status and committee-level review and challenge.\nMRC, which is composed of senior managers responsible for representing functional areas and business units with key models across the organization, reports to MRAC, and provides guidance and oversight to the MRM function.\nModel Development and Usage\nModels are developed under standards governing data sourcing, methodology selection and model integrity testing. Model development includes a statement of purpose to align development with intended use. It also includes a comparison of alternative approaches to promote a sound modeling approach.\nModel developers conduct an assessment of data quality and relevance. The development teams conduct a variety of tests of the accuracy, robustness and stability of each model.\nModel owners submit models to the MVG for validation on a regular basis, as per the existing policy.\nModel Validation\nMVG is part of MRM within ERM and performs model validations and reviews. MVG is independent, as contemplated by applicable bank regulatory requirements, of both the developers and users of the models. MVG validates models through an evaluation process that assesses the appropriateness, accuracy, and suitability of data inputs, methodologies, documentation, assumptions, and processing code. Model validation also encompasses an assessment of model performance, sensitivity, and robustness, as well as a model’s potential limitations given its particular assumptions or deficiencies. Based on the results of its review, MVG issues a model use decision and may require remedial actions and/or compensating controls on model use. MVG also maintains a model risk rating system, which assigns a risk rating to each model based on an assessment of a model's inherent and residual risks. These ratings aid in the understanding and reporting of model risk across the model portfolio, and enable the triaging of needs for remediation.\nAlthough model validation is the primary method of subjecting models to independent review and challenge, in practice, a multi-step governance\nState Street Corporation | 112\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nprocess provides the opportunity for challenge by multiple parties. First, MVG conducts a model validation and issues a model use decision.  MVG communicates their result as one of the following three outcomes: “Approved”, “Approved with conditions”, or “Not Approved”.  There are two ways in which a model can be deemed “Not approved for Use” given a validation:  1) the aggregation of the model scoring within MRM’s Model Risk Rating System (MRRS) model is poor enough to result in a “high” rating, or 2) the scoring of one or more MRRS model element(s) is deemed “critical” resulting in an automatic “high” rating irrespective of the other elements as the “critical” element(s) undermines the model. Second, these decisions may be reviewed, challenged, and confirmed by the MRC. Finally, model use decisions, risk ratings, and overall levels of model risk may be reported to and reviewed by MRAC. MRM also reports regularly on model risk issues to the Board.\nStrategic Risk Management\nWe define strategic risk as the current or prospective impact on earnings or capital arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of strategic initiatives, or lack of responsiveness to industry-wide changes. Strategic risks are influenced by changes in the competitive environment; decline in market performance or changes in our business activities; and the potential secondary impacts of reputational risks, not already captured as market, interest rate, credit, operational, model or liquidity risks. We incorporate strategic risk into our assessment of our business plans and risk and capital management processes. Active management of strategic risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business.\nSeparating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and strategic risk is sometimes difficult. For instance, the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss, while the impact on our reputation and consequently the potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a strategic risk loss. An additional example of strategic risk is the integration of a major acquisition. Failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business, and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue, would be classified as a loss due to strategic risk.\nStrategic risk is managed with a long-term focus. Techniques for its assessment and management include the development of business plans, which are subject to robust review and challenge from senior management and the Board of Directors, as well as a formal review and approval process for all new\nbusiness and product proposals. The potential impact of the various elements of strategic risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision. We use a combination of historical earnings volatility, scenario analysis, stress-testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on us attributable to strategic risk. Management and control of strategic risks are generally the responsibility of the business units, with oversight from the control functions, as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk management processes.\nCapital\nManaging our capital involves evaluating whether our actual and projected levels of capital are commensurate with our risk profile, are in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements and are sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives. We assess capital adequacy based on relevant regulatory capital requirements, as well as our own internal capital goals, targets and other relevant metrics.\nFramework\nOur objective with respect to management of our capital is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs, including funding corporate growth and supporting clients’ cash management needs, and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors. We strive to maintain an appropriate level of capital, commensurate with our risk profile, on which an attractive return to shareholders is expected to be realized over both the short and long-term, while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and complying with regulatory capital requirements.\nOur capital management focuses on our risk exposures, the regulatory requirements applicable to us with respect to multiple capital measures, the evaluations and resulting credit ratings of the major independent rating agencies, our return on capital at both the consolidated and line-of-business level and our capital position relative to our peers.\nAssessment of our overall capital adequacy includes the comparison of capital sources with capital uses, as well as the consideration of the quality and quantity of the various components of capital. The assessment seeks to determine the optimal level of capital and composition of capital instruments to satisfy all constituents of capital, with the lowest overall cost to shareholders. Other factors considered in our assessment of capital adequacy are strategic and contingency planning, stress testing and planned capital actions.\nState Street Corporation | 113\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCapital Adequacy Process (CAP)\nOur primary federal banking regulator is the Federal Reserve. Both we and State Street Bank are subject to the minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve and defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act. State Street Bank must exceed the regulatory capital thresholds for “well capitalized” in order for our Parent Company to maintain its status as a financial holding company. Accordingly, one of our primary objectives with respect to capital management is to exceed all applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements and for State Street Bank to be “well-capitalized” under the PCA guidelines established by the FDIC. Our capital management activities are conducted as part of our corporate-wide CAP and associated Capital Policy and Guidelines.\nWe consider capital adequacy to be a key element of our financial well-being, which affects our ability to attract and maintain client relationships; operate effectively in the global capital markets; and satisfy regulatory, security holders and shareholder needs. Capital is one of several elements that affect our credit ratings and the ratings of our principal subsidiaries.\nIn conformity with our Capital Policy and Guidelines, we strive to achieve and maintain specific internal capital levels, not just at a point in time, but over time and during periods of stress, to account for changes in our strategic direction, evolving economic conditions, and financial and market volatility. We have developed and implemented a corporate-wide CAP to assess our overall capital in relation to our risk profile and to provide a comprehensive strategy for maintaining appropriate capital levels. The CAP considers material risks under multiple scenarios, with an emphasis on stress scenarios, and encompasses existing processes and systems used to measure our capital adequacy.\nCapital Contingency Planning\nContingency planning is an integral component of capital management. The objective of contingency planning is to monitor current and forecast levels of select capital, liquidity and other measures that serve as early indicators of a potentially adverse capital or liquidity adequacy situation. These measures are one of the inputs used to set our internal capital adequacy level. We review these measures annually for appropriateness and relevance in relation to our financial budget and capital plan.  In addition, we maintain an inventory of capital contingency actions designed to conserve or generate capital to support the unique risks in our business model, our client and investor demands and regulatory requirements.\nStress Testing\nWe administer a robust business-wide stress-testing program that executes stress tests each year to assess the institution’s capital adequacy and/or future performance under adverse conditions. Our stress testing program is structured around what we determine to be the key risks inherent in our business, as assessed through a recurring material risk identification process. The material risk identification process represents a bottom-up approach to identifying the institution’s most significant risk exposures across all on- and off-balance sheet risk-taking activities, including credit, market, liquidity, interest rate, operational, fiduciary, business, reputation and regulatory risks. These key risks serve as an organizing principle for much of our risk management framework, as well as reporting, including the “risk dashboard” provided to the Board.\nIn connection with the focus on our key risks, each stress test incorporates idiosyncratic loss events tailored to our unique risk profile and business activities. Due to the nature of our business model and our consolidated statement of condition, our risks differ from those of a traditional commercial bank. Over the past few years, stress scenarios have included a deep recession in the U.S., including impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, a break-up of the Eurozone, a severe recession in China and an oil shock precipitated by turmoil in the Middle East/North Africa region.\nThe Federal Reserve requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, which includes us, to submit a capital plan on an annual basis. The Federal Reserve uses its annual CCAR process, which incorporates hypothetical financial and economic stress scenarios, to review those capital plans and assess whether banking organizations have capital planning processes that account for idiosyncratic risks and provide for sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. As part of its CCAR process, the Federal Reserve assesses each organization’s capital adequacy, capital planning process and plans to distribute capital, such as dividend payments or stock purchase programs. Management and Board risk committees review, challenge and approve CCAR results and assumptions before submission to the Federal Reserve.\nThrough the evaluation of our capital adequacy and/or future performance under adverse conditions, the stress testing process provides  us important insights for capital planning, risk management and strategic decision-making.\nState Street Corporation | 114\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGovernance\nIn order to support integrated decision making, we have identified three management elements to aid in the compatibility and coordination of our CAP:\n•\nRisk Management - identification, measurement, monitoring and forecasting of different types of risk and their combined impact on capital adequacy;\n•\nCapital management - determination of optimal capital levels; and\n•\nBusiness Management - strategic planning, budgeting, forecasting and performance management.\nWe have a hierarchical structure supporting appropriate committee review of relevant risk and capital information. The ongoing responsibility for capital management rests with our Treasurer. The Capital Management group within Global Treasury is responsible for the Capital Policy and Guidelines, development of the Capital Plan, the oversight of global capital management and optimization.\nThe MRAC provides oversight of our capital management, our capital adequacy, our internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies. In addition, MRAC approves our balance sheet strategy and related activities. The Board’s RC assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities related to the assessment and management of risk and capital. Our Capital Policy is reviewed and approved annually by the Board's RC.\nGlobal Systemically Important Bank\nWe have been identified by the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision as a G-SIB. Our designation as a G-SIB is based on a number of factors, as evaluated by banking regulators, and requires us to maintain an additional capital surcharge above the minimum capital ratios set forth in the Basel III rule.\nWe and our depositary institution subsidiaries are subject to the current Basel III minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratio guidelines.\nAdditional information about G-SIBs is provided under \"Regulatory Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards\" in \"Supervision and Regulation\" in Business in this Form 10-K.\nRegulatory Capital\nWe and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to the U.S. Basel III framework. Provisions of the Basel III rule became effective with full implementation on January 1, 2019. We are also subject to the final market risk capital rule issued by U.S. banking regulators effective as of January 2013.\nThe Basel III rule provides for two frameworks for monitoring capital adequacy: the “standardized”\napproach and the “advanced” approaches, applicable to advanced approaches banking organizations, like us. The standardized approach prescribes standardized calculations for credit RWA, including specified risk weights for certain on- and off-balance sheet exposures.\nThe advanced approaches consist of the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based Approach used for the calculation of RWA related to credit risk, and the Advanced Measurement Approach used for the calculation of RWA related to operational risk.\nThe market risk capital rule requires us to use internal models to calculate daily measures of VaR, which reflect general market risk for certain of our trading positions defined by the rule as “covered positions,” as well as stressed-VaR measures to supplement the VaR measures. The rule also requires a public disclosure composed of qualitative and quantitative information about the market risk associated with our trading activities and our related VaR and stressed-VaR measures. The qualitative and quantitative information required by the rule is provided under \"Market Risk\" included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nAs required by the Dodd-Frank Act enacted in 2010, and the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) rule enacted in 2020, we and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to a \"capital floor,\" also referred to as the Collins Amendment, in the assessment of our regulatory capital adequacy, including the capital conservation buffer (CCB) and the SCB, for the advanced approach and standardized approach, respectively, and a countercyclical capital buffer. The countercyclical buffer is currently set to zero by the U.S. federal banking agencies. In addition, we are subject to a G-SIB surcharge. Our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches.\nThe SCB replaced, under the standardized approach, the capital conservation buffer with a buffer calculated as the difference between the institution’s starting and lowest projected CET1 ratio under the CCAR severely adverse scenario plus planned common stock dividend payments (as a percentage of RWA) from the fourth through seventh quarter of the CCAR planning horizon. The SCB requirement, which became effective October 1, 2020, can be no less than 2.5% of RWA.  Breaching the SCB or other regulatory buffer or surcharge will limit a banking organization’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.  The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero by U.S. banking regulators.\nState Street Corporation | 115\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents the regulatory capital structure and related regulatory capital ratios for us and State Street Bank as of the dates indicated. We are subject to the more stringent of the risk-based capital ratios calculated under the standardized approach and those calculated under the advanced approaches in the assessment of our capital adequacy under applicable bank regulatory standards.\n(1)\nOther adjustments within CET1 capital primarily include the overfunded portion of our defined benefit pension plan obligation net of associated deferred tax liabilities, disallowed deferred tax assets, and other required credit risk based deductions.\n(2)\nIncludes a CVA which reflects the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts. We used a simple CVA approach in conformity with the Basel III advanced approaches.\n(3)\nUnder the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financial condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes. An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs.\n(4)\nMinimum requirements include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and a stress capital buffer of 2.5% for advanced and standardized, respectively, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.0% and a countercyclical buffer of 0%.\n(5)\nMinimum requirements include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, a G-SIB surcharge of 1.5% and a countercyclical buffer of 0%.\nNA\nNot applicable\nOur CET1 capital increased $2.16 billion as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, primarily driven by net income and accumulated other comprehensive income in the year ended December 31, 2020, partially offset by capital distributions from common and preferred stock dividends and first quarter 2020 common stock repurchases.\nOur Tier 1 capital increased $1.67 billion as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 under both the advanced approaches and standardized approach due to increase in CET1 capital, partially offset by the redemption of all outstanding Series C preferred stock. Total capital increased under the advanced approaches and standardized approach by $1.54 billion and $1.60 billion, respectively, due to an increase in our Tier 1 capital, partially offset by a decrease in Tier 2 capital.\nState Street Corporation | 116\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe table below presents a roll-forward of CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(1)\nWe adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, on January 1, 2020. Please refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for additional information.\nThe following table presents a roll-forward of the Basel III advanced approaches and standardized approach RWA for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(1)\nUnder the advanced approaches, includes CVA RWA.\n(2)\nIncludes assets not in a definable category, non-material portfolio, cleared transactions, other wholesale, cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks and equity exposures.\n(3)\nDecember 2019 includes a 6% credit risk supervisory charge.\nState Street Corporation | 117\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs of December 31, 2020, total advanced approaches RWA increased $5.34 billion compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in credit risk RWA, partially offset by a decrease in operational RWA. The increase in credit risk RWA was primarily driven by an increase in investment securities - wholesale RWA, loans RWA, and repo-style transactions RWA.\nAs of December 31, 2020, total standardized approach RWA increased $13.08 billion compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to higher credit risk RWA. The increase in credit risk RWA was primarily driven by an increase in repo-style transactions RWA, loans RWA, and all other RWA.\nThe regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2020, presented in Table 41: Regulatory Capital Structure and Related Regulatory Capital Ratios, are calculated under the standardized approach and advanced approaches in conformity with the Basel III rule. The advanced approaches based ratios reflect calculations and determinations with respect to our capital and related matters as of December 31, 2020, based on our and external data, quantitative formulae, statistical models, historical correlations and assumptions, collectively referred to as “advanced systems,” in effect and used by us for those purposes as of the time we first reported such ratios in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q or an annual report on Form 10-K. Significant components of these advanced systems involve the exercise of judgment by us and our regulators, and our advanced systems may not, individually or collectively, precisely represent or calculate the scenarios, circumstances, outputs or other results for which they are designed or intended.\nOur advanced systems are subject to update and periodic revalidation in response to changes in our business activities and our historical experiences, forces and events experienced by the market broadly or by individual financial institutions, changes in regulations and regulatory interpretations and other factors, and are also subject to continuing regulatory review and approval. For example, a significant operational loss experienced by another financial institution, even if we do not experience a related loss, could result in a material change in the output of our advanced systems and a corresponding material change in our risk exposures, our total RWA and our capital ratios compared to prior periods. An operational loss that we experience could also result in a material change in our capital requirements for operational risk under the advanced approaches, depending on the severity of the loss event, its characterization among the seven Basel-defined UOM, and the stability of the distributional approach for a particular UOM, and without direct correlation to\nthe effects of the loss event, or the timing of such effects, on our results of operations.\nDue to the influence of changes in these advanced systems, whether resulting from changes in data inputs, regulation or regulatory supervision or interpretation, specific to us or market activities or experiences or other updates or factors, we expect that our advanced systems and our capital ratios calculated in conformity with the Basel III rule will change and may be volatile over time, and that those latter changes or volatility could be material as calculated and measured from period to period. The full effects of the Basel III rule on us and State Street Bank are therefore subject to further evaluation and also to further regulatory guidance, action or rule-making.\nState Street Corporation | 118\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTier 1 and Supplementary Leverage Ratios\nWe are subject to a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and a supplementary leverage ratio. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and adjusted quarterly average on-balance sheet assets. The Tier 1 leverage ratio differs from the SLR primarily in that the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio is a quarterly average of on-balance sheet assets, while the SLR additionally includes off-balance sheet exposures. We must maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.\nWe are also subject to a minimum SLR of 3%, and as a U.S. G-SIB, we must maintain a 2% SLR buffer in order to avoid any limitations on distributions to shareholders and discretionary bonus payments to certain executives. If we do not maintain this buffer, limitations on these distributions and discretionary bonus payments would be increasingly stringent based upon the extent of the shortfall.\n(1)\nTier 1 leverage ratios were calculated in conformity with the Basel III rule.\n(2)\nThe SLR rule requires that, as of January 1, 2018, (i) State Street Bank maintains an SLR of at least 6.0% to be well capitalized under the U.S. banking regulators’ Prompt Corrective Action Framework and (ii) we maintain an SLR of at least 5.0% to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. In addition to the SLR, State Street Bank is subject to a well-capitalized Tier 1 leverage ratio requirement of 5.0%.\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)\nIn 2016, the Federal Reserve released its final rule on TLAC, LTD and clean holding company requirements for U.S. domiciled G-SIBs, such as us, that is intended to improve the resiliency and resolvability of certain U.S. banking organizations through enhanced prudential standards. Among other things, the TLAC final rule requires us to comply with minimum requirements for external TLAC and external LTD effective January 1, 2019. Specifically, we must hold:\nAs of April 1, 2020, the TLAC and LTD requirements calibrated to the SLR denominator reflect the deduction of certain central bank balances as prescribed by the regulatory relief implemented under the EGRRCPA.\nThe following table presents external LTD and external TLAC as of December 31, 2020.\nAdditional information about TLAC is provided under \"Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity\" in \"Supervision and Regulation\" in Business in this Form 10-K.\nState Street Corporation | 119\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRegulatory Developments\nIn April 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule which would replace the current 2.0% SLR buffer for G-SIBs, with a buffer equal to 50% of their G-SIB surcharge. This proposal would also make conforming modifications to our TLAC and eligible LTD requirements applicable to G-SIBs. At this point in time, it is unclear whether this proposal will be implemented as proposed.\nIn November 2019, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking agencies issued a final rule to implement the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) as a replacement of the Current Exposure Method for calculating exposure-at-default of derivatives exposures. Mandatory compliance with the final rule is required by January 1, 2022.\nOn March 4, 2020, U.S. federal banking agencies issued the SCB final rule that replaces, under the standardized approach, the capital conservation buffer (2.5%) with a SCB calculated as the difference between an institution’s starting and lowest projected CET1 ratio under the CCAR severely adverse scenario plus planned common stock dividend payments (as a percentage of RWA) from the fourth through seventh quarter of the CCAR planning horizon. The SCB requirement, which became effective October 1, 2020, can be no less than 2.5% of RWA.\nThe Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule effective in March 2020 and later finalized on a permanent basis on August 26, 2020, which revised the definition of eligible retained income for all U.S. banking organizations. The revised definition of eligible retained income makes any automatic limitations on capital distributions, where a banking organization's regulatory ratios were to decline below the respective minimum requirements, take effect on a more gradual basis.\nFollowing the launch of the MMLF program, which we participate in, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule on March 19, 2020 (followed by a final rule on September 29, 2020), allowing Bank Holding Companies (BHCs) to exclude assets purchased with the MMLF program from their RWA, total leverage exposure and average total consolidated assets. For the quarter ended December 31, 2020, we deducted $4.2 billion of MMLF program average HTM securities.\nOn March 27, 2020, the BCBS announced the deferral of the implementation of the revisions to the Basel III framework to January 1, 2023. As of now, the U.S. federal banking agencies have not formally proposed the implementation of the BCBS revisions.\nEffective April 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking agencies adopted a final rule as part of EGRRCPA that establishes a deduction for qualifying central bank deposits from a custodial banking organization’s total leverage exposure equal to the lesser of (i) the total amount of funds the custodial banking organization and its consolidated subsidiaries have on deposit at qualifying central banks and (ii) the total amount of client funds on deposit at the custodial banking organization that are linked to fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping accounts. For the quarter ended December 31, 2020, we deducted $76.7 billion of average balances held on deposit at central banks from the denominator used in the calculation of our SLR, based on this custodial banking deduction.\nIn addition to the regulatory relief granted to custodial banks under the EGRRCPA, an SLR interim final rule released on April 1, 2020 allows all BHCs to deduct their deposits at Federal Reserve Banks and their investments in U.S. Treasuries from their total leverage exposure on a temporary basis, from the second quarter of 2020 through the first quarter of 2021. The temporary deduction of our investment in U.S. Treasuries is incremental to the existing central bank placement deduction granted to custodian banks under EGRRCPA. For the quarter ended December 31, 2020, we deducted $13.6 billion invested in U.S. Treasuries from our total leverage exposure.\nOn May 15, 2020, the U.S. federal banking agencies released an interim final rule that also permits insured depository institution subsidiaries of BHCs to temporarily exclude deposits at Federal Reserve Banks and investments in U.S. Treasuries from their total leverage exposure, subject to certain conditions. State Street Bank has elected not to apply such exclusions as of December 31, 2020.\nOn June 25, 2020, we were notified by the Federal Reserve of the results from the 2020 DFAST stress test, including our preliminary SCB of 2.5%. Additionally, included in this notification and in light of the considerable economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, all participating CCAR banking organizations were required to resubmit their capital plans by November 2, 2020, based on updated scenarios provided by the Federal Reserve on September 17, 2020.\nIn line with the decision to administer a new stress test, the Federal Reserve decided to limit the ability of all CCAR banking organizations to make capital distributions in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, although banking organizations were permitted to pay common stock dividends at previous levels provided such distributions did not exceed an amount determined by a formula based on the banking organization's recent income. As a result, CCAR banking organizations, including us, were not permitted to return capital to shareholders in the form of common share repurchases during the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2020.\nState Street Corporation | 120\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOn August 10, 2020, the Federal Reserve confirmed that our SCB is 2.5% for the period starting on October 1, 2020 and ending on September 30, 2021.\nOn October 20, 2020, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking agencies issued a final rule that will require us and State Street Bank to make certain deductions from regulatory capital for investments in certain unsecured debt instruments, including eligible LTD under the TLAC rule, issued by the Parent Company and other U.S. and foreign G-SIBs. The final rule will become effective on April 1, 2021.\nOn December 18, 2020, following the release of a second round of stress test results for 2020, the Federal Reserve decided to modify the applicable restrictions on capital distributions for the first quarter of 2021. Provided that we do not increase the amount of our common stock dividends to be larger than the level paid in the second quarter of 2020, common stock dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter of 2021 will be limited to the average of our net income for the four preceding quarters plus a number of shares equal to the share issuances in the quarter related to expensed employee compensation. We also may redeem and make scheduled payments on additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments in the first quarter of 2021. As of now, our capital distributions in the first quarter of 2021 and beyond will be governed by our minimum capital requirements inclusive of the SCB that will not be recalibrated based on the stress test results.\nFor additional information about regulatory developments, refer to the \"Regulatory Capital Adequacy and Liquidity Standards\" section of \"Supervision and Regulation\" in Business in this Form 10-K.\nCapital Actions\nPreferred Stock\nThe following table summarizes selected terms of each of the series of the preferred stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2020:\n(1)\nOn the redemption date, or any dividend payment date thereafter, the preferred stock and corresponding depositary shares may be redeemed by us, in whole or in part, at the liquidation price per share and liquidation price per depositary share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends.\n(2)\nThe preferred stock and corresponding depositary shares may be redeemed at our option in whole, but not in part, prior to the redemption date upon the occurrence of a regulatory capital treatment event, as defined in the certificate of designation, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation price per share and liquidation price per depositary share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends.\n(3)\nSeries F preferred stock is redeemable on September 15, 2020 and on each succeeding dividend payment date. We did not elect redemption on September 15, 2020 or December 15, 2020.\nState Street Corporation | 121\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe redeemed all outstanding Series C non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock on March 15, 2020 at a redemption price of $500 million ($100,000 per share equivalent to $25.00 per depositary share) plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The difference of $9 million between the redemption value and the net carrying value resulted in an EPS impact of approximately ($0.03) per share in the first quarter of 2020.\nOn January 14, 2021, we announced that we will redeem on March 15, 2021 an aggregate of $500 million, or 5,000 of the 7,500 outstanding shares of our non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series F, for cash at a  redemption price of $100,000 per share (equivalent to $1,000 per depositary share) plus all declared and unpaid dividends. A cash dividend of $953.38 per share of Series F Preferred Stock (or approximately $9.5338 per depositary share) has been declared for the period from December 15, 2020 up to but not including March 15, 2021 (the “March Dividend”). The March Dividend will be paid separately to the holders of record of the Series F Preferred Stock as of March 1, 2021 in the customary manner. Accordingly, there will not be any declared and unpaid dividends included in the Redemption Price.\nThe following tables present the dividends declared for each of the series of preferred stock issued and outstanding for the periods indicated:\nCommon Stock\nIn June 2019, the Federal Reserve issued a non-objection to our capital plan submitted as part of the 2019 CCAR submission; and in connection with that capital plan, our Board approved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $2.0 billion of our common stock from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 (the 2019 Program). We repurchased $500 million of our common stock in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 under the 2019 Program. On March 16, 2020, we, along with the other U.S. G-SIBs, suspended common share repurchases and maintained this suspension through the fourth quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This suspension was consistent with limitations imposed by the Federal Reserve beginning in the second quarter of 2020. As a result, we had no repurchases of our common stock in the second, third or fourth quarters of 2020. In December 2020, the Federal Reserve issued results of 2020 resubmission stress tests and authorized us to continue to pay common stock dividends at current levels and to resume repurchasing common shares in the first quarter of 2021. In January 2021, our Board authorized a common share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $475 million of our common stock through March 31, 2021.\nIn June 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a conditional non-objection to our 2018 capital plan; and in connection with that capital plan, our Board approved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1.2 billion of our common stock through June 30, 2019 (the 2018 Program), under which we repurchased $300 million of our common stock in each of the first and second quarters of 2019.\nThe table below presents the activity under our common stock purchase program for the period indicated:\nState Street Corporation | 122\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe table below presents the dividends declared on common stock for the periods indicated:\nFederal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company. In addition, banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends. For information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks, refer to \"Related Stockholder Matters\" included under Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, and to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. Our common stock and preferred stock dividends, including the declaration, timing and amount thereof, are subject to consideration and approval by the Board at the relevant times.\nStock purchases may be made using various types of mechanisms, including open market purchases, accelerated share repurchases or transactions off market and may be made under Rule 10b5-1 trading programs. The timing of stock purchases, types of transactions and number of shares purchased will depend on several factors, including, market conditions and our capital positions, financial performance and investment opportunities. The common stock purchase program does not have specific price targets and may be suspended at any time.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nOn behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program, we lend securities to banks, broker/dealers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. Though these transactions are collateralized, the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit-based underwriting and monitoring processes. The aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled $440.88 billion and $367.90 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. We require the borrower to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. We hold the collateral received in connection with these securities lending services as agent, and the collateral is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition.\nWe revalue the securities on loan and the collateral daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the borrower. We held, as agent, cash and securities totaling $463.27 billion and $385.43 billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nThe cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. Of the collateral of $463.27 billion and $385.43 billion, referenced above, $54.43 billion and $45.66 billion was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. We or our agents held $58.09 billion and $48.89 billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\nAdditional information about our securities finance activities and other off-balance sheet arrangements is provided in Notes 10, 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. Additional information on our significant accounting policies, including references to applicable footnotes, is provided in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nCertain of our accounting policies, by their nature, require management to make judgments, involving significant estimates and assumptions, about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements.\nBased on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and\nState Street Corporation | 123\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nassumptions, the more significant accounting policies applied by us have been identified by management as those associated with recurring fair value measurements, allowance for credit losses, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, and contingencies. These accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments, and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. An understanding of the judgments, estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nThe following is a discussion of the above-mentioned significant accounting estimates. Management has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the E&A Committee of the Board.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, including trading account assets and liabilities, AFS debt securities, certain equity securities and various types of derivative financial instruments.\nChanges in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in our consolidated statement of condition. In addition to those financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, we estimate the fair values of other financial assets and liabilities that we carry at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition, and we disclose these fair value estimates in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We estimate the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below. Additional information with respect to the assets and liabilities carried by us at fair value on a recurring basis is provided in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nU.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. When we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities, we consider the principal or the most advantageous market in which we would transact; we also consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When possible, we look to active and\nobservable markets to measure the fair value of identical, or similar, financial assets and liabilities. When identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, we look to market-observable data for similar assets and liabilities. In some instances, certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets; as a result, we use alternate valuation techniques to measure their fair value.\nWe categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis based on U.S. GAAP's prescribed three-level valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs (level 3).\nWith respect to derivative instruments, we evaluate the fair value impact of the credit risk of our counterparties. We consider such factors as the market-based probability of default by our counterparties, and our current and expected potential future net exposures by remaining maturities, in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nIn January 2020, we adopted ASC 326, which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology. We maintain an allowance for credit losses to support our on-balance sheet credit exposures, including financial assets held at amortized cost. We also maintain an allowance for unfunded commitments and letters of credit to support our off-balance credit exposure. The two components together represent the allowance for credit losses.\nDetermining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods. We estimate credit losses over the contractual life of the financial asset while factoring in prepayment activity where supported by data over a three year reasonable and supportable forecast period. We utilize a baseline, upside and downside scenario which are applied based on a probability weighting, in order to better reflect management’s expectation of expected credit losses given existing market conditions and the changes in the economic environment. The multiple scenarios are based on a three year horizon (or less depending on contractual maturity) and then revert linearly over a two year period to a ten-year historical average thereafter. The contractual term excludes expected extensions,\nState Street Corporation | 124\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nrenewals and modifications, but includes prepayment assumptions where applicable.\nAdditional information about our allowance for credit losses is provided in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired at the acquisition date. Other intangible assets represent purchased long-lived intangible assets, primarily client relationships, core deposit intangible assets and technology that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Other intangible assets are initially measured  at their acquisition date fair value, the determination of which requires management judgment. Goodwill is not amortized, while other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nManagement reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances arise or events occur that indicate an impairment of the carrying amount may exist. We begin our review by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Events that may indicate impairment include: significant or adverse changes in the business, economic or political climate; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; unanticipated competition; and a more-likely-than-not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate. If we conclude from the qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is greater than its carrying amount, quantitative tests are not required. However, if we determine it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we complete a quantitative assessment to determine if there is goodwill impairment. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and complete a quantitative assessment in any given year.\nIn 2020, we assessed goodwill for impairment using a qualitative assessment. Based on our evaluation of the qualitative factors noted above, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying amount. We determined there was no goodwill impairment in 2020.\nOther intangible assets are supported by the future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the intangible asset, less any costs associated with the\nintangible asset’s eventual disposition. We evaluate other intangible assets for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other groups of assets using the following process.  First, we routinely assess whether impairment indicators are present. When impairment indicators are identified as being present, we compare the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows of the intangible asset with its carrying value.  If the future net undiscounted cash flows are greater than the carrying value, then there is no impairment, but if the intangible asset's net undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value, we are required to calculate impairment. An impairment is recognized by writing the intangible asset down to its fair value.  We evaluate intangible assets for indicators of impairment on a quarterly basis. There were no impairments taken on other intangible assets in 2020.\nAdditional information about goodwill and other intangible assets, including information by line of business, is provided in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nContingencies\nInformation on significant estimates and judgments related with establishing litigation reserves is discussed in Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS\nInformation with respect to recent accounting developments is provided in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K."

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nState Street Corporation | 126\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

State Street Corporation, the Parent Company, is a financial holding company headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in these notes to consolidated financial statements to “State Street,” “we,” “us,” “our” or similar references mean State Street Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, including our principal banking subsidiary, State Street Bank.\nWe have\ntwo\nlines of business:\nInvestment Servicing\nprovides a suite of related products and services including: custody; product accounting; daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; depotbank services (a fund oversight role created by non-U.S. regulation); record-keeping; cash management; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance and enhanced custody products; deposit and short-term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance analytics; and financial data management to support institutional investors.\nIncluded within our Investment Servicing line of business is CRD, which we acquired in October 2018. The Charles River Investment Management solution is a technology offering which is designed to automate and simplify the institutional investment process across asset classes, from portfolio management and risk analytics through trading and post-trade settlement, with integrated compliance and managed data throughout. With the acquisition of CRD, we took the first step in building our front-to-back platform, State Street Alpha. Today our State Street Alpha platform combines portfolio management, trading and execution, advanced data aggregation, analytics and compliance tools, and integration with other industry platforms and providers.\nInvestment Management\n, through State Street Global Advisors, provides a broad range of investment management strategies and products for our clients. Our investment management strategies and products span the risk/reward spectrum for equity, fixed income and cash assets, including core and enhanced indexing, multi-asset strategies, active quantitative and fundamental active capabilities and alternative investment strategies. Our AUM is currently primarily weighted to indexed strategies. In addition, we provide a breadth of services and solutions, including environmental, social and\ngovernance investing, defined benefit and defined contribution and Global Fiduciary Solutions (formerly Outsourced Chief Investment Officer). State Street Global Advisors is also a provider of ETFs, including the SPDR\n®\nETF brand. While management fees are primarily determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees.\nConsolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent Company and its majority- and wholly-owned and otherwise controlled subsidiaries, including State Street Bank. All material inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to current-year presentation.\nWe consolidate subsidiaries in which we exercise control. Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, recorded in other assets, generally are accounted for under the equity method of accounting if we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of the investee. For investments accounted for under the equity method, our share of income or loss is recorded in software and processing fees in our consolidated statement of income. Investments not meeting the criteria for equity-method treatment are measured at fair value through earnings, except for investments where a fair market value is not readily available, which are accounted for under the cost method of accounting.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain of our significant accounting policies that may materially affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses. As a result of unanticipated events or circumstances, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe assets and liabilities of our operations with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated at month-end exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated at rates that approximate average monthly exchange rates. Gains or losses from the translation of the net assets of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, net of related taxes, are recorded in AOCI, a component of shareholders’ equity.\nState Street Corporation | 133\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nFor purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and due from banks.\nInterest-Bearing Deposits with Banks\nInterest-bearing deposits with banks generally consist of highly liquid, short-term investments maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank and other non-U.S. central banks with original maturities at the time of purchase of one month or less.\nSecurities Purchased Under Resale Agreements and Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements and sold under repurchase agreements are treated as collateralized financing transactions, and are recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at the amounts at which the securities will be subsequently resold or repurchased, plus accrued interest. Our policy is to take possession or control of securities underlying resale agreements either directly or through agent banks, allowing borrowers the right of collateral substitution and/or short-notice termination. We revalue these securities daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary from the borrower to protect us against credit exposure. We can use these securities as collateral for repurchase agreements.\nFor securities sold under repurchase agreements collateralized by our investment securities portfolio, the dollar value of the securities remains in investment securities in our consolidated statement of condition. Where a master netting agreement exists or both parties are members of a common clearing organization, resale and repurchase agreements with the same counterparty or clearing house and maturity date are recorded on a net basis.\nFee and Net Interest Income\nThe majority of fees from investment servicing, investment management, securities finance, trading services and certain types of software and processing fees are recorded in our consolidated statement of income based on the consideration specified in contracts with our customers, and excludes taxes collected from customers subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. We recognize revenue as the services are performed or at a point in time depending on the nature of the services provided. Payments made to third party service providers are generally recognized on a gross basis when we control those services and are deemed to be the principal. Additional information about revenue from contracts with customers is provided in Note 25.\nInterest income on interest-earning assets and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities are\nrecorded in our consolidated statement of income as components of NII, and are generally based on the effective yield of the related financial asset or liability.\nOther Significant Policies\nThe following table identifies our other significant accounting policies and the note and page where a detailed description of each policy can be found:\nState Street Corporation | 134\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRecent Accounting Developments\nRelevant standards that were adopted in 2020:\nIn January 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as CECL methodology. This standard requires immediate recognition of expected credit losses for certain financial assets and off-balance sheet commitments, including trade and other receivables, loans and commitments, held-to-maturity debt securities, and other financial assets held at amortized cost at the reporting date, to be measured based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Credit losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded as an allowance against the amortized cost basis of the security, limited to the amount by which the security’s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value, and reversal of impairment losses are allowed when the credit of the issuer improves.\nASC 326 was adopted using a modified retrospective method of transition for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and off balance sheet commitments, which requires the impact of applying the standard on prior periods to be reflected in opening retained earnings upon adoption. Results for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020 are presented under the CECL methodology in ASC 326, while prior period amounts are reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP. The impact of transitioning to ASC 326 on the consolidated financial statements was an increase in the allowance for credit losses and a decrease in retained earnings of $\n3\nmillion primarily arising from:\n• An increase of $\n1\nmillion in the allowance for credit losses related to loans and other financial assets held at amortized cost.\n• An increase of $\n2\nmillion in the allowance for credit losses related to off-balance sheet commitments.\nIn January 2020, we adopted the remaining provisions of ASU 2018-13 - Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework- Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value, specifically the provisions of the standard that add disclosures. We previously adopted the provisions of the standard that eliminated or amended disclosures as of December 31, 2018. There were no material impacts to the disclosures as a result of the adoption.\nIn January 2020, we adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. There were no material impacts to our financial statements as a result of the adoption.\nIn January 2020, we adopted ASU 2018-15, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. There were no material impacts to our financial statements as a result of the adoption.\nASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting is effective as of March 12, 2020. The guidance provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the existing guidance in U.S. GAAP on contract modifications and hedge accounting in relation to the transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance also allows a one-time election to sell and/or reclassify to AFS or trading HTM debt securities that reference an interest rate affected by reference rate reform. We expect to elect certain of the optional expedients and are evaluating the one-time election to sell/transfer HTM securities impacted by reference rate reform.\nWe continue to evaluate accounting standards that were recently issued but not yet adopted as of December 31, 2020, but none are expected to have a material impact to our financial statements.\nNote 2.\nFair Value\nFair Value Measurements\nWe carry trading account assets and liabilities, AFS debt securities, certain equity securities and various types of derivative financial instruments, at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis. Changes in the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income or as components of AOCI within shareholders' equity in our consolidated statement of condition.\nWe measure fair value for the above-described financial assets and liabilities in conformity with U.S. GAAP that governs the measurement of the fair value of financial instruments. Management believes that its valuation techniques and underlying assumptions used to measure fair value conform to the provisions of U.S. GAAP. We categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value based on a prescribed three-level valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). If the inputs used to measure a financial asset or liability cross different levels of the hierarchy, categorization is based on the lowest-level input that is significant to the fair-value measurement. Management's assessment of the significance of a particular input to\nState Street Corporation | 135\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nthe overall fair-value measurement of a financial asset or liability requires judgment, and considers factors specific to that asset or liability. The three levels of the valuation hierarchy are described below.\nLevel 1. Financial assets and liabilities with values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market.\nOur level 1 financial assets and liabilities primarily include positions in U.S. government securities and highly liquid U.S. and non-U.S. government fixed-income securities. Our level 1 financial assets also include actively traded exchange- traded equity securities.\nLevel 2. Financial assets and liabilities with values based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 2 inputs include the following:\n▪\nQuoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;\n▪\nQuoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets;\n▪\nPricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and\n▪\nPricing  models  whose  inputs  are  derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market information through correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nOur level 2 financial assets and liabilities primarily include non-U.S. debt securities carried in trading account assets and various types of fixed-income AFS investment securities, as well as various types of foreign exchange and interest rate derivative instruments.\nFair value for our AFS investment securities categorized in level 2 is measured primarily using information obtained from independent third parties. This third-party information is subject to review by management as part of a validation process, which includes obtaining an understanding of the underlying assumptions and the level of market participant information used to support those assumptions. In addition, management compares significant assumptions used by third parties to available market information. Such information may include known trades or, to the extent that trading activity is limited, comparisons to market research information pertaining to credit expectations, execution prices and the timing of cash flows and, where information is available, back- testing.\nDerivative instruments categorized in level 2 predominantly represent foreign exchange contracts\nused in our trading activities, for which fair value is measured using discounted cash-flow techniques, with inputs consisting of observable spot and forward points, as well as observable interest rate curves. With respect to derivative instruments, we evaluate the impact on valuation of the credit risk of our counterparties. We consider factors such as the likelihood of default by our counterparties, our current and potential future net exposures and remaining maturities in determining the fair value. Valuation adjustments associated with derivative instruments were not material to those instruments for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nLevel 3. Financial assets and liabilities with values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable in the market and significant to the overall measurement of fair value.\nThese inputs reflect management's judgment about the assumptions that a market participant would use in pricing the financial asset or liability, and are based on the best available information, some of which may be internally developed. The following provides a more detailed discussion of our financial assets and liabilities that we may categorize in level 3 and the related valuation methodology.\n•\nThe  fair  value  of  our  investment  securities categorized  in  level  3  is  measured  using information obtained from third-party sources, typically non-binding broker/dealer quotes, or through the use of internally-developed pricing models. Management has evaluated its methodologies used to measure fair value and has considered the level of observable market information to be insufficient to categorize the securities in level 2.\n•\nThe fair value of certain foreign exchange contracts, primarily options, is measured using an option-pricing model. Because of a limited number of observable transactions, certain model inputs are not observable, such as implied volatility surface, but are derived from observable market information.\nOur level 3 financial assets and liabilities are similar in structure and profile to our level 1 and level 2 financial instruments, but they trade in less liquid markets, and the measurement of their fair value is inherently less observable.\nThe following tables present information with respect to our financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis as of the dates indicated:\nState Street Corporation | 136\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(1)\nRepresents counterparty netting against level 2 financial assets and liabilities where a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between us and the counterparty. Netting also reflects asset and liability reductions of $\n5.87\nbillion  and $\n1.29\nbillion, respectively, for cash collateral received from and provided to derivative counterparties.\n(2)\nAs of December 31, 2020, the fair value of other non-U.S. debt securities included $\n9.55\nbillion of supranational and non-U.S. agency bonds, $\n1.88\nbillion of corporate bonds and $\n0.47\nbillion of covered bonds.\nState Street Corporation | 137\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(1)\nRepresents counterparty netting against level 2 financial assets and liabilities where a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between us and the counterparty. Netting also reflects asset and liability reductions of $\n2.31\nbillion and $\n0.84\nbillion, respectively, for cash collateral received from and provided to derivative counterparties.\n(2)\nAs of December 31, 2019, the fair value of other non-U.S. debt securities included $\n5.50\nbillion of supranational and non-U.S. agency bonds, $\n1.78\nbillion of corporate bonds and $\n0.68\nbillion of covered bonds.\nState Street Corporation | 138\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following tables present activity related to our level 3 financial assets during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Transfers into and out of level 3 are reported as of the beginning of the period presented. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, transfers into level 3 were primarily related to collateralized loan obligations, for which fair value was measured using information obtained from third party sources, including non-binding broker/dealer quotes. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, transfers out of level 3 were mainly related to collateralized loan obligations, certain MBS and non-U.S. debt securities, for which fair value was measured using prices based on observable market information.\n(1)\nTotal realized and unrealized gains (losses) on AFS investment securities are included within gains (losses) related to investment securities, net. Total realized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments are included within foreign exchange trading services.\nState Street Corporation | 139\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(1)\nTotal realized and unrealized gains (losses) on AFS investment securities are included within gains (losses) related to investment securities, net. Total realized and unrealized gains (losses) on derivative instruments are included within foreign exchange trading services.\nThe following table presents quantitative information, as of the dates indicated, about the valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of our level 3 financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for which we use internally-developed pricing models. The significant unobservable inputs for our level 3 financial assets and liabilities whose fair value is measured using pricing information from non-binding broker/dealer quotes are not included in the table, as the specific inputs applied are not provided by the broker/dealer.\n(1)\nSignificant changes in these unobservable inputs may result in significant changes in fair value measurement of the derivative instrument.\nState Street Corporation | 140\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFinancial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value\nEstimates of fair value for financial instruments not carried at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition are generally subjective in nature, and are determined as of a specific point in time based on the characteristics of the financial instruments and relevant market information. Disclosure of fair value estimates is not required by U.S. GAAP for certain items, such as lease financing, equity- method investments, obligations for pension and other post-retirement plans, premises and equipment, other intangible assets and income-tax assets and liabilities. Accordingly, aggregate fair-value estimates presented do not purport  to  represent,  and  should  not  be considered representative of, our underlying “market” or franchise value. In addition, because of potential differences in methodologies and assumptions used to estimate fair values, our estimates of fair value should not be compared to those of other financial institutions.\nWe use the following methods to estimate the fair values of our financial instruments:\n•\nFor financial instruments that have quoted market prices, those quoted prices are used to estimate fair value;\n•\nFor financial instruments that have no defined maturity, have a remaining maturity of 180 days or less, or reprice frequently to a market rate, we assume that the fair value of these instruments approximates their reported value, after taking into consideration any applicable credit risk; and\n•\nFor financial instruments for which no quoted market prices are available, fair value is estimated using information obtained from independent third parties, or by discounting the expected cash flows using an estimated current market interest rate for the financial instrument.\nThe generally short duration of certain of our assets and liabilities results in a significant number of financial instruments for which fair value equals or closely approximates the amount recorded in our consolidated statement of condition. These financial instruments are reported in the following captions in our consolidated statement of condition: cash and due from banks; interest-bearing deposits with banks; securities purchased under resale agreements; accrued interest and fees receivable; deposits; securities sold under repurchase agreements; and other short-term borrowings.\nIn addition, due to the relatively short duration of certain of our loans, we consider fair value for these loans to approximate their reported value. The fair value of other types of loans, such as leveraged loans, commercial real estate loans, purchased receivables and municipal loans is estimated using information obtained from independent third parties or by discounting expected future cash flows using current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities. Commitments to lend have no reported value because their terms are at prevailing market rates.\nState Street Corporation | 141\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following tables present the reported amounts and estimated fair values of the financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value, as they would be categorized within the fair value hierarchy, as of the dates indicated:\n(1)\nRepresents a portion of underlying client assets related to our enhanced custody business, which clients have allowed us to transfer and re-pledge.\n(1)\nIncludes $\n9\nmillion of loans classified as held-for-sale that were measured at fair value as of December 31, 2019.\n(2)\nRepresents a portion of underlying client assets related to our enhanced custody business, which clients have allowed us to transfer and re-pledge.\nState Street Corporation | 142\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 3.\nInvestment Securities\nInvestment securities held by us are classified as either trading account assets, AFS, HTM or equity securities held at fair value at the time of purchase and reassessed periodically, based on management’s intent.\nGenerally, trading assets are debt and equity securities purchased in connection with our trading activities and, as such, are expected to be sold in the near term. Our trading activities typically involve active and frequent buying and selling with the objective of generating profits on short-term movements. AFS investment securities are those securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time. AFS investment securities include securities utilized as part of our asset and liability management activities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment risk, liquidity needs or other factors. HTM securities are debt securities that management has the intent and the ability to hold to maturity.\nStarting in the first quarter of 2020, we supported our clients' liquidity needs through the MMLF program, purchasing a total of $\n29\nbillion of investment securities under that program, $\n3.3\nbillion of which remain outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nTrading assets are carried at fair value. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading assets are recorded in foreign exchange trading services revenue in our consolidated statement of income. AFS securities are carried at fair value, with any allowance for credit losses recorded through the consolidated statement of income and after-tax net unrealized gains and losses are recorded in AOCI. Gains or losses realized on sales of AFS investment securities are computed using the specific identification method and are recorded in gains (losses) related to investment securities, net, in our consolidated statement of income. HTM investment securities are carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, with any allowance for credit losses recorded through the consolidated statement of income. As of December 31, 2020, we recognized an allowance for credit losses on HTM investment securities of $\n3\nmillion.\nPrior to adoption of ASC 326 in 2020, AFS securities were carried at fair value, and after-tax net unrealized gains and losses were recorded in AOCI.\nHTM investment securities were carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts.\nState Street Corporation | 143\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents the amortized cost, fair value and associated unrealized gains and losses of AFS and HTM investment securities as of the dates indicated:\n(1)\nPrimarily comprised of securities guaranteed by the federal government with respect to at least\n97\n% of defaulted principal and accrued interest on the underlying loans.\n(2)\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the fair value of other non-U.S. debt securities included $\n9.55\nbillion and $\n5.50\nbillion, respectively, primarily of supranational and non-U.S. agency bonds, $\n1.88\nbillion and $\n1.78\nbillion, respectively, of corporate bonds and $\n0.47\nbillion and $\n0.68\nbillion, respectively, of covered bonds.\n(3)\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the fair value of state and political subdivisions includes securities in trusts of $\n0.70\nbillion and $\n0.94\nbillion, respectively. Additional information about these trusts is provided in Note 14.\n(4)\nAn immaterial amount of accrued interest related to HTM and AFS investment securities was excluded from the amortized cost basis for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(5)\nAs of December 31, 2020, we recognized an allowance for credit losses of $\n3\nmillion on all HTM securities.\nState Street Corporation | 144\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAggregate investment securities with carrying values of approximately $\n70.57\nbillion and $\n49.48\nbillion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, were designated as pledged for public and trust deposits, short-term borrowings and for other purposes as provided by law.\nIn 2020, 2019 and 2018, $\n8.60\nbillion, $\n3.98\nbillion and $\n2.13\nmillion, respectively, of agency MBS, previously classified as AFS, were transferred to HTM. These transfers reflect our intent to hold these securities until their maturity. These securities were transferred at fair value, which included a net unrealized gain of $\n120\nmillion and $\n49\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a net unrealized loss of $\n53\nmillion as of December 31, 2018, within accumulated other comprehensive loss which will be accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the transferred security (ranging from approximately\n3\nto\n37\nyears).\nIn 2018, $\n1.22\nbillion of HTM securities, primarily consisting of MBS and CMBS, were transferred to AFS at book value and sold at a pre-tax loss of approximately $\n36\nmillion, due to our election to make a one-time transfer of securities relating to the adoption of ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.\nIn 2020, 2019 and 2018, we sold approximately $\n2.65\nbillion, $\n5.64\nbillion and $\n26.37\nbillion, respectively, of AFS securities, primarily ABS and municipal bonds, resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $\n4\nmillion in 2020, a pre-tax loss less than $\n1\nmillion in 2019 and a pre-tax gain of $\n9\nmillion in 2018.\nThe following table presents the aggregate fair values of AFS investment securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, and those that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer, as of the dates indicated:\nState Street Corporation | 145\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents the aggregate fair values of AFS and HTM investment securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months, and those that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer, as of the dates indicated:\nState Street Corporation | 146\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents the amortized cost and the fair value of contractual maturities of debt investment securities as of December 31, 2020. The maturities of certain ABS, MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are based on expected principal payments. Actual maturities may differ from these expected maturities since certain borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.\nState Street Corporation | 147\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following tables present gross realized gains and losses from sales of AFS investment securities, and the components of net impairment losses included in net gains and losses related to investment securities for the periods indicated, recognized under previous accounting guidance prior to the adoption of ASC 326:\nInterest income related to debt securities is recognized in our consolidated statement of income using the effective interest method, or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the contractual or estimated life of the security. The level rate of return considers any non-refundable fees or costs, as well as purchase premiums or discounts, adjusted as prepayments occur, resulting in amortization or accretion, accordingly.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Debt Securities and Impairment of AFS Securities\nAs discussed in Note 1, we adopted ASC 326 on January 1, 2020. We conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether an allowance for credit losses is required. HTM securities are evaluated for expected credit loss utilizing a probability of default methodology, or discounted cash flows assessed against the amortized cost of the investment security excluding accrued interest. An AFS security is impaired when the current fair value of an individual security is below its amortized cost basis. An allowance for credit losses on impaired AFS securities is recorded when the present value of expected future cash flows of the investment security is less than its amortized cost basis, limited to the amount by which the security’s amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value. Investment securities will be written down to fair value through the consolidated statement of income when management intends to sell (or may be required to sell) the securities before they recover in value.\nWe monitor the credit quality of the HTM and AFS investment securities using a variety of methods, including both external and internal credit ratings. As\nof December 31, 2020,\n99\n% of our HTM and AFS investment portfolio is publicly rated investment grade.\nOur allowance for credit losses on our HTM securities is approximately $\n3\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and we recorded a $\n3\nmillion provision and\nno\ncharge-offs on HTM securities in 2020.\nOur review of impaired AFS investment securities generally includes:\n• the identification and evaluation of securities that have indications of potential impairment, such as issuer-specific concerns, including deteriorating financial condition or bankruptcy;\n•\nthe analysis of expected future cash flows of securities, based on quantitative and qualitative factors;\n• the analysis of the collectability of those future cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts;\n• the analysis of the underlying collateral for MBS and ABS;\n• the analysis of individual impaired securities, including the anticipated recovery period and the magnitude of the overall price decline;\n• evaluation of factors or triggers that could cause individual securities to be deemed impaired and those that would not support impairment; and\n• documentation of the results of these analyses.\nSubstantially all of our investment securities portfolio is composed of debt securities. A critical component of our assessment of impairment of these debt securities is the identification of credit-impaired securities for which management does not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.\nDebt securities that are not deemed to be credit impaired are subject to additional management analysis to assess whether management intends to sell, or, more likely than not, would be required to sell, the security before the expected recovery of its amortized cost basis.\nWith respect to certain classes of debt securities, primarily U.S. Treasuries and agency securities (mainly issued by U.S. Government entities and agencies, as well as Group of Seven sovereigns), we consider the history of credit losses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, which may indicate that the expectation that nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is or continues to be zero. Therefore, for those securities, we do not record expected credit losses.\nState Street Corporation | 148\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWe have elected to not record an allowance on accrued interest for HTM and AFS securities. Accrued Interest on these securities is reversed against interest income when payment on a security is delinquent for greater than 90 days from the date of payment.\nAfter a review of the investment portfolio, taking into consideration then-current economic conditions, adverse situations that might affect our ability to fully collect principal and interest, the timing of future payments, the credit quality and performance of the collateral underlying MBS and ABS and other relevant factors, management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the investment securities portfolio and the resulting gross pre-tax unrealized losses of $\n123\nmillion related to\n503\nsecurities as of December 31, 2020 to not be the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities.\nPrior to the adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, we assessed our AFS and HTM securities for impairment under an OTTI model.\nUnder this model impairment of AFS and HTM debt securities was recorded in our consolidated statement of income when management intended to sell (or may be required to sell) the securities before they recovered in value, or when management expected the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the securities to be less than the amortized cost of the impaired security (a credit loss). The review of impaired securities under the OTTI model was consistent with the considerations noted for AFS securities under ASC 326. Where impairment was indicated based on our review, the following factors were also considered in determining whether impairment was other than temporary:\n•\ncertain macroeconomic drivers;\n•\ncertain industry-specific drivers;\n•\nthe length of time the security has been impaired;\n•\nthe severity of the impairment;\n•\nthe cause of the impairment and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer;\n•\nactivity in the market with respect to the issuer's securities, which may indicate adverse credit conditions; and\n•\nour intention not to sell, and the likelihood that we will not be required to sell, the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for its recovery in value.\nSubstantially all of our investment securities portfolio is composed of debt securities. A critical\ncomponent of our assessment of OTTI of these debt securities was the identification of credit-impaired securities for which management did not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Debt securities that were not deemed to be credit-impaired were subject to additional management analysis to assess whether management intended to sell, or, more likely than not, would be required to sell, the security before the expected recovery of its amortized cost basis.\nWe recorded less than $1 million and $\n3\nmillion of OTTI, included in other income, in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which resulted from adverse changes in the timing of expected future cash flows from non-U.S. mortgage- and asset backed securities.\nThe following table presents a roll-forward with respect to net impairment losses that had been recognized in income for the periods indicated:\n1)\nAdditions represent securities with a first time credit impairment realized or when a subsequent credit impairment has occurred.\n(2)\nDeductions represent impairments on securities that have been sold or matured, are required to be sold, or for which management intends to sell.\nAfter a review of the investment portfolio, taking into consideration then-current economic conditions, adverse situations that might affect our ability to fully collect principal and interest, the timing of future payments, the credit quality and performance of the collateral underlying MBS and ABS and other relevant factors, management considered the aggregate decline in fair value of the investment securities portfolio and the resulting gross pre-tax unrealized losses of $\n123\nmillion and $\n169\nmillion related to\n503\nand\n622\nsecurities as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, to be temporary, and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities.\nNote 4.\nLoans and Allowance for Credit Losses\nLoans are generally recorded at their principal amount outstanding, net of the allowance for credit losses, unearned income, and any net unamortized deferred loan origination fees. Loans that are classified as held-for-sale are measured at lower of cost or fair value on an individual basis.\nInterest income related to loans is recognized in our consolidated statement of income using the interest method, or on a basis approximating a level\nState Street Corporation | 149\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nrate of return over the term of the loan. Fees received for providing loan commitments and letters of credit that we anticipate will result in loans typically are deferred and amortized to interest income over the term of the related loan, beginning with the initial borrowing. Fees on commitments and letters of credit are amortized to software and processing fees over the commitment period when funding is not known or expected.\nThe following table presents our recorded investment in loans, by segment, as of the dates indicated:\n(1)\nDomestic and foreign categorization is based on the borrower’s country of domicile.\n(2)\nFund finance loans include primarily $\n6,391\nmillion loans to real money funds, $\n8,380\nmillion private equity capital call finance loans and $\n821\nmillion loans to business development companies as of December 31, 2020, compared to $\n6,040\nmillion loans to real money funds, $\n6,076\nmillion private equity capital call finance loans and $\n932\nmillion loans to business development companies as of December 31, 2019.\n(3)\nIncludes $\n1,911\nmillion securities finance loans, $\n754\nmillion loans to municipalities and $\n54\nmillion other loans as of December 31, 2020 and $\n2,537\nmillion securities finance loans, $\n848\nmillion loans to municipalities and $\n26\nmillion other loans as of December 31, 2019.\nWe segregate our loans into\ntwo\nsegments: commercial and financial loans and commercial real estate loans. These classifications reflect their risk characteristics, their initial measurement attributes and the methods we use to monitor and assess credit risk.\nThe commercial and financial segment is composed of primarily floating-rate loans, purchased leveraged loans, overdrafts and other loans. Fund finance loans are composed of revolving credit lines providing liquidity and leverage to mutual fund and private equity fund clients.\nCertain loans are pledged as collateral for access to the Federal Reserve's discount window. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the loans pledged as collateral totaled $\n8.07\nbillion and $\n6.75\nbillion, respectively.\nWe generally place loans on non-accrual status once principal or interest payments are 90 days contractually past due, or earlier if management determines that full collection is not probable. Loans 90 days past due, but considered both well-secured and in the process of collection, may be excluded from non-accrual status. When we place a loan on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest is discontinued and previously recorded but unpaid interest is reversed and generally charged against interest income. For loans on non-accrual status, income is recognized on a cash basis after recovery of principal, if and when interest payments are received. Loans may be removed from non-accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and performance under the terms of the loan has been demonstrated. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had\nno\nloans on non-accrual status. As of December 31, 2020, we had\none\nloan with principal or interest payments 30 days or more contractually past due, that was subsequently paid in January 2021. As of December 31, 2019, we had\nno\nloans with principal or interest payments 30 days or more contractually past due.\nWe sold $\n353\nmillion of leveraged loans in 2020. We recorded a charge-off against the allowance for these loans prior to the sale of these loans of $\n41\nmillion  in 2020.\nIn certain circumstances, we restructure troubled loans by granting concessions to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Once restructured, the loans are generally considered impaired until their maturity, regardless of whether the borrowers perform under the modified terms of the loans. There were\nno\nloans modified in troubled debt restructurings during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe recognize an allowance for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326 for financial assets held at amortized cost and off-balance sheet commitments. Further discussion of our adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, including the impact on our consolidated financial statements, is provided in Note 1. For additional discussion on the allowance for credit losses for investment securities, please refer to Note 3.\nWhen the allowance is recorded, a provision for credit loss expense is recognized in net income. The allowance for credit losses for financial assets (excluding investment securities, as discussed in Note 3) represents the portion of the amortized cost basis, including accrued interest for financial assets\nState Street Corporation | 150\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nheld at amortized cost, which management does not expect to recover due to expected credit losses and is presented on the statement of condition as an offset to the amortized cost basis. The accrued interest balance is presented separately on the statement of condition within accrued interest and fees receivable. The allowance for off-balance sheet commitments is presented within other liabilities. Loans are charged off to the allowance for credit losses in the reporting period in which either an event occurs that confirms the existence of a loss on a loan, including a sale of a loan below its carrying value, or a portion of a loan is determined to be uncollectible.\nThe allowance for credit losses may be determined using various methods, including discounted cash flow methods, loss-rate methods, probability-of-default methods, and other quantitative or qualitative methods as determined by us. The method used to estimate expected credit losses may vary depending on the type of financial asset, our ability to predict the timing of cash flows, and the information available to us.\nThe allowance for credit losses as reported in our consolidated statement of condition is adjusted by provision for credit losses, which is reported in earnings, and reduced by the charge-off of principal amounts, net of recoveries.\nWe measure expected credit losses of financial assets on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristic exist. Each reporting period, we assess whether the assets in the pool continue to display similar risk characteristics.\nFor a financial asset that does not share risk characteristics with other assets, expected credit losses are measured based on the difference between the discounted value of the expected future cash flows, utilizing the effective interest rate and the amortized cost basis of the asset. As of December 31, 2020, we had\n5\nloans for $\n77\nmillion in the commercial and financial segment that no longer met the similar risk characteristics of their collective pool. We recorded an allowance for credit losses of $\n6\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 on these loans.\nWhen the asset is collateral dependent, which means when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, expected credit losses are measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the asset and the fair value of the collateral, adjusted for the estimated costs to sell.\nDetermining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods, factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant\nchanges in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods.\nWe estimate credit losses over the contractual life of the financial asset, while factoring in prepayment activity, where supported by data, over a three year reasonable and supportable forecast period. We utilize a baseline, upside and downside scenario which are applied based on a probability weighting, in order to better reflect management’s expectation of expected credit losses given existing market conditions and the changes in the economic environment. The multiple scenarios are based on a three year horizon (or less depending on contractual maturity) and then revert linearly over a two year period to a ten-year historical average thereafter. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications, but includes prepayment assumptions where applicable.\nAs part of our allowance methodology, we establish qualitative reserves to address any risks inherent in our portfolio that are not addressed through our quantitative reserve assessment. These  factors may relate to, among other things, legislation changes or new regulation, credit concentration, loan markets, scenario weighting and overall model limitations.  The qualitative adjustments are applied to our portfolio of financial instruments under the  existing governance structure and are inherently judgmental.\nPrior to the implementation of ASC 326, we reviewed loans for indicators of impairment. Loans where indicators existed were evaluated individually for impairment at least quarterly. For those loans where no such indicators were identified, the loans were collectively evaluated for impairment. As of December 31, 2019, we had\none\nloan for $\n25\nmillion in the commercial and financial segment that was individually evaluated for impairment and deemed to be impaired. We recorded a specific reserve of $\n1\nmillion for this loan.\nCredit Quality\nCredit quality for financial assets held at amortized cost are continuously monitored by management and is reflected within the allowance for credit losses.\nWe use an internal risk-rating system to assess our risk of credit loss for each loan. This risk-rating process incorporates the use of risk-rating tools in conjunction with management judgment. Qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a systematic manner, and following a formal review and approval process, an internal credit rating based on our credit scale is assigned.\nWhen computing allowance levels, credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes asset pools based on loss history,\nState Street Corporation | 151\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ndelinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. In future periods evaluations of the overall asset portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense in those future periods.\nCredit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes in order to enable the earliest possible detection of any concerns with the customer’s credit rating. The results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and transactions with counterparties and in our process for estimation of expected credit losses.\nIn assessing the risk rating assigned to each individual loan, among the factors considered are the borrower's debt capacity, collateral coverage, payment history and delinquency experience, financial flexibility and earnings strength, the expected amounts and source of repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, if any, and the industry and geography in which the borrower operates. These factors are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, and involve subjective assessment and interpretation. Credit counterparties are evaluated and risk-rated on an individual basis at least annually. Management considers the ratings to be current as of December 31, 2020.\nManagement regularly reviews financial assets in the portfolio to assess credit quality indicators and to determine appropriate loans classification and grading in accordance with applicable bank regulations. Our internal risk rating methodology assigns risk ratings to counterparties ranging from Investment Grade, Speculative, Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful and Loss.\n•\nInvestment Grade. Counterparties with strong credit quality and low expected credit risk and probability of default. Approximately\n81\n% of our loans were rated as investment grade as of December 31, 2020 with external credit ratings, or equivalent, of \"BBB-\" or better.\n•\nSpeculative. Counterparties that have the ability to repay but face significant uncertainties, such as adverse business or financial circumstances that could affect credit risk.  Loans to counterparties rated\nas speculative account for  approximately\n19\n% of our loans as of December 31, 2020, and are concentrated in leveraged loans. Approximately\n85\n% of those leveraged loans have an external credit rating, or equivalent, of \"BB\" or \"B\" as of December 31, 2020.\n•\nSpecial Mention. Counterparties with potential weaknesses that, if uncorrected, may result in deterioration of repayment prospects.\n•\nSubstandard. Counterparties with well-defined weakness that jeopardizes repayment with the possibility we will sustain some loss.\n•\nDoubtful. Counterparties with well-defined weakness which make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable.\n•\nLoss. Counterparties which are uncollectible or have little value.\nThe following tables present our recorded  loans to counterparties by risk rating, as noted above, as of the dates indicated:\n(1)\nLoans Include  $\n2,982\nmillion and $\n3,256\nmillion of overdrafts as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Overdrafts are short-term in nature and do not present a significant credit risk to us.\nFinancial assets held at amortized cost that are not loans are disaggregated based on product type. This includes our fees receivable balance, which have had no history of credit losses, and are evaluated collectively as a pool.\nSecurities purchased under a resale agreement and securities-financing within our principal business utilize the collateral maintenance provisions included within ASC 326. An allowance for credit losses is recognized for any remaining exposure based on counterparty type.\nState Street Corporation | 152\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe allowance for credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures, recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated statement of condition, represents management’s estimate of credit losses primarily in outstanding letters and lines of credit and other credit-enhancement facilities provided to our clients and outstanding as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is evaluated quarterly by management. Factors considered in evaluating the appropriate level of this allowance are similar to those considered with respect to the allowance for credit losses on financial assets held at amortized cost. Provisions to maintain the allowance at a level considered by us to be appropriate to absorb estimated credit losses in outstanding facilities are recorded in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statement of income.\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis, by year of origination and credit quality indicator as of  December 31, 2020. For origination years before the fifth annual period, we present the aggregate amortized cost basis of loans. For purchased loans, the date of issuance is used to determine the year of origination, not the date of acquisition. For modified, extended or renewed lending arrangements, we evaluate whether a credit event has occurred which would consider the loan to be a new arrangement.\n(1)\nAny reserve associated with accrued interest is not material.\nAs of December 31, 2020, accrued interest receivable of $\n72\nmillion included in the amortized cost basis of loans has been excluded from the amortized cost basis within this table.\nThe following table presents the activity in the allowance for credit losses by portfolio and class for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n(1)\nIncludes $\n13\nmillion allowance for credit losses on Fund Finance loans and $\n4\nmillion on other loans.\n(2)\nRelated to the sale of leveraged loans in 2020.\nState Street Corporation | 153\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLoans are reviewed on a regular basis, and any provisions for credit losses that are recorded reflect management's estimate of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered appropriate to absorb estimated credit losses in the loan portfolio. We recorded $\n88\nmillion provision for credit losses in 2020, which reflected both downward credit migration within our loan portfolio and revision in management’s economic outlook reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Allowance estimates remain subject to continued model and economic uncertainty and management may use qualitative  adjustments. If future data and forecasts deviate relative to the forecasts utilized to determine our allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020, or if credit risk migration is higher or lower than forecasted for reasons independent of the economic forecast, our allowance for credit losses will also change.\nAllowance for Loan Losses under Incurred Loss Methodology for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018\nOn-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures\nFactors considered in evaluating the appropriate level of the allowance for each segment of our loan portfolio under the incurred loss model included loss experience, the probability of default reflected in our internal risk rating of the counterparty's creditworthiness, then-current economic conditions and adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, the estimated value of the underlying collateral, if any, the performance of individual credits in relation to contract terms, and other relevant factors.\nLoans were charged off to the allowance for loan losses in the reporting period in which either an event occurred that confirmed the existence of a loss on a loan, including a sale of a loan below its carrying value, or a portion of a loan was determined to be uncollectible. In addition, any impaired loan that was determined to be collateral-dependent was reduced to an amount equal to the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. A loan was identified as collateral-dependent when management determined that it was probable that the underlying collateral would be the sole source of repayment. Recoveries were recorded on a cash basis as adjustments to the allowance.\nThe following table presents activity in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated under the incurred loss methodology:\n(1)\nThe provisions and charge offs for credit losses were primarily attributable to exposure to purchased leveraged loans to non-investment grade loans.\nOff-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures\nThe reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures, recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated statement of condition, represented management’s estimate of probable credit losses primarily in letters and lines of credit and other credit-enhancement facilities provided to our clients and outstanding as of the balance sheet date.\nThe reserve was evaluated on a regular basis by management. Factors considered in evaluating the appropriate level of this reserve were similar to those considered with respect to the allowance for loan losses. Provisions to maintain the reserve at a level considered by us to be appropriate to absorb estimated incurred credit losses in outstanding facilities were recorded in other expenses in our consolidated statement of income.\nNote 5.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent purchased long-lived intangible assets, primarily client relationships, that can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual rights or because the asset can be exchanged on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to at least annual evaluation for impairment. Other intangible assets, which are subject to evaluation for impairment, are mainly related to client relationships, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from\nfive\nto\ntwenty years\n, technology assets, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from\nthree\nto\nten years\n, and core deposit intangible assets, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from\nsixteen\nto\ntwenty-two years\n, with such amortization recorded in other expenses in our consolidated statement of income.\nImpairment of goodwill is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit, including its allocation of goodwill and other intangible assets, exceeds its estimated fair value. Impairment of other\nState Street Corporation | 154\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nintangible assets is deemed to exist if the balance of the other intangible asset exceeds the cumulative expected net cash inflows related to the asset over its remaining estimated useful life. If these reviews determine that goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, the value of the goodwill or the other intangible asset is written down through a charge to other expenses in our consolidated statement of income. There were\nno\nimpairments to goodwill or other intangible assets in 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nThe following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the periods indicated:\n(1)\nInvestment Servicing includes our acquisition of CRD.\n(2)\nWe completed the purchase price accounting for the CRD acquisition as of March 31, 2019. Upon completion of valuation procedures related to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, primarily the identifiable intangible assets, we recorded measurement period adjustments in the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in an increase in the goodwill of $\n113\nmillion and a decrease of $\n93\nmillion in other intangible assets.\nThe following table presents changes in the net carrying amount of other intangible assets during the periods indicated:\n(1)\nInvestment Servicing includes our acquisition of CRD.\n(2)\nWe completed the purchase price accounting for the CRD acquisition as of March 31, 2019. Upon completion of valuation procedures related to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, primarily the identifiable intangible assets, we recorded measurement period adjustments in the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in a decrease in the fair value of other intangible assets of $\n93\nmillion, with a corresponding increase to goodwill.\nThe following table presents the gross carrying amount, accumulated amortization and net carrying amount of other intangible assets by type as of the dates indicated:\nAmortization expense related to other intangible assets was $\n234\nmillion, $\n236\nmillion and $\n226\nmillion in 2020, 2019  and 2018, respectively.\nExpected future amortization expense for other intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2020 is as follows:\nState Street Corporation | 155\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 6.\nOther Assets\nThe following table presents the components of other assets as of the dates indicated:\n(1)\nRefer to Note 11, for further information on the impact of collateral on our financial statement presentation of securities borrowing and securities lending transactions.\n(2)\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities recorded in our consolidated statement of condition are netted within the same tax jurisdiction.\nNote 7.\nDeposits\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $\n1.68\nbillion of time deposits outstanding, all of which were non-US time deposits. As of December 31, 2019, we had $\n35.15\nbillion of time deposits outstanding, of which $\n3.00\nbillion were wholesale CDs, $\n32.01\nbillion were derived from client deposits (payable on demand to such clients) and held in a time deposit established by us as the agent and $\n139\nmillion were non-U.S. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, all U.S. and non-U.S. time deposits were in amounts of $250,000 or more. As of December 31, 2020, all time deposits are scheduled to mature in 2021. Demand deposit overdrafts of $\n2.98\nbillion and $\n3.26\nbillion were included as loan balances at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNote 8.\nShort-Term Borrowings\nOur short-term borrowings include securities sold under repurchase agreements, short-term borrowings associated with our tax-exempt investment program (more fully described in Note 14) and other short-term borrowings, including those related to the money market liquidity facility.\nCollectively, short-term borrowings had weighted-average interest rates of\n0.93\n% and\n1.64\n% in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following table presents information with respect to the amounts outstanding and weighted-average interest rates of the primary components of our short-term borrowings as of and for the years ended December 31:\nnm\nNot meaningful\nObligations to repurchase securities sold are recorded as a liability in our consolidated statement of condition. U.S. government securities with a fair value of $\n3.98\nbillion underlying the repurchase agreements remained in our investment securities portfolio as of December 31, 2020.\nState Street Corporation | 156\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents information about these U.S. government securities and the carrying value of the related repurchase agreements, including accrued interest, as of December 31, 2020.\n(1)\nCollateralized by investment securities.\nWe maintain an agreement with a clearing organization that enables us to net all securities purchased under resale agreements and sold under repurchase agreements with counterparties that are also members of the clearing organization. As a result of this netting, the average balances of securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements were reduced by $\n100.45\nbillion in 2020 compared to $\n86.67\nbillion in 2019. The increase in average balance sheet netting, in 2020 compared to 2019, is primarily due to the expansion of our FICC program and new client activity.\nState Street Bank currently maintains a line of credit of CAD\n1.40\nbillion, or approximately $\n1.10\nbillion, as of December 31, 2020, to support its Canadian securities processing operations. The line of credit has no stated termination date and is cancelable by either party with prior notice. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was\nno\nbalance outstanding on this line of credit.\nNote 9.\nLong-Term Debt\n(1)\nWe have entered into interest rate swap agreements, recorded as fair value hedges, to modify our interest expense on these senior and subordinated notes from a fixed rate to a floating rate. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value of long-term debt associated with these fair value hedges was $\n691\nmillion  and$\n157\nmillion, respectively. Refer to Note 10 for additional information about fair value hedges.\n(2)\nThe subordinated notes qualify for inclusion in tier 2 regulatory capital under current federal regulatory capital guidelines.\n(3)\nWe may not redeem notes prior to their maturity.\nState Street Corporation | 157\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn\nthe\nfourth\nquarter\nof\n2019,\nwe\ncompleted\na\ncash tender\noffer\nfor\napproximately\n$\n297\nmillion\nof\nour\n$\n800\nmillion aggregate principal amount of outstanding floating\nrate\njunior\nsubordinated\ndebentures\ndue\n2047, resulting in a gain of approximately $\n44\nmillion.

Pursuant to the terms of the Replacement Capital Covenant, neither us nor any of our subsidiaries, including State Street Bank, was permitted to repay, redeem or purchase any of the outstanding floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2047 prior to June 1, 2047 unless certain conditions had been satisfied, except to the extent that (i) we obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve, if such approval was then required, and (ii) we had received proceeds, up to specified percentages of the aggregate principal amount repaid or the applicable redemption or purchase price, from the sale or issuance of qualifying securities with characteristics that are the same as, or more equity-like than, the applicable characteristics of the floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2047 during the 180 days prior to the date of that repayment, redemption or purchase (which period was to be shortened under certain specified circumstances). The Replacement Capital Covenant was a covenant for the benefit of persons buying, holding or selling specified series of our unsecured long-term indebtedness or our depository institution subsidiaries (the Covered Debt). The original Covered Debt under the Replacement Capital Covenant were the outstanding floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2028.\nThe Replacement Capital Covenant was terminated automatically without further action on November 20, 2019, following the settlement of the partial redemption of approximately $\n50\nmillion aggregate principal amount of floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2028 and the redesignation of our 2.650% Senior Notes due 2026 as Covered Debt for the purposes of the Replacement Capital Covenant, and purchases of the floating rate junior subordinated debentures due 2047 are permissible without issuing qualifying securities under the Replacement Capital Covenant.\nParent Company\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, long-term finance leases included $\n103\nmillion and $\n136\nmillion, respectively, related to our One Lincoln Street headquarters building and related underground parking garage. Refer to Note 20 for additional information.\nNote 10.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative financial instruments to support our clients' needs and to manage our interest rate and currency risks. These financial instruments consist of FX contracts such as forwards, futures and options contracts; interest rate contracts such as interest rate swaps (cross currency and single currency) and futures; and other derivative contracts. Derivative instruments used for risk management purposes that are highly effective in offsetting the risk being hedged are generally designated as hedging instruments in hedge accounting relationships, while others are economic hedges and not designated in hedge accounting relationships. Derivatives in hedge accounting relationships are disclosed according to the type of hedge, such as, fair value, cash flow, or net investment. Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in hedge accounting relationships are carried at fair value with change in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of income or OCI, as appropriate. Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include those derivatives entered into to support client needs and derivatives used to manage interest rate or foreign currency risk associated with certain assets and liabilities. Such derivatives are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of income.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nWe provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of our client needs, and also act as a dealer in the currency markets. As part of our trading activities, we assume positions in both the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate options, interest rate forward contracts, and interest rate futures. The entire change in the fair value of our non-hedging derivatives utilized in our trading activities are recorded in foreign exchange trading services revenue, and the entire change in fair value of our non-hedging derivatives utilized in our asset-and-liability management activities are recorded in net interest income.\nWe enter into stable value wrap derivative contracts with unaffiliated stable value funds that\nState Street Corporation | 158\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nallow a stable value fund to provide book value coverage to its participants. These derivatives contracts qualify as guarantees as described in Note 12.\nWe grant deferred cash awards to certain of our employees as part of our employee incentive compensation plans. We account for these awards as derivative financial instruments, as the underlying referenced shares are not equity instruments of ours. The fair value of these derivatives is referenced to the value of units in State Street-sponsored investment funds or funds sponsored by other unrelated entities. We re-measure these derivatives to fair value quarterly, and record the change in value in compensation and employee benefits expenses in our consolidated statement of income.\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\nIn connection with our asset-and-liability management activities, we use derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk and foreign currency risk for certain assets and liabilities. At both the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, we formally assess and document the effectiveness of a derivative designated in a hedging relationship and the likelihood that the derivative will be an effective hedge in future periods. We discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when we determine that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the underlying risk being hedged, the derivative expires, terminates or is sold, or management discontinues the hedge designation.\nThe risk management objective of a highly effective hedging strategy that qualifies for hedge accounting must be formally documented. The hedge documentation includes the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction, type of risk being hedged and method for assessing hedge effectiveness of the derivative prospectively and retrospectively. We use quantitative methods including regression analysis and cumulative dollar offset method, comparing the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in fair value or the cash flows of the hedged item. We may also utilize qualitative methods such as matching critical terms and evaluation of any changes in those critical terms. Effectiveness is assessed and documented quarterly and if determined that the derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated risk hedge accounting is discontinued.\nFair Value Hedges\nDerivatives designated as fair value hedges are utilized to mitigate the risk of changes in the fair values of recognized assets and liabilities, including long-term debt, AFS securities, and foreign currency investment securities. We use interest rate or FX\ncontracts in this manner to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of hedged items caused by changes in interest rates or FX rates.\nChanges in the fair value of the derivative and changes in fair value of the hedged item due to changes in the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the same line item. If a hedge is terminated, but the hedged item was not derecognized, all remaining adjustments to the carrying amount of the hedged item are amortized over a period that is consistent with the amortization of other discounts or premiums associated with the hedged item\n.\nCash Flow Hedges\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedges are utilized to offset the variability of cash flows of recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions. We have entered into FX contracts to hedge the change in cash flows attributable to FX movements in foreign currency denominated investment securities. Additionally, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the forecasted cash flows associated with LIBOR indexed floating-rate loans. The interest rate swaps synthetically convert the loan interest receipts from a variable-rate to a fixed-rate, thereby mitigating the risk attributable to changes in the LIBOR benchmark rate.\nChanges in fair value of the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially recorded in AOCI and then reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings and are presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. If the hedge relationship is terminated, the change in fair value on the derivative recorded in AOCI is reclassified into earnings consistent with the timing of the hedged item. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original hedge terms, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2020, the maximum maturity date of the underlying loans is approximately\n3.7\nyears.\nNet Investment Hedges\nDerivatives categorized as net investment hedges are entered into to protect the net investment in our foreign operations against adverse changes in exchange rates. We use FX forward contracts to convert the foreign currency risk to U.S. dollars to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in FX rates. The changes in fair value of the FX forward contracts are recorded, net of taxes, in the foreign currency translation component of OCI.\nState Street Corporation | 159\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents the aggregate contractual, or notional, amounts of derivative financial instruments including those entered into for trading and asset-and-liability management activities as of the dates indicated:\n(1)\nThe notional value of the stable value contracts represents our maximum exposure. However, exposure to various stable value contracts is generally contractually limited to substantially lower amounts than the notional values.\n(2) Represents grants of deferred value awards to employees; refer to discussion in this note under \"Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments.\"\nNotional amounts are provided here as an indication of the volume of our derivative activity and serve as a reference to calculate the fair values of the derivative.\nThe following tables present the fair value of derivative financial instruments, excluding the impact of master netting agreements, recorded in our consolidated statement of condition as of the dates indicated. The impact of master netting agreements is provided in Note 11.\n(1)\nDerivative assets are included within other assets in our consolidated statement of condition.\n(2)\nDerivative liabilities are included within other liabilities in our consolidated statement of condition.\nState Street Corporation | 160\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following tables present the impact of our use of derivative financial instruments on our consolidated statement of income for the periods indicated:\nThe following table shows the carrying amount and associated cumulative basis adjustments related to the application of hedge accounting that is included in the carrying amount of hedged assets and liabilities in fair value hedging relationships:\n(1)\nRepresents hedged items no longer designated in qualifying fair value hedging relationships for which an associated basis adjustment exists at the balance sheet date.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the total notional amount of the interest rate swaps of fair value hedges was $\n2.60\nbillion and $\n10.20\nbillion, respectively.\nState Street Corporation | 161\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following tables present the impact of our use of derivative financial instruments on our consolidated statement of income for the periods indicated:\n(1)\nIn 2020, 2019 and 2018, $\n3\nmillion, $\n18\nmillion and $\n24\nmillion, respectively, of net unrealized gains on AFS investment securities designated in fair value hedges were recognized in OCI.\nDerivatives Netting and Credit Contingencies\nNetting\nDerivatives receivable and payable as well as cash collateral from the same counterparty are netted in the consolidated statement of condition for those counterparties with whom we have legally binding master netting agreements in place. In addition to cash collateral received and transferred presented on a net basis, we also receive and transfer collateral in the form of securities, which mitigate credit risk but are not eligible for netting. Additional information on netting is provided in Note 11.\nCredit Contingencies\nCertain of our derivatives are subject to master netting agreements with our derivative counterparties containing credit risk-related contingent features, which requires us to maintain an investment grade credit rating with the various credit rating agencies. If our rating falls below investment grade, we would be in violation of the provisions, and counterparties to the derivatives could request immediate payment or demand full overnight collateralization on derivatives instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivatives with credit contingent features and in a liability position as of December 31, 2020 totaled approximately $\n3.91\nbillion, against which we provided $\n1.69\nbillion of collateral in the normal course of business. If our credit related contingent features underlying these agreements were triggered as of December 31, 2020, the maximum additional collateral we would be required to post to our counterparties is approximately $\n2.22\nbillion.\nState Street Corporation | 162\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 11.\nOffsetting Arrangements\nCertain of our transactions are subject to master netting agreements that allow us to net receivables and payables by contract and settlement type. For those legally enforceable contracts, we net receivables and payables with the same counterparty on our statement of condition.\nIn addition to netting receivables and payables with our derivatives counterparty where a legal and enforceable netting arrangement exist, we also net related cash collateral received and transferred up to the fair value exposure amount.\nWith respect to our securities financing arrangements, we net balances outstanding on our consolidated statement of condition for those transactions that met the netting requirements and were transacted under a legally enforceable netting arrangement with the counterparty.\nSecurities received as collateral under securities financing or derivatives transactions can be transferred as collateral in many instances. The securities received as proceeds under secured lending transactions are recorded at a value that approximates fair value in other assets in our consolidated statement of condition with a related liability to return the collateral, if we have the right to transfer or re-pledge the collateral.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the value of securities received as collateral from third parties where we are permitted to transfer or re-pledge the securities totaled $\n6.48\nbillion and $\n10.09\nbillion, respectively, and the fair value of the portion that had been transferred or re-pledged as of the same dates was $\n3.88\nbillion and $\n5.72\nmillion, respectively.\nThe following tables present information about the offsetting of assets related to derivative contracts and secured financing transactions, as of the dates indicated:\nState Street Corporation | 163\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(1)\nAmounts include all transactions regardless of whether or not they are subject to an enforceable netting arrangement.\n(2)\nRefer to Note 1 and Note 2 for additional information about the measurement basis of derivative instruments.\n(3)\nAmounts subject to netting arrangements which have been determined to be legally enforceable and eligible for netting in the consolidated statement of condition.\n(4)\nIncludes securities in connection with our securities borrowing transactions.\n(5)\nIncludes amounts secured by collateral not determined to be subject to enforceable netting arrangements.\n(6)\nVariation margin payments presented as settlements rather than collateral.\n(7)\nIncluded in the $\n21.44\nbillion as of December 31, 2020 were $\n3.11\nbillion of resale agreements and $\n18.33\nbillion of collateral provided related to securities borrowing. Included in the $\n20.01\nbillion as of December 31, 2019 were $\n1.49\nbillion of resale agreements and $\n18.52\nbillion of collateral provided related to securities borrowing. Resale agreements and collateral provided related to securities borrowing were recorded in securities purchased under resale agreements and other assets, respectively, in our consolidated statement of condition. Refer to Note 12 for additional information with respect to principal securities finance transactions.\n(8)\nOffsetting of resale agreements primarily relates to our involvement in FICC, where we settle transactions on a net basis for payment and delivery through the Fedwire system.\nNA\nNot applicable\nThe following tables present information about the offsetting of liabilities related to derivative contracts and secured financing transactions, as of the dates indicated:\nState Street Corporation | 164\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(1)\nAmounts include all transactions regardless of whether or not they are subject to an enforceable netting arrangement.\n(2)\nRefer to Note 1 and Note 2 for additional information about the measurement basis of derivative instruments.\n(3)\nAmounts subject to netting arrangements which have been determined to be legally enforceable and eligible for netting in the consolidated statement of condition.\n(4)\nIncludes securities provided in connection with our securities lending transactions.\n(5)\nIncludes amounts secured by collateral not determined to be subject to enforceable netting arrangements.\n(6)\nVariation margin payments presented as settlements rather than collateral.\n(7)\nIncluded in the $\n12.77\nbillion as of December 31, 2020 were $\n3.41\nbillion of repurchase agreements and $\n9.36\nbillion of collateral received related to securities lending transactions. Included in the $\n11.88\nbillion as of December 31, 2019 were $\n1.10\nbillion of repurchase agreements and $\n10.77\nbillion of collateral received related to securities lending transactions. Repurchase agreements and collateral received related to securities lending were recorded in securities sold under repurchase agreements and accrued expenses and other liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated statement of condition. Refer to Note 12 for additional information with respect to principal securities finance transactions.\n(8)\nOffsetting of repurchase agreements primarily relates to our involvement in FICC, where we settle transactions on a net basis for payment and delivery through the Fedwire system.\nNA\nNot applicable\nThe securities transferred under resale and repurchase agreements typically are U.S. Treasury, agency and agency MBS. In our principal securities borrowing and lending arrangements, the securities transferred are predominantly equity securities and some corporate debt securities. The fair value of the securities transferred may increase in value to an amount greater than the amount received under our repurchase and securities lending arrangements, which exposes us to counterparty risk. We require the review of the price of the underlying securities in relation to the carrying value of the repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements on a daily basis and when appropriate, adjust the cash or security to be obtained or returned to counterparties that is reflective of the required collateral levels.\nThe following table summarizes our repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions by category of collateral pledged and remaining maturity of these agreements as of the periods indicated:\n(1)\nRepresents a security interest in underlying client assets related to our enhanced custody business, which assets clients have allowed us to transfer and re-pledge.\nState Street Corporation | 165\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 12.\nCommitments and Guarantees\nThe following table presents the aggregate gross contractual amounts of our off-balance sheet commitments and off-balance sheet guarantees as of the dates indicated:\n(1)\nThe potential losses associated with these guarantees equal the gross contractual amounts and do not consider the value of any collateral or reflect any participations to independent third parties.\nUnfunded Credit Facilities\nUnfunded credit facilities consist primarily of liquidity facilities provided to  our fund and municipal counterparties, as well as commitments to purchase commercial real estate and leveraged loans that have not yet settled.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately\n73\n% of our unfunded commitments to extend credit expire within\none year\n. Since many of these commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn upon, the gross contractual amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements.\nIndemnified Securities Financing\nOn behalf of our clients, we lend their securities, as agent, to brokers and other institutions. In most circumstances, we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities. We require the borrowers to maintain collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. Securities on loan and the collateral are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary or if excess collateral is required to be returned to the borrower. Collateral received in connection with our securities lending services is held by us as agent and is not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition.\nThe cash collateral held by us as agent is invested on behalf of our clients. In certain cases, the cash collateral is invested in third-party repurchase agreements, for which we indemnify the client against the loss of the principal invested. We require the counterparty to the indemnified repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount in excess of 100% of the amount of the repurchase agreement. In our role as agent, the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral held by us are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition.\nThe following table summarizes the aggregate fair values of indemnified securities financing and related collateral, as well as collateral invested in indemnified repurchase agreements, as of the dates indicated:\nIn certain cases, we participate in securities finance transactions as a principal. As a principal, we borrow securities from the lending client and then lend such securities to the subsequent borrower, either our client or a broker/dealer. Our right to receive and obligation to return collateral in connection with our securities lending transactions are recorded in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated statement of condition. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we had approximately $\n18.33\nbillion and $\n18.52\nbillion, respectively, of collateral provided and approximately $\n9.36\nbillion and $\n10.77\nbillion, respectively, of collateral received from clients in connection with our participation in principal securities finance transactions.\nStable Value Protection\nStable value funds wrapped by us are high quality diversified portfolios of short intermediate duration fixed-income investments. Stable value contracts are derivative contracts that also qualify as guarantees. The notional amount under non-hedging derivatives, provided in Note 10, generally represents our maximum exposure under these derivatives contracts. However, exposure to various stable value contracts is contractually limited to substantially lower amounts than the notional values, which represent the total assets of the stable value funds.\nStandby Letters of Credit\nStandby letters of credit provide credit enhancement to our municipal clients to support the issuance of capital markets financing.\nState Street Corporation | 166\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 13.\nContingencies\nLegal and Regulatory Matters\nIn the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are involved in disputes, litigation, and governmental or regulatory inquiries and investigations, both pending and threatened. These matters, if resolved adversely against us or settled, may result in monetary awards or payments, fines and penalties or require changes in our business practices. The resolution or settlement of these matters is inherently difficult to predict. Based on our assessment of these pending matters, we do not believe that the amount of any judgment, settlement or other action arising from any pending matter is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. However, an adverse outcome or development in certain of the matters described below could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the period in which such matter is resolved, or an accrual is determined to be required, on our consolidated financial condition, or on our reputation.\nWe evaluate our needs for accruals of loss contingencies related to legal and regulatory proceedings on a case-by-case basis. When we have a liability that we deem probable, and we deem the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated as of the date of our consolidated financial statements, we accrue our estimate of the amount of loss. We also consider a loss probable and establish an accrual when we make, or intend to make, an offer of settlement. Once established, an accrual is subject to subsequent adjustment as a result of additional information. The resolution of legal and regulatory proceedings and the amount of reasonably estimable loss (or range thereof) are inherently difficult to predict, especially in the early stages of proceedings. Even if a loss is probable, an amount (or range) of loss might not be reasonably estimated until the later stages of the proceeding due to many factors such as the presence of complex or novel legal theories, the discretion of governmental authorities in seeking sanctions or negotiating resolutions in civil and criminal matters, the pace and timing of discovery and other assessments of facts and the procedural posture of the matter (collectively, \"factors influencing reasonable estimates\").\nAs of December 31, 2020, our aggregate accruals for loss contingencies for legal, regulatory and related matters totaled approximately $\n144\nmillion, including potential fines by government agencies and civil litigation with respect to the matters specifically discussed below. To the extent that we have established accruals in our consolidated statement of condition for probable loss contingencies, such accruals may not be sufficient to\ncover our ultimate financial exposure associated with any settlements or judgments. Any such ultimate financial exposure, or proceedings to which we may become subject in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, on our future consolidated financial statements or on our reputation.\nAs of December 31, 2020, for those matters for which we have accrued probable loss contingencies (including the Invoicing Matter described below) and for other matters for which loss is reasonably possible (but not probable) in future periods, and for which we are able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, our estimate of the aggregate reasonably possible loss (in excess of any accrued amounts) ranges up to approximately $\n40\nmillion. Our estimate with respect to the aggregate reasonably possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties, which may change quickly and significantly from time to time, particularly if and as we engage with applicable governmental agencies or plaintiffs in connection with a proceeding. Also, the matters underlying the reasonably possible loss will change from time to time. As a result, actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate.\nIn certain pending matters, it is not currently feasible to reasonably estimate the amount or a range of reasonably possible loss, and such losses, which may be significant, are not included in the estimate of reasonably possible loss discussed above. This is due to, among other factors, the factors influencing reasonable estimates described above. An adverse outcome in one or more of the matters for which we have not estimated the amount or a range of reasonably possible loss, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, on our future consolidated financial statements or on our reputation. Given that our actual losses from any legal or regulatory proceeding for which we have provided an estimate of the reasonably possible loss could significantly exceed such estimate, and given that we cannot estimate reasonably possible loss for all legal and regulatory proceedings as to which we may be subject now or in the future, no conclusion as to our ultimate exposure from current pending or potential legal or regulatory proceedings should be drawn from the current estimate of reasonably possible loss.\nThe following discussion provides information with respect to significant legal, governmental and regulatory matters.\nInvoicing Matter\nIn 2015, we determined that we had incorrectly invoiced clients for certain expenses. We have\nState Street Corporation | 167\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nreimbursed most of our affected customers for those expenses, and we have implemented enhancements to our billing processes. In connection with our enhancements to our billing processes, we continue to review historical billing practices and may from time to time identify additional remediation. In 2017, we identified an additional area of incorrect expense billing associated with mailing services in our retirement services business. We currently expect the cumulative total of our payments to customers for these invoicing errors, including the error in the retirement services business, to be at least $\n370\nmillion, all of which has been paid or is accrued. However, we may identify additional remediation costs.\nIn March 2017, a purported class action was commenced against us alleging that our invoicing practices violated duties owed to retirement plan customers under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. In addition, we have received a purported class action demand letter alleging that our invoicing practices were unfair and deceptive under Massachusetts law. A class of customers, or particular customers, may assert that we have not paid to them all amounts incorrectly invoiced, and may seek double or treble damages under Massachusetts law.\nWe are also cooperating with investigations by governmental and regulatory authorities on these matters, including the civil and criminal divisions of the DOJ and the DOL, which reviews could result in significant fines or other sanctions, civil and criminal, against us. In June 2019, we reached an agreement with the SEC to settle its claims that we violated the recordkeeping provisions of Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and caused violations of Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act and Rules 31a-1(a) and 31a-1(b) thereunder in connection with our overcharges of customers which are registered investment companies. In reaching this settlement, we neither admitted nor denied the claims contained in the SEC’s order, and agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $\n40\nmillion. Also in June 2019, we reached an agreement with the Massachusetts Attorney General’s office to resolve its claims related to this matter. In reaching this settlement, we neither admitted nor denied the claims in the order, and agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of $\n5.5\nmillion. The costs associated with these settlements were within our related previously established accruals for loss contingencies. The SEC and Massachusetts Attorney General’s office settlements both recognize that the payment of $\n48.8\nmillion in disgorgement and interest is satisfied by our direct reimbursements of our customers.\nIn January 2020, the DOJ outlined a framework for a possible resolution of their review. We are discussing the terms of a potential settlement of this matter with the DOJ. Separately, we have inquired of the DOL as to the status of their review but have not entered into settlement discussions with the DOL. There can be no assurance that any settlement with the DOJ or DOL will be reached on financial or other terms acceptable to us or at all. The aggregate amount of penalties that may potentially be imposed upon us in connection with the resolution of all outstanding investigations into our historical billing practices is not currently known. We have established a legal accrual with respect to the pending governmental investigations and civil litigation with respect to this matter, however, our ultimate liability with respect to this matter might be significantly in excess of our current accrual. Government authorities have significant discretion in criminal and civil matters as to the fines and other penalties they may seek to impose.  Any resolution of the DOJ and DOL claims may involve penalties that could be a significant percentage, or a multiple of, all or a portion of the overcharge.  The severity of such fines or penalties could take into account factors such as the amount or duration of our incorrect invoicing and the government’s or regulators’ assessment of the conduct of our employees, as well as prior conduct such as that which resulted in our January 2017 deferred prosecution agreement and settlement of civil claims regarding our indirect FX business.\nThe outcome of any of these proceedings and, in particular, any criminal sanction could materially adversely affect our results of operations and could have significant additional consequences for our business and reputation.\nFederal Reserve/Massachusetts Division of Banks Written Agreement\nOn June 1, 2015, we entered into a written agreement with the Federal Reserve and the Massachusetts Division of Banks relating to deficiencies identified in our compliance programs with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, Anti-Money Laundering regulations and U.S. economic sanctions regulations promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. As part of this enforcement action, we have been required to, among other things, implement improvements to our compliance programs. In June 2020, the Federal Reserve and the Massachusetts Division of Banks terminated the written agreement, based on our compliance with its requirements.\nShareholder Litigation\nA shareholder of ours has filed a derivative complaint against the Company’s past and present officers and directors to recover alleged losses\nState Street Corporation | 168\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nincurred by the Company relating to the invoicing matter and to the Ohio public retirement plans matter.\nIncome Taxes\nIn determining our provision for income taxes, we make certain judgments and interpretations with respect to tax laws in jurisdictions in which we have business operations. Because of the complex nature of these laws, in the normal course of our business, we are subject to challenges from U.S. and non-U.S. income tax authorities regarding the amount of income taxes due. These challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of taxable income among tax jurisdictions. We recognize a tax benefit when it is more likely than not that our position will result in a tax deduction or credit. Unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $\n308\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 increased from $\n149\nmillion as of December 31, 2019.\nWe are presently under audit by a number of tax authorities, and the Internal Revenue Service is currently reviewing our U.S. income tax returns, including amended returns, for tax years 2014-2018. The earliest tax year open to examination in jurisdictions where we have material operations is 2013. Management believes that we have sufficiently accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2020 for potential tax exposures.\nNote 14.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe are involved, in the normal course of our business, with various types of special purpose entities, some of which meet the definition of VIEs. When evaluating a VIE for consolidation, we must determine whether or not we have a variable interest in the entity. Variable interests are investments or other interests that absorb portions of an entity’s expected losses or receive portions of the entity’s expected returns. If it is determined that we do not have a variable interest in the VIE, no further analysis is required and we do not consolidate the VIE. If we hold a variable interest in a VIE, we are required by U.S. GAAP to consolidate that VIE when we have a controlling financial interest in the VIE and therefore are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. We are determined to have a controlling financial interest in a VIE when it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to that VIE. This determination is evaluated periodically as facts and circumstances change.\nAsset-Backed Investment Securities\nWe invest in various forms of ABS, which we carry in our investment securities portfolio. These ABS meet the U.S. GAAP definition of asset securitization entities, which are considered to be VIEs. We are not considered to be the primary beneficiary of these VIEs since we do not have control over their activities. Additional information about our ABS is provided in Note 3.\nTax-Exempt Investment Program\nIn the normal course of our business, we structure and sell certificated interests in pools of tax-exempt investment grade assets, principally to our mutual fund clients. We structure these pools as partnership trusts, and the assets and liabilities of the trusts are recorded in our consolidated statement of condition as AFS investment securities and other short-term borrowings. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we carried AFS investment securities, composed of securities related to state and political subdivisions, with a fair value of $\n0.70\nbillion and $\n0.94\nbillion, respectively, and other short-term borrowings of $\n0.62\nbillion and $\n0.82\nbillion, respectively, in our consolidated statement of condition in connection with these trusts. The interest income and interest expense generated by the investments and certificated interests, respectively, are recorded as components of NII when earned or incurred.\nWe transfer assets to the trusts from our investment securities portfolio at adjusted book value, and the trusts finance the acquisition of these assets by selling certificated interests issued by the trust to third-party investors and to us as residual holder. These transfers do not meet the de-recognition criteria defined by U.S. GAAP, and therefore, the assets continue to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. The trusts had a weighted-average life of approximately\n2.7\nyears as of December 31, 2020, compared to approximately\n3.0\nyears as of December 31, 2019.\nState Street Corporation | 169\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUnder separate legal agreements, we provide liquidity facilities to these trusts and, with respect to certain securities, letters of credit. As of December 31, 2020, our commitments to the trusts under these liquidity facilities and/or letters of credit totaled $\n0.62\nbillion, and neither of the liquidity facilities nor letters of credit were utilized. In the event that our obligations under these liquidity facilities are triggered, no material impact to our consolidated results of operations or financial condition is expected to occur, because the securities are already recorded at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition. In addition, neither creditors or third-party investors in the trusts have any recourse to our general credit other than through the liquidity facilities and letters of credit noted above.\nInterests in Investment Funds\nIn the normal course of business, we manage various types of investment funds through State Street Global Advisors in which\nour clients are investors, including State Street Global Advisors commingled investment vehicles and other similar investment structures. The majority of our AUM are contained within such funds. The services we provide to these funds generate management fee revenue. From time to time, we may invest cash in the funds in order for the funds to establish a performance history for newly-launched strategies, referred to as seed capital, or for other purposes.\nWith respect to our interests in funds that meet the definition of a VIE, a primary beneficiary assessment is performed to determine if we have a controlling financial interest. As part of our assessment, we consider all the facts and circumstances regarding the terms and characteristics of the variable interest(s), the design and characteristics of the fund and the other involvements of the enterprise with the fund. Upon consolidation of certain funds, we retain the specialized investment company accounting rules followed by the underlying funds.\nAll of the underlying investments held by such consolidated funds are carried at fair value, with corresponding changes in the investments’ fair values reflected in foreign exchange trading services revenue in our consolidated statement of income. When we no longer control these funds due to a\nreduced ownership interest or other reasons, the funds are de-consolidated and accounted for under another accounting method if we continue to maintain investments in the funds.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the aggregate assets and liabilities of our consolidated sponsored investment funds totaled $\n17\nmillion and $\n4\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate assets and liabilities of our consolidated sponsored investment funds totaled $\n21\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our maximum total exposure associated with the consolidated sponsored investment funds totaled $\n13\nmillion and $\n15\nmillion, respectively, and represented the value of our economic ownership interest in the funds.\nOur conclusion to consolidate a fund may vary from period to period, most commonly as a result of fluctuation in our ownership interest as a result of changes in the number of fund shares held by either us or by third parties. Given that the funds follow specialized investment company accounting rules which prescribe fair value, a de-consolidation generally would not result in gains or losses for us.\nThe net assets of any consolidated fund are solely available to settle the liabilities of the fund and to settle any investors’ ownership redemption requests, including any seed capital invested in the fund by us. We are not contractually required to provide financial or any other support to any of our funds. In addition, neither creditors nor equity investors in the funds have any recourse to our general credit.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we managed certain funds, considered VIEs, in which we held a variable interest but for which we were not deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Our potential maximum loss exposure related to these unconsolidated funds totaled $\n22\nmillion and $\n21\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and represented the carrying value of our investments, which are recorded in other assets in our consolidated statement of condition. The amount of loss we may recognize during any period is limited to the carrying amount of our investments in the unconsolidated funds.\nState Street Corporation | 170\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 15.\nShareholders' Equity\nPreferred Stock\nThe following table summarizes selected terms of each of the series of the preferred stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2020:\n(1)\nOn the redemption date, or any dividend payment date thereafter, the preferred stock and corresponding depositary shares may be redeemed by us, in whole or in part, at the liquidation price per share and liquidation price per depositary share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends.\n(2)\nThe preferred stock and corresponding depositary shares may be redeemed at our option in whole, but not in part, prior to the redemption date upon the occurrence of a regulatory capital treatment event, as defined in the certificate of designation, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation price per share and liquidation price per depositary share plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends.\n(3)\nSeries F preferred stock is redeemable on September 15, 2020 and on each succeeding dividend payment date. We did not elect redemption on September 15, 2020 or December 15, 2020.\nWe redeemed all outstanding Series C non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock on March 15, 2020 at a redemption price of $\n500\nmillion ($\n100,000\nper share equivalent to $\n25.00\nper depositary share) plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The difference of $\n9\nmillion between the redemption value and the net carrying value resulted in an EPS impact of approximately ($\n0.03\n) per share in the first quarter of 2020.\nOn January 14, 2021, we announced that we will redeem on March 15, 2021 an aggregate of $\n500\nmillion, or\n5,000\nof the\n7,500\noutstanding shares of our non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series F, for cash at a  redemption price of $\n100,000\nper share (equivalent to $\n1,000\nper depositary share) plus all declared and unpaid dividends. A cash dividend of $\n953.38\nper share of Series F Preferred Stock (or approximately $\n9.5338\nper depositary share) has been declared for the period from December 15, 2020 up to but not including March 15, 2021 (the “March Dividend”). The March Dividend will be paid separately to the holders of record of the Series F Preferred Stock as of March 1, 2021 in the customary manner. Accordingly, there will not be any declared and unpaid dividends included in the redemption price.\nThe following table presents the dividends declared for each of the series of preferred stock issued and outstanding for the periods indicated:\nIn January 2021, we declared dividends on our series D, F, and G preferred stock of approximately $\n1,475\n, $\n953\n, and $\n1,338\n, respectively, per share, or approximately $\n0.37\n, $\n9.53\n, and $\n0.33\n, respectively, per depositary share. These dividends total approximately $\n11\nmillion, $\n7\nmillion, and $\n7\nmillion on our series D, F, and G preferred stock, respectively, which will be paid in March 2021.\nState Street Corporation | 171\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCommon Stock\nIn June 2019, our Board approved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $\n2.0\nbillion of our common stock from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 (the 2019 Program). We repurchased $\n500\nmillion of our common stock in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 under the 2019 Program. On March 16, 2020, we, along with the other U.S. G-SIBs, suspended common share repurchases and maintained this suspension through the fourth quarter of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This suspension was consistent with limitations imposed by the Federal Reserve beginning in the second quarter of 2020. As a result, we had no repurchases of our common stock in the second, third or fourth quarters of 2020.\nIn June 2020, concurrent with the release of  the\nCCAR 2020 results, the Federal Reserve announced that  all CCAR banks were required to resubmit their capital plan and stress test results based on scenarios to be provided in September 2020.  Scenarios were provided on September 17, 2020 with materials due on November 2, 2020.  In December 2020, the Federal Reserve issued results of 2020 resubmission stress tests and authorized us to continue to pay common stock dividends at current levels and to resume repurchasing common shares in the first quarter of 2021.\nIn January 2021, our Board authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $\n475\nmillion of our common stock through March 31, 2021.\nIn June 2018, our Board approved a common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $\n1.2\nbillion of our common stock through June 30, 2019 (the 2018 Program). We repurchased $\n300\nmillion of our common stock in each of the first and second quarters of 2019 under the 2018 Program.\nThe table below presents the activity under our common stock purchase program for the period indicated:\nThe table below presents the dividends declared on common stock for the periods indicated:\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe following table presents the after-tax components of AOCI for the periods indicated:\nState Street Corporation | 172\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents changes in AOCI by component, net of related taxes, for the periods indicated:\n(1)\nRepresents the reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income into retained earnings as a result of our adoption of ASU 2018-02 - Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the first quarter of 2019.\nThe following table presents after-tax reclassifications into earnings for the periods indicated:\nState Street Corporation | 173\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 16.\nRegulatory Capital\nWe are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our consolidated financial condition. Under current regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, we must meet specified capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of our consolidated assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures calculated in conformity with regulatory accounting practices. Our capital components and their classifications are subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\nAs required by the Dodd-Frank Act, we and State Street Bank, as advanced approaches banking organizations, are subject to a \"capital floor\" in the calculation and assessment of regulatory capital adequacy by U.S. banking regulators. Beginning on January 1, 2015, we were required to calculate our risk- based capital ratios using both the advanced approaches and the standardized approach. As a result, from January 1, 2015 going forward, our risk-based capital ratios for regulatory assessment purposes are the lower of each ratio calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches.\nThe methods for the calculation of our and State Street Bank's risk-based capital ratios have changed as the provisions of the Basel III rule related to the numerator (capital) and denominator (RWA) were phased in, and as we calculated our RWA using the advanced approaches. These ongoing methodological changes have resulted in differences in our reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the next that are independent of applicable changes to our capital base, our asset composition, our off-balance sheet exposures or our risk profile.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we and State Street Bank exceeded all regulatory capital adequacy requirements to which we were subject. As of December 31, 2020, State Street Bank was categorized as “well capitalized” under the applicable regulatory capital adequacy framework, and exceeded all “well capitalized” ratio guidelines to which it was subject. Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred since December 31, 2020 that have changed the capital categorization of State Street Bank.\nThe following table presents the regulatory capital structure, total RWA, related regulatory capital ratios and the minimum required regulatory capital ratios for us and State Street Bank as of the dates indicated. As a result of changes in the methodologies used to calculate our regulatory capital ratios from period to period as the provisions of the Basel III rule were phased in, the ratios presented in the table for each period-end are not directly comparable. Refer to the footnotes following the table.\nState Street Corporation | 174\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(1)\nOther adjustments within CET1 primarily include the overfunded portion of the firm’s defined benefit pension plan obligation net of associated deferred tax liabilities, disallowed deferred tax assets, and other required credit risk based deductions.\n(2)\nIncludes a CVA which reflects the risk of potential fair value adjustments for credit risk reflected in our valuation of OTC derivative contracts. We used a simple CVA approach in conformity with the Basel III advanced approaches.\n(3)\nUnder the current advanced approaches rules and regulatory guidance concerning operational risk models, RWA attributable to operational risk can vary substantially from period-to-period, without direct correlation to the effects of a particular loss event on our results of operations and financial condition and impacting dates and periods that may differ from the dates and periods as of and during which the loss event is reflected in our financial statements, with the timing and categorization dependent on the processes for model updates and, if applicable, model revalidation and regulatory review and related supervisory processes. An individual loss event can have a significant effect on the output of our operational RWA under the advanced approaches depending on the severity of the loss event and its categorization among the seven Basel-defined UOMs.\n(4)\nAssuming a countercyclical buffer of\n0\n%, the minimum requirements include a capital conservation buffer and a stress capital buffer for advanced and standardized, respectively, and a G-SIB surcharge.\n(5)\nAssuming a countercyclical buffer of\n0\n%, the minimum requirements include a capital conservation buffer and a G-SIB surcharge.\n(6)\nState Street Bank is required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of\n5\n% as it is the insured depository institution subsidiary of one of the eight US G-SIBs.\nNA\nNot applicable\nState Street Corporation | 175\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 17.\nNet Interest Income\nThe following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense, and related NII, for the periods indicated:\nNote 18.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe record compensation expense for equity-based awards, such as deferred stock and performance awards, based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted if appropriate, based on the eligibility of the award to receive dividends.\nCompensation expense related to equity-based awards with service-only conditions and terms that provide for a graded vesting schedule is recognized on a straight-line basis over the required service period for the entire award. Compensation expense related to equity-based awards with performance conditions and terms that provide for a graded vesting schedule is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting tranche of the award, and is based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions at each reporting date. Compensation expense is adjusted for assumptions with respect to the estimated amount of awards that will be forfeited prior to vesting, and for employees who have met certain retirement eligibility criteria. Compensation expense for common stock awards granted to employees meeting early retirement eligibility criteria is fully expensed on the grant date.\nDividend equivalents for certain equity-based awards are paid on stock units on a current basis prior to vesting and distribution.\nThe 2017 Stock Incentive Plan, or 2017 Plan, was approved by shareholders in May 2017 for issuance of stock and stock based awards. Awards may be made under the 2017 Plan for (i) up to\n8.3\nmillion shares of common stock plus (ii) up to an additional\n28.5\nmillion shares that were available to be issued under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2006 Plan, or may become available for issuance under the 2006 Plan due to expiration, termination, cancellation, forfeiture or repurchase of awards granted under the 2006 Plan. As of December 31, 2020, a total of\n20.5\nmillion shares from the 2006 Plan have been added to and may be issued from the 2017 Plan.\nThe following table presents the cumulative total number of shares that was awarded under the 2017 Plan and the 2006 Plan for the periods indicated:\nThe 2017 Plan allows for shares withheld in payment of the exercise price of an award or in satisfaction of tax withholding requirements, shares forfeited due to employee termination, shares expired under option awards, or shares not delivered when performance conditions have not been met, to be added back to the pool of shares available for issuance under the 2017 Plan. From inception to December 31, 2020,\n1.7\nmillion shares had been awarded under the 2017 Plan but not delivered, and have become available for re-issue. As of December 31, 2020, a total of\n19.2\nmillion shares were available for future issuance under the 2017 Plan.\nFor deferred stock awards granted under the Plans, no common stock is issued at the time of grant and the award does not possess dividend and voting rights. Generally, these grants vest over\none\nto\nfour years\n. Performance awards granted are earned over a performance period based on the achievement of defined goals, generally over\nthree years\n. Payment for performance awards is made in shares of our common stock equal to its fair market value per share, based on the performance of certain financial ratios, after the conclusion of each performance period.\nBeginning with 2012, malus-based forfeiture provisions were included in deferred stock awards granted to employees identified as “material risk-takers,” as defined by management. These malus-\nState Street Corporation | 176\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nbased forfeiture provisions provide for the reduction or cancellation of unvested deferred compensation, such as deferred stock awards and performance based awards, if it is determined that a material risk-taker made risk-based decisions that exposed us to inappropriate risks that resulted in a material unexpected loss at the business-unit, line-of-business or corporate level. In addition, awards granted to certain of our senior executives, as well as awards granted to individuals in certain jurisdictions, may be subject to recoupment after vesting (if applicable) and delivery to the individual in specified circumstances generally relating to fraud or willful misconduct by the individual that results in material harm to us or a material financial restatement.\nCompensation expense related to deferred stock awards and performance awards, which we record as a component of compensation and employee benefits expense in our consolidated statement of income, was  $\n240\nmillion, $\n235\nmillion and $\n262\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Such expense for 2020, 2019 and 2018 excluded an expense of $\n29\nmillion, a release of $\n4\nmillion and an expense of $\n45\nmillion, respectively, associated with acceleration of expense in connection with targeted staff reductions. This expense was included in the severance-related portion of the associated restructuring or repositioning charges recorded in each respective year.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nno\nstock appreciation rights were exercised. As of December 31, 2020, there was\nno\nunrecognized compensation cost related to stock appreciation rights.\nThe total fair value of deferred stock awards vested for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, based on the weighted average grant date fair value in each respective year, was $\n210\nmillion, $\n220\nmillion and $\n230\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, total unrecognized compensation cost related to deferred stock awards, net of estimated forfeitures, was $\n199\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n2.3\nyears.\nThe total fair value of performance awards vested for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, based on the weighted average grant date fair value in each respective year, was $\n30\nmillion, $\n22\nmillion and $\n32\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, total unrecognized compensation cost related to performance awards, net of estimated forfeitures, was $\n26\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.6\nyears.\nWe utilize either treasury shares or authorized but unissued shares to satisfy the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plans. We do not have a specific policy concerning purchases of our common stock to satisfy stock issuances. We have a general policy concerning purchases of our common stock to meet issuances under our employee benefit plans, including other corporate purposes. Various factors determine the amount and timing of our purchases of our common stock, including regulatory reviews and approvals or non-objections, our regulatory capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue under employee benefit plans, market conditions (including the trading price of our common stock), and legal considerations. These factors can change at any time, and the number of shares of common stock we will purchase or when we will purchase them cannot be assured. Additional information on our common stock purchase program is provided in Note 15.\nState Street Corporation | 177\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 19.\nEmployee Benefits\nDefined Benefit Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nState Street Bank and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries participate in a non-contributory, tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan. The U.S. defined benefit pension plan was frozen as of December 31, 2007 and\nno\nnew employees were eligible to participate after that date. We have agreed to contribute sufficient amounts as necessary to meet the benefits paid to plan participants and to fund the plan’s service cost, plus interest. U.S. employee account balances earn annual interest credits until the employee begins receiving benefits. Non-U.S. employees participate in local defined benefit plans which are funded as required in each local jurisdiction. In addition to the defined benefit pension plans, we have non-qualified unfunded SERPs that provide certain officers with defined pension benefits in excess of allowable qualified plan limits. State Street Bank and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries also participate in a post-retirement plan that provides health care benefits for certain retired employees. The total expense for these tax-qualified and non-qualified plans was $\n25\nmillion, $\n8\nmillion and $\n11\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation, in the consolidated statement of position. The assets held by the defined benefit pension plans are largely made up of common, collective funds that are liquid and invest principally in U.S. equities and high-quality fixed-income investments. The majority of these assets fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The benefit obligations associated with our primary U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans, non-qualified unfunded supplemental retirement plans and post-retirement plans were $\n1.53\nbillion, $\n69\nmillion and $\n4\nmillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and $\n1.37\nbillion, $\n88\nmillion and $\n10\nmillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. As the primary defined benefit plans are frozen, the benefit obligation will only vary over time as a result of changes in market interest rates, the life expectancy of the plan participants and payments made from the plans. The primary U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $\n15\nmillion and overfunded by $\n10\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The non-qualified supplemental retirement plans were underfunded by $\n69\nmillion and $\n88\nmillion  as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The other post-retirement benefit plans were underfunded by $\n4\nmillion and $\n10\nmillion as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The underfunded status is included in other liabilities.\nDefined Contribution Retirement Plans\nWe contribute to employer-sponsored U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans. Our contribution to these plans was $\n168\nmillion, $\n167\nmillion and $\n170\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNote 20.\nOccupancy Expense and Information Systems and Communications Expense\nUpon adoption of Topic 842 on January 1, 2019, we recognized right-of-use assets of approximately $\n0.91\nbillion and lease liabilities of approximately $\n1.06\nbillion.\nOccupancy expense and information systems and communications expense include depreciation of buildings, leasehold improvements, computer hardware and software, equipment, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of lease right-of-use assets. Total depreciation and amortization expense in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n858\nmillion, $\n842\nmillion and $\n599\nmillion, respectively. We recorded a repositioning charge of $\n51\nmillion in occupancy expenses in 2020, consisting of a $\n46\nmillion impairment of right-of-use assets and consisting of $\n5\nmillion for one-time repairs.\nWe use our incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments for finance and operating leases described below. Additionally, we do not separate nonlease components such as real estate taxes and common area maintenance from base lease payments.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, an aggregate net book value of $\n55\nmillion and $\n78\nmillion, respectively, for the finance lease related to our One Lincoln Street Boston headquarters was recorded in premises and equipment, with the related liability of $\n103\nmillion and $\n136\nmillion, respectively, recorded in long-term debt, in our consolidated statement of condition.\nFinance lease right-of-use asset amortization is recorded in occupancy expense on a straight-line basis in our consolidated statement of income over the respective lease term. As of December 31, 2020, accumulated amortization of the finance lease right-of-use asset was $\n75\nmillion. Lease payments are recorded as a reduction of the liability, with a portion recorded as imputed interest expense. In 2020 and 2019, interest expense related to the finance lease obligation reflected in NII was $\n9\nmillion and $\n11\nmillion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, an aggregate net book value of $\n720\nmillion for the operating lease right-of-use assets is recorded in other assets, with the related lease liability of $\n891\nmillion recorded in\nState Street Corporation | 178\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\naccrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated statement of condition.\nWe have entered into non-cancellable operating leases for premises and equipment. Nearly all of these leases include renewal options, and only those reasonably certain of being exercised are included in the term of the lease. Costs for operating leases are recorded on a straight-line basis which includes both interest expense and right-of-use asset amortization. Operating lease costs for office space are recorded in occupancy expense. Costs related to operating leases for equipment are recorded in information systems and communications expense.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have additional operating leases, primarily for office space, that have not yet commenced of approximately $\n462\nmillion of undiscounted future minimum lease payments. These leases will commence between fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2023 with lease terms of\n10\nto\n15\nyears. The majority of these future payments relate to the new Boston headquarters lease executed in the first quarter of 2019, replacing the One Lincoln Street Boston property.\nNone of our leases contain residual value guarantees.\nThe following table presents lease costs, sublease rental income, cash flows and new leases arising from lease transactions for 2020:\nThe following table presents future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable leases as of December 31, 2020:\nThe following table presents details related to remaining lease terms and discount rate as of December 31, 2020:\nNote 21.\nExpenses\nThe following table presents the components of other expenses for the periods indicated:\nAcquisition Costs\nWe recorded approximately $\n54\nmillion of acquisition costs in 2020 compared to $\n79\nmillion in  2019 and $\n31\nmillion in 2018, related to our acquisition of CRD.\nState Street Corporation | 179\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRestructuring and Repositioning Charges\nRepositioning Charges\nIn 2020, we recorded $\n133\nmillion of repositioning charges, including $\n82\nmillion of compensation and employee benefits and $\n51\nmillion of occupancy expenses, to further drive automation of processes and organizational simplification enabling workforce rationalization and to reduce our real estate footprint by approximately\n13\n% of our total square footage.\nIn 2019, we recorded $\n110\nmillion of repositioning charges, including $\n98\nmillion of compensation and employee benefits expenses and $\n12\nmillion of occupancy costs, to further drive process automation, information technology optimizations and organization rationalization in 2020.\nThe following table presents aggregate activity for repositioning charges and activity related to previous Beacon restructuring charges for the periods indicated:\nNote 22.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use an asset-and-liability approach to account for income taxes. Our objective is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year through charges or credits to the current tax provision, and to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of temporary differences between amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and their respective tax bases. The measurement of tax assets and liabilities is based on enacted tax laws and applicable tax rates. The effects of a tax position on our consolidated financial statements are recognized\nwhen we believe it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained. A valuation allowance is established if it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded in our consolidated statement of condition are netted within the same tax jurisdiction.\nThe following table presents the components of income tax expense (benefit) for the periods indicated:\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate based on income before income tax expense for the periods indicated:\n(1)\nBusiness tax credits include low-income housing, production and investment tax credits.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the accounting for income\ntax\neffects\nof\nthe\nTCJA\nwas\ncompleted\nand\nthe 2018 income tax expense included an additional deferred tax benefit of approximately $\n32\nmillion.\nBeginning in 2018, the TCJA subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiarie\ns.\nWe have elected to recognize our tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred. As such, we have included an estimate of this liability in our estimated annual effective tax rate. This adjustment increased our effective tax rate by\nState Street Corporation | 180\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n0.2\n%,\n0.3\n% and\n0.2\n% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which is reflected in the prior reconciliation table under \"Foreign Tax Credit (Benefits)/Limitations\".\nUndistributed indefinitely reinvested earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $\n5.8\nbillion at December 31, 2020. As a result, no provision has been recorded for state and local or foreign withholding income taxes. If a distribution were to occur, we would be subject to state, local and to foreign withholding tax. It is expected that any distribution will be exempt from federal income tax. Although the foreign withholding tax is generally creditable against U.S. federal income tax, certain credit utilization limitations may result in a net cost.\nThe following table presents significant components of our gross deferred tax assets and gross deferred tax liabilities as of the dates indicated:\nThe table below summarizes the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances recognized as of December 31, 2020:\nManagement considers the valuation allowance adequate to reduce the total deferred tax assets to an aggregate amount that will more likely than not be realized. Management has determined that a\nvaluation allowance is not required for the remaining deferred tax assets because it is more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable income of the appropriate nature within the carryforward periods to realize these assets.\nAt December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest, were $\n308\nmillion, $\n149\nmillion and $\n108\nmillion, respectively. Of this, the amounts that would reduce the effective tax rate, if recognized, are $\n294\nmillion, $\n140\nmillion and $\n100\nmillion, respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate includes the federal benefit for unrecognized state tax benefits.\nThe following table presents activity related to unrecognized tax benefits as of the dates indicated:\nIt is reasonably possible that of the $\n308\nmillion of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020, up to $\n104\nmillion could decrease within the next 12 months due to the resolution of various audits. Management believes that we have sufficient accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2020 for tax exposures and related interest expense.\nIncome tax expense included related interest and penalties of approximately $\n6\nmillion, $\n5\nmillion and $\n1\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Total accrued interest and penalties were approximately $\n14\nmillion, $\n10\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNote 23.\nEarnings Per Common Share\nBasic EPS is calculated pursuant to the two-class method, by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated pursuant to the two-class method, by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the total weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period plus the shares representing the dilutive effect of equity-based awards. The effect of equity-based awards is excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS in periods in which their effect would be anti-dilutive.\nState Street Corporation | 181\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe two-class method requires the allocation of undistributed net income between common and participating shareholders. Net income available to common shareholders, presented separately in our consolidated statement of income, is the basis for the calculation of both basic and diluted EPS. Participating securities are composed of unvested and fully vested SERP shares and fully vested deferred director stock awards, which are equity-based awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, and are considered to participate with the common stock in undistributed earnings.\nThe following table presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the periods indicated:\n(1)\nRepresents the portion of net income available to common equity allocated to participating securities, composed of unvested and fully vested SERP (Supplemental executive retirement plans) shares and fully vested deferred director stock awards, which are equity-based awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, and are considered to participate with the common stock in undistributed earnings.\n(2)\nRepresents equity-based awards outstanding but not included in the computation of diluted average common shares, because their effect was anti-dilutive. Additional information about equity-based awards is provided in Note 18.\n(3)\nCalculations reflect allocation of earnings to participating securities using the two-class method, as this computation is more dilutive than the treasury stock method.\nNote 24.\nLine of Business Information\nOur operations are organized into\ntwo\nlines of business: Investment Servicing and Investment Management, which are defined based on products and services provided. The results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies, including companies in the financial services industry.\nInvestment Servicing,\nthrough\nState Street Institutional Services, State Street Global Markets, State Street Global Exchange and CRD, provides services for U.S. mutual funds, collective investment\nfunds and other investment pools, corporate and public retirement plans, insurance companies, foundations and endowments worldwide. Products include: custody; product accounting; daily pricing and administration; master trust and master custody; depotbank services (a fund oversight role created by non-U.S. regulation); record-keeping; cash management; foreign exchange, brokerage and other trading services; securities finance and enhanced custody products; deposit and short-term investment facilities; loans and lease financing; investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing; performance, risk and compliance analytics; and financial data management to support institutional investors.\nIncluded within our Investment Servicing line of business is CRD, which we acquired in October 2018. The Charles River Investment Management solution is a technology offering which is designed to automate and simplify the institutional investment process across asset classes, from portfolio management and risk analytics through trading and post-trade settlement, with integrated compliance and managed data throughout. With the acquisition of CRD, we took the first step in building our front-to-back platform, State Street Alpha. Today our State Street Alpha platform combines portfolio management, trading and execution, advanced data aggregation, analytics and compliance tools, and integration with other industry platforms and providers.\nInvestment Management\n,\nthrough State Street Global Advisors, provides a broad range of investment management strategies and products for our clients. Our investment management strategies and products span the risk/reward spectrum for equity, fixed income and cash assets, including core and enhanced indexing, multi-asset strategies, active quantitative and fundamental active capabilities and alternative investment strategies. Our AUM is currently primarily weighted to indexed strategies. In addition, we provide a breadth of services and solutions, including environmental, social and governance investing, defined benefit and defined contribution and Global Fiduciary Solutions (formerly Outsourced Chief Investment Officer). State Street Global Advisors is also a provider of ETFs, including the SPDR\n®\nETF brand. While management fees are primarily determined by the values of AUM and the investment strategies employed, management fees reflect other factors as well, including the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees.\nState Street Corporation | 182\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOur investment servicing strategy is to focus on total client relationships and the full integration of our products and services across our client base through cross-selling opportunities. In general, our clients will use a combination of services, depending on their needs, rather than one product or service. For instance, a custody client may purchase securities finance and cash management services from different business units. Products and services that we provide to our clients are parts of an integrated offering to these clients. We price our products and services on the basis of overall client relationships and other factors; as a result, revenue may not necessarily reflect the stand-alone market price of these products and services within the business lines in the same way it would for separate business entities.\nOur servicing and management fee revenue from the Investment Servicing and Investment Management business lines, including foreign exchange trading services and securities finance activities, represents approximately\n70\n% to\n80\n% of our consolidated total revenue. The remaining\n20\n% to\n30\n% is composed of software and processing fees, including CRD, as well as NII, which is largely generated by our investment of client deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt in a variety of assets, and net gains (losses) related to investment securities. These other revenue types are generally fully allocated to, or reside in, Investment Servicing and Investment Management.\nRevenue and expenses are directly charged or allocated to our lines of business through management information systems. Assets and liabilities are allocated according to policies that support management’s strategic and tactical goals. Capital is allocated based on the relative risks and capital requirements inherent in each business line, along with management judgment. Capital allocations may not be representative of the capital that might be required if these lines of business were separate business entities.\nThe following is a summary of our line of business results \"Other\" column for the periods indicated.\nThe following is a summary of our line of business results for the periods indicated. The amounts in the “Other” columns were not allocated to our business lines. Prior reported results reflect reclassifications, for comparative purposes, related to management changes in methodologies associated with allocations of revenue and expenses to lines of business in 2020.\n(1)\nInvestment Servicing includes results from our acquisition of CRD on October 1, 2018.\n(2)\nInvestment Management includes other revenue items that are primarily driven by equity market movements.\nState Street Corporation | 183\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 25.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nWe account for revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with Topic 606, which we adopted on January 1, 2018. The amount of revenue that we recognize is measured based on the consideration specified in contracts with our customers, and excludes taxes collected from customers subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. We recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied over time as the services are performed or at a point in time depending on the nature of the services provided as further discussed below. Revenue recognition guidance related to contracts with customers excludes our NII, revenue earned on security lending transactions entered into as principal, realized gains/losses on securities, revenue earned on foreign exchange activity, loans and related fees, and gains/losses on hedging and derivatives, to which we apply other applicable U.S. GAAP guidance.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, or contracts that have been combined, we allocate the contracts' transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price. Our contractual fees are negotiated on a customer by customer basis and are representative of standalone selling price utilized for allocating revenue when there are multiple performance obligations.\nSubstantially all of our services are provided as a distinct series of daily performance obligations that the customer simultaneously benefits from as they are performed. Payments may be made to third party service providers and the expense is recognized gross when we control those services as we are deemed the principal.\nContract durations may vary from short to long- term or may be open ended. Termination notice periods are in line with general market practice and typically do not include termination penalties. Therefore, for substantially all of our revenues, the duration of the contract and the enforceable rights and obligations do not extend beyond the services that are performed daily or at the transaction level. In instances where we have substantive termination penalties, the duration of the contract may extend through the date of substantive termination penalties.\nInvestment Servicing\nRevenue from contracts with customers related to servicing fees is recognized over time as our customers benefit from the custody, administration, accounting, transfer agency and other related asset services as they are performed. At contract inception, no revenue is estimated as the fees are dependent on assets under custody and/or administration and/or actual transactions which are susceptible to market factors outside of our control. Therefore, revenue is recognized using a time-based output method as the customers benefit from the services over time and as the assets under custody or transactions are known or determinable during each reporting period based on contractual fee schedules. Payments made to third party service providers, such as sub-custodians, are generally recognized gross as we control those services and are deemed to be a principal in such arrangements.\nForeign exchange trading services revenue includes revenue generated from providing access and use of electronic trading platforms and other trading, transition management and brokerage services. Electronic FX services are dependent on the volume of actual transactions initiated through our electronic exchange platforms. Revenue is recognized over time using a time-based measure as access to, and use of, the electronic exchange platforms is made available to the customer and the activity is determinable. Revenue related to other trading, transition management and brokerage services is recognized when the customer obtains the benefit of such services which may be over time or at a point in time upon trade execution.\nSecurities finance revenue is related to services for providing agency lending programs to State Street Global Advisors managed investment funds and third- party investment managers and asset owners. This securities finance revenue is recognized over time using a time-based measure as our customers benefit from these lending services over time.\nRevenue related to the front office solutions provided by CRD is primarily driven by the sale of licenses and software as service arrangements, including professional services such as consulting and implementation services, software support and maintenance. Revenue for a sale of software to be installed on premise is recognized at a point in time when the customer benefits from obtaining access to and use of the software license. Revenue for a SaaS related arrangement is recognized over time as services are provided.\nInvestment Management\nRevenue from contracts with customers related to investment management, investment research and investment advisory services provided through State Street Global Advisors is recognized over time as our customers benefit from the services as they are performed. Substantially all of our investment management fees are determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategies employed. At contract inception, no revenue is estimated as the fees are dependent on assets under management which are susceptible to market factors outside of our control.\nState Street Corporation | 184\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTherefore, substantially all of our Investment Management services revenue is recognized using a time-based output method as the customers benefit from the services over time and as the assets under management are known or determinable during each reporting period based on contractual fee schedules. Payments made to third party service providers, such as payments to others in unitary fee arrangements, are generally recognized on a gross basis when State Street Global Advisors controls those services and is deemed to be a principal in such transactions.\nRevenue by category\nIn the following table, revenue is disaggregated by our\ntwo\nlines of business and by revenue stream for which the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The amounts in the \"Other\" columns were not allocated to our business lines.\nContract balances and contract costs\nA\ns of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, net receivables of $\n2.68\nbillion and $\n2.77\nbillion, respectively, are included in accrued interest and fees receivable, representing amounts billed or currently billable related to revenue from contracts with customers. As performance obligations are satisfied, we have an unconditional right to payment and billing is generally performed monthly; therefore, we do not have significant contract assets or liabilities.\nState Street Corporation | 185\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNo adjustments are made to the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component as the period between when we transfer a promised service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service is expected to be one year or less.\nNote 26.\nNon-U.S. Activities\nWe define our non-U.S. activities as those revenue-producing business activities that arise from clients which are generally serviced or managed outside the U.S. Due to the integrated nature of our business, precise segregation of our U.S. and non-U.S. activities is not possible.\nSubjective estimates, assumptions and other judgments are applied to quantify the financial results and assets related to our non-U.S. activities, including our application of funds transfer pricing, our asset and liability management policies and our allocation of certain indirect corporate expenses. Management periodically reviews and updates its processes for quantifying the financial results and assets related to our non-U.S. activities.\nThe following table presents our U.S. and non-U.S. financial results for the periods indicated:\n(1)\nGeographic mix is generally based on the domicile of the entity servicing the funds and is not necessarily representative of the underlying asset mix.\nNon-U.S. assets were $\n111.30\nbillion and $\n83.28\nbillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNote 27.\nParent Company Financial Statements\nThe following tables present the financial statements of the Parent Company without consolidation of its banking and non-banking subsidiaries, as of and for the years indicated:\nStatement of Income - Parent Company\nState Street Corporation | 186\nSTATE STREET CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nStatement of Condition - Parent Company\nStatement of Cash Flows - Parent Company\nNote 28.\nSubsequent Events\nOn January 14, 2021, we announced that we will redeem on March 15, 2021 an aggregate of $\n500\nmillion, or\n5,000\nof the\n7,500\noutstanding shares of our non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series F, for cash at a redemption price of $\n100,000\nper share (equivalent to $\n1,000\nper depositary share) plus all declared and unpaid dividends. A cash dividend of $\n953.38\nper share of Series F Preferred Stock (or approximately $\n9.5338\nper depositary share) has been declared for the period from December 15, 2020 up to but not including March 15, 2021 (the “March Dividend”). The March Dividend will be paid separately to the holders of record of the Series F Preferred Stock as of March 1, 2021 in the customary manner. Accordingly, there will not be any declared and unpaid dividends included in the redemption price\n.\nState Street Corporation | 187\nSTATISTICAL DISCLOSURE BY BANK HOLDING COMPANIES\nDistribution of Average Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity; Interest Rates and Interest Differential (Unaudited)\nThe following table presents consolidated average statements of condition and NII for the years indicated:\n(1)\nFully taxable-equivalent revenue is a method of presentation in which the tax savings achieved by investing in tax-exempt investment securities and certain leases are included in interest income with a corresponding charge to income tax expense. This method facilitates the comparison of the performance of these assets. The adjustments are computed using a federal income tax rate of\n21\n% for periods ending in 2018, 2019 and 2020, adjusted for applicable state income taxes, net of the related federal tax benefit. The fully taxable-equivalent adjustments included in interest income presented above were $17 million, $19 million and $57 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and were substantially related to tax-exempt securities (state and political subdivisions).\n(2)\nNon-U.S. non-interest-bearing deposits were $784 million, $820 million and $1,165 million as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(3)\nNIM is calculated by dividing fully taxable-equivalent NII by average total interest-earning assets.\nState Street Corporation | 188\nSTATISTICAL DISCLOSURE BY BANK HOLDING COMPANIES (CONTINUED)\nThe following table summarizes changes in fully taxable-equivalent interest income and interest expense due to changes in volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and due to changes in interest rates. Changes attributed to both volumes and rates have been allocated based on the proportion of change in each category.\nQuarterly Summarized Financial Information (Unaudited)\n(1)\nBasic and diluted earnings per common share for full-year 2020 and basic earnings per common share for full-year 2019 do not equal the sum of the four quarters for the year.\nState Street Corporation | 189\n(1)\nAs defined by the applicable U.S. regulations.\nState Street Corporation | 190\nState Street Corporation | 191"

For the year ended December 31, 2020, State Street's management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of State Street's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that State Street's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020.\nState Street has also established and maintains internal control over financial reporting as a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in conformity with U.S. GAAP. In the ordinary course of business, State Street routinely enhances its internal controls and procedures for financial reporting by either upgrading its current systems or implementing new systems. Changes have been made and may be made to State Street's internal controls and procedures for financial reporting as a result of these efforts. During the quarter ended December 31, 2020, no change occurred in State Street's internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, State Street's internal control over financial reporting.\nState Street Corporation | 192\nINTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of State Street is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.\nState Street’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. State Street’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of State Street; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of State Street are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of State Street; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of State Street’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of State Street’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013).\nBased on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, State Street’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nThe effectiveness of State Street’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report, which follows this report.\nState Street Corporation | 193\nReport of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of State Street Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited State Street Corporation’s (the “Corporation”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the 2020 consolidated financial statements of the Corporation and our report dated February 19, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 19, 2021\nState Street Corporation | 194"

The table provides this information separately for equity compensation plans that have and have not been approved by shareholders. Shares presented in the table and in the footnotes following the table are stated in thousands of shares.\n(1)\nExcludes deferred stock awards and performance awards for which there is no exercise price.\n(2)\nConsists of 5,686 thousand shares subject to deferred stock awards, zero shares subject to stock options, zero stock appreciation rights and 2,517 thousand shares subject to performance awards (assuming payout at 100% for all awards, including awards for which performance is uncertain).\n(3)\nConsists of shares subject to deferred stock awards.\nIndividual directors who are not our employees have received stock awards and cash retainers, both of which may be deferred. Directors may elect to receive shares of our common stock in place of cash. If payment is in the form of common stock, the number of shares is determined by dividing the approved cash amount by the closing price on the date of the annual shareholders' meeting or date of grant, if different. All deferred shares, whether stock awards or common stock received in place of cash retainers, are increased to reflect dividends paid on the common stock and, for certain directors, may include share amounts in respect of an accrual under a terminated retirement plan.\nState Street Corporation | 195\nPursuant to State Street’s Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, non-employee directors may elect to defer the receipt of 0% or 100% of their (1) retainers, (2) meeting fees or (3) annual equity grant award. Non-employee directors also may elect to receive their retainers in cash or shares of common stock. Non-employee directors who elect to defer the cash payment of their retainers or meeting fees may choose from four notional investment fund returns for such deferred cash. Deferrals of common stock are adjusted to reflect the hypothetical reinvestment in additional shares of common stock for any dividends or distributions on State Street common stock. Deferred amounts will be paid (a) as elected by the non-employee director, on either the date of their termination of service on the Board or on the earlier of such termination and a future date specified, and (b) in the form elected by the non-employee director as either a lump sum or in installments over a two- to five-year period.\nStock awards totaling 209,937 shares of common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2020; awards made through June 30, 2003, totaling 18,324 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020, have not been approved by shareholders. There are no other equity compensation plans under which our equity securities are authorized for issuance that have been adopted without shareholder approval. Awards of stock made or retainer shares paid to individual directors after June 30, 2003 have been or will be made under our 1997, 2006 or 2017 Equity Incentive Plan,  which were approved by shareholders."
