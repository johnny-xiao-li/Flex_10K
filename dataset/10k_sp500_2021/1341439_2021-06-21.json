    "text": "Oracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) environments. Our products and services include applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise deployments, cloud-based deployments, and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployment) such as our Oracle Cloud@Customer offering (an instance of Oracle Cloud in a customer’s own data center). Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force and indirectly through the Oracle Partner Network. Using Oracle technologies, our customers build, deploy, run, manage and support their internal and external products, services and business operations including, for example, a global cloud application supplier that utilizes Oracle Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) to provide its Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings; a multi-national financial institution that runs its banking applications using the Oracle Exadata Database Machine; and a global consumer products company that leverages Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning for its accounting processes, consolidation and financial planning functions.\nOracle Cloud Services offerings, which include Oracle SaaS and Oracle IaaS offerings, provide a comprehensive and integrated stack of applications and infrastructure services delivered via cloud-based deployment models. Oracle Cloud Services integrate the software, hardware and services on a customer’s behalf in a cloud-based IT environment that Oracle deploys, upgrades, supports and manages for the customer.\nOracle Cloud Services are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; intuitive for casual and experienced users; easily maintainable to reduce upgrade, integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interchangeability and extendibility between IT environments; compatible to easily move workloads between the Oracle Cloud and other IT environments; cost-effective by requiring lower upfront customer investment; and secure, standards-based and reliable.\nOracle cloud license and on-premise license deployment offerings include Oracle Applications, Oracle Database and Oracle Middleware software offerings, among others, which customers deploy using IT infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially all customers, at their option, purchase license support contracts when they purchase an Oracle license.\nOracle hardware products include Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage and industry-specific products, among others. Customers generally opt to purchase hardware support contracts when they purchase Oracle hardware products.\nOracle also offers services to assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their Oracle purchases.\nProviding choice and flexibility to Oracle customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and better addresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewer offerings, more restrictive deployment models and less flexibility for a customer’s transition to cloud-based IT environments.\nOur investments in, and innovation with respect to, Oracle products and services that we offer through our three businesses (cloud and license, hardware and services businesses, described further below) are another important element of our corporate strategy. In fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, we invested $6.5 billion, $6.1 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of offerings and products and to develop new technologies and services. We have a deep understanding as to how applications and infrastructure technologies interact and function with one another. We focus our development efforts on improving the performance, security, operation, integration and cost-effectiveness of our offerings relative to our competitors; facilitating the ease with which organizations are able to deploy, use, manage and maintain our offerings; and incorporating emerging technologies within our offerings to enable leaner business processes,\n3\nautomation and innovation. For example, the Oracle Autonomous Database is designed to deliver transformational infrastructure through an Oracle Cloud IaaS offering that utilizes Oracle’s Next-Generation Cloud Infrastructure’s machine learning capabilities. After an initial purchase of Oracle products and services, our customers can continue to benefit from our offerings, research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support offerings for their license and hardware deployments, which may include product enhancements that we periodically deliver to our products, and by renewing their Oracle Cloud Services contracts with us\n.\nOur selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide greater scale to accelerate innovation, grow our revenues and earnings, and increase stockholder value. We have invested billions of dollars over time to acquire a number of companies, products, services and technologies that add to, are complementary to, or have otherwise enhanced our existing offerings. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy.\nWe have three businesses, each of which is comprised of a single operating segment. Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, both included elsewhere in this Annual Report, provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments.\nOracle Corporation was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.\nImpacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Oracle’s Business\nOracle is committed to the health, safety and welfare of our employees, customers, suppliers, communities, stockholders and other stakeholders. While the world continues to navigate the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we are committed to providing critical technologies, programs and support to individuals and organizations to navigate, adjust and advance their operations in light of the unique demands and constraints imposed by the pandemic. Many enterprises, governments and educational institutions have faced unprecedented disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic and their customers expect to deal with organizations in digital ways more than ever before. Organizations have been required to adjust their operations and IT infrastructures to operate safely while agilely responding to evolving purchaser needs and business requirements. Organizations have turned to the Oracle Cloud to accelerate their digital transformations using applications and infrastructure technologies that are designed to be complete, current, and robust in order to safely and securely operate, safeguard and advance their business initiatives. Regardless of IT deployment model, Oracle has developed, delivered and supported products and services for decades that enable telecommunication companies to keep people connected; retailers to provide food and other necessities; researchers to identify solutions; hospitals to provide care; airlines to ensure travel; banks to help people access funds; insurers to provide benefits; governments to keep people safe and informed; utilities to supply power and water; and many other critical functions.\nWe have proactively sought, supported, donated to, partnered and engaged with organizations globally that provide critical medicines, research, goods and services to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, including:\n4\namong dozens of other specific use cases, programs and partnerships that Oracle has donated to, partnered with, developed and supported in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOracle applications and infrastructure technologies are critical to the business operations of our customers, which number in the hundreds of thousands across a broad geographic and industry base. We are profitable and generate a large amount of positive cash flow from our operations and we do not believe the COVID-19 pandemic will jeopardize either of these characteristics of our business. Other impacts due to COVID-19 on our business are currently unknown.\nFor additional discussion regarding the impacts and risks to our business from the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors and Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOracle Applications and Infrastructure Technologies\nOracle’s comprehensive portfolio of applications and infrastructure technologies is designed to address an organization’s IT environment needs including business process, infrastructure and applications development requirements, among others.

We endeavor to hire employees from a broad pool of talent with diverse backgrounds, perspectives and abilities and we believe Oracle’s diverse leaders serve as role models for our inclusive workforce. We seek to continuously build on our inclusive hiring strategies, tracking our progress and holding ourselves accountable for greater diversity at Oracle. Our programs are supported by Oracle leaders across the company with strategic sponsorship from Oracle’s Executive Diversity Council, which is led by Safra Catz, our Chief Executive Officer, and extend through the actions we are taking globally on Oracle’s five Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Imperatives:\nIn addition to global, regional and local programs, Oracle Human Resources partners with business leaders to create and implement D&I plans to embed targeted strategies into organizations across Oracle. Employee satisfaction on the importance of D&I at Oracle and their manager’s encouragement of diverse ideas and perspectives ranks high in our employee engagement surveys.\nLeaders Who Listen\nWe believe that an important aspect of creating a culture and environment that supports employee and business success is listening to employee feedback. We share the results of our annual employee engagement survey with leaders who receive direct observations from employees about areas critical to Oracle’s strategic priorities, including the employee and customer experience. Nearly 80% of our employees participate in the annual survey.\n14\nLeaders listen to employees, evaluate feedback and prioritize actions to enhance employee, business and customer success\n.\nFlexible Work Options\nThe COVID-19 pandemic changed the way both leaders and employees think about where and how they work. For the vast majority of Oracle’s employees, productivity is no longer tied to being in an office and collaboration can happen between people anywhere. In fiscal 2021 we announced a modern approach to work that gives our employees more flexibility to choose where and how to work. Depending on their role, this means that when our offices reopen after the pandemic, many employees can choose their office location, as well as continue to work from home some or all the time. We expect this modern approach to work will help us engage with a wider pool of talent and retain employees who want or need more flexibility.\nTenure\nWe monitor employee turnover rates as our success depends upon retaining top talent. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed decreased turnover in the short term and we believe that in the long term, we have an opportunity to continue to reduce undesirable turnover by offering competitive rewards, flexible work options, career growth and development opportunities. The average tenure of our employees is approximately eight years and 29% of our employees have been employed with Oracle for ten or more years.\nOpportunities to Learn and Grow\nWe believe that a primary reason candidates join Oracle is for career development opportunities. We have programs and resources to help our employees explore, build and achieve their career goals. We also promote regular career conversations between leaders and employees. These are separate from performance feedback conversations and are focused on helping employees identify and take steps to grow their careers. Our Talent Review process, run on Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM, provides the mechanism for leaders to review and discuss opportunities and action plans to develop employees. 31% of our open non-entry level positions were filled internally in fiscal 2021, providing growth opportunities and retaining critical knowledge and talent.\nHelping our employees learn and apply new skills is key to retaining them and critical to our ability to innovate and rapidly evolve. We support employees with anytime, everywhere learning resources to help build skills for today and the future. Oracle employees received four million hours of training in fiscal 2021 and accessed online learning content at an average rate of more than two million views per month. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, we implemented a global work from home program and immediately pivoted to enable employees to continue learning from home. We moved in-person learning and development to online and our employees took advantage of the rich content available to help them enhance their skills. In addition to online classes and learning resources on business and technical skills, we also added more webinars and learning opportunities to support employee and family well-being.\nMaking a Difference\nMany of our employees participate in Oracle’s corporate citizenship initiatives focused on education, the environment and community. Each year, through our volunteering and giving programs, employees donate tens of thousands of volunteer hours and millions of dollars (matched by Oracle) to causes ranging from equality and racial justice, to cleaning up oceans and mentoring students, to sharing their time and resources with people in need.\nSeasonality and Cyclicality\nOur quarterly revenues have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors, including the structure of our sales force incentive compensation plans, which are common in the IT industry. In each fiscal year, our total revenues and operating margins are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. The operating margins of our businesses (in particular, our cloud and license business and hardware business) are generally affected by seasonal factors in a similar manner as our revenues because certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term. See “Cloud and License Business” in Item 7 of this\n15\nAnnual Report for more information regarding the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenues, expenses and margins\n.\nCompetition\nWe face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as customer demands and competitive pressures otherwise change.\nOur customers are demanding less complexity and lower total cost in the implementation, sourcing, integration and ongoing maintenance of their IT environments. Our enterprise cloud, license and hardware offerings compete directly with certain offerings from some of the largest and most competitive companies in the world, including Amazon.com, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Intel Corporation, Cisco Systems, Inc., Adobe Systems Incorporated, Alphabet Inc. and SAP SE, as well as other companies like Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, salesforce.com, inc. and Workday, Inc. In addition, due to the low barriers to entry in many of our market segments, new technologies and new and growing competitors frequently emerge to challenge our offerings. Our competitors range from companies offering broad IT solutions across many of our lines of business to vendors providing point solutions, or offerings focused on a specific functionality, product area or industry. In addition, as we expand into new market segments, we face increased competition as we compete with existing competitors, as well as firms that may be partners in other areas of our business and other firms with whom we have not previously competed. Moreover, we or our competitors may take certain strategic actions—including acquisitions, partnerships and joint ventures, or repositioning of product lines—which invite even greater competition in one or more product offering categories.\nKey competitive factors in each of the segments in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include: total cost of ownership, performance, scalability, reliability, security, functionality, efficiency, ease of use, speed to production and quality of technical support. Our products and services sales and the relative strength of our products and services versus those of our competitors are also directly and indirectly affected by the following, among other factors:\nFor more information about the competitive risks we face, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nGovernmental Regulation\nWe operate globally and are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. For information about governmental regulations applicable to our business, refer to Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, both included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n16\nAvailable Information\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available, free of charge, on the SEC website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such materials with, or furnish them to, the SEC.

    "text": "We operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. The following discussion, as well as our “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussion in Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, highlights some of these risks. The risks described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected how we and our customers are operating our respective businesses, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations remains uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread have materially affected how we, our customers, partners and suppliers are operating our businesses. Our operations have been negatively affected by a range of external factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are not within our control. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has led governments to implement preventative measures to contain or control further spread of the virus, such as travel restrictions, prohibitions of non-essential activities, quarantines, work-from-home directives and shelter-in-place orders. These preventative measures led to sharp reductions in demand in certain industries in which our customers operate. It is not clear what long-term effects the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, including the effects on our customers and prospects. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic effectively, our business will be harmed.\nDuring fiscal 2021, we cancelled some customer events and transformed others, including Oracle OpenWorld, to virtual events. Our shift to creating virtual customer events may not be successful and we may not be able to showcase our products as well as we have historically done through in-person events, or generate the same customer interest, opportunities and leads through these virtual events. If we attempt to reintroduce large in-person events, we may not be able to do so successfully and our customers may not be able or willing to attend them.\nThe conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic initially adversely affected our customers’ willingness to purchase our products, delayed prospective customers’ purchasing decisions and in certain cases, resulted in delayed payments by existing customers. There have also been, and likely will continue to be, delays in our supply chain. The negative impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the broader global economy and related impacts on our customers’ business operations and their demand for our products may continue into future fiscal periods. The COVID-19 pandemic may also heighten other risks described in this Risk Factors section.\nOur success depends upon our ability to develop new products and services, integrate acquired products and services and enhance our existing products and services.\nRapid technological advances, intense competition, changing delivery models and evolving standards in computer hardware and software development and communications infrastructure, changing and increasingly sophisticated customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the industries in which we compete. If we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated products and services, enhance and improve our product offerings and support services in a timely manner or position and price our products and services to meet demand, customers may not purchase or subscribe to our license, hardware or cloud offerings or renew license support, hardware support or cloud subscriptions contracts. Renewals of these contracts are important to the growth of our business. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that the standards on which we choose to develop new products will allow us to compete effectively for business opportunities in emerging areas.\nWe have continued to refresh and release new offerings of our cloud products and services. Machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly driving innovations in technology but if they fail to operate as anticipated or our other products do not perform as promised, our business and reputation may be harmed.\nIn addition, our business may be adversely affected if:\n18\nOur Oracle Cloud strategy, including our Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (SaaS and IaaS, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings, may adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe provide our cloud and other offerings to customers worldwide via deployment models that best suit their needs, including via our cloud-based SaaS and IaaS offerings. As these business models continue to evolve, we may not be able to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain the profitability of our cloud offerings. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud and SaaS delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our cloud and license offerings. If we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing needs of our customers, our reputation as a cloud services provider could be harmed and our revenues and profitability could decline.\nAs customer demand for our cloud offerings increases, we experience volatility in our reported revenues and operating results due to the differences in timing of revenue recognition between our cloud license and on-premise license, and hardware product arrangements relative to our cloud offering arrangements. Customers generally purchase our cloud offerings on a subscription basis and revenues from these offerings are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the subscriptions. Consequently, any deterioration in sales activity associated with our cloud offerings may not be immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operations. This is in contrast to revenues associated with our license and hardware product arrangements, which are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related licenses and hardware products. In addition, we may not be able to accurately anticipate customer transition from or be able to sufficiently backfill reduced customer demand for our license, hardware and support offerings relative to the expected increase in customer adoption of and demand for our Oracle Cloud Services, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability\n.\nWe might experience significant coding, manufacturing or configuration errors in our cloud, license and hardware offerings.\nDespite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, our cloud, license and hardware offerings sometimes contain coding, manufacturing or configuration errors that can impact their function, performance and security, and result in other negative consequences. The detection and correction of any errors in released cloud, license or hardware offerings can be time consuming and costly. Errors in our cloud, license or hardware offerings could affect their ability to properly function, integrate or operate with other cloud, license or hardware offerings, could result in service interruptions, delays or outages of our cloud offerings, could create security vulnerabilities in our products or services, could delay the development or release of new products or services or new versions of products or services, and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products or services. This includes third-party software products or services incorporated into our own. If we experience any of these errors, or if there are delays in releasing our cloud, license or hardware offerings or new versions of these offerings, our sales could be affected and revenues could decline. In addition, we run Oracle’s business operations as well as cloud and other services that we offer to our customers on our products and networks. Therefore, any flaws could affect our and our customers’ abilities to conduct business operations and to ensure accuracy in financial processes and reporting, and may result in unanticipated costs. Enterprise customers rely on our cloud, license and hardware offerings and related services to run their businesses and errors in our cloud, license and hardware offerings and related services could expose us to product liability, performance and warranty claims as well as significant harm to our brand and reputation, which could impact our future sales.\n19\nIf we are unable to compete effectively, the results of operations and prospects for our business could be harmed\n.\nWe face intense competition in all aspects of our business. The nature of the IT industry creates a competitive landscape that is constantly evolving as firms emerge, expand or are acquired, as technology evolves and as delivery models change. Many vendors spend amounts in excess of what Oracle spends to develop and market applications and infrastructure technologies including databases, middleware products, application development tools, business applications, collaboration products and business intelligence, compute, storage and networking products, among others, which compete with Oracle applications and infrastructure offerings. Use of our competitors’ technologies influences a customer’s purchasing decision or creates an environment that makes it less efficient to utilize or migrate to Oracle products and services. Our competitors may also adopt business practices that provide customers access to competing products and services at a risk profile that we may not generally find acceptable, which may convince customers to purchase competitor products and services. We could lose customers if our competitors introduce new competitive products, add new functionality, acquire competitive products, reduce prices, better execute on their sales and marketing strategies, offer more flexible business practices or form strategic alliances with other companies. Mergers, consolidations or alliances among our competitors, or acquisitions of our competitors by large companies, may result in increased competition. We may also face increasing competition from open source software initiatives in which competitors may provide software and intellectual property for free. Existing or new competitors could gain sales opportunities or customers at our expense\n.\nWe may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully.\nThe intense competition we face in the sales of our products and services and general economic and business conditions could put pressure on us to change our prices. If our competitors offer deep discounts on certain products or services or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices, introduce pricing models and offerings that are less favorable to us, or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully. Any such changes may reduce revenues and margins and could adversely affect operating results. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery models offered by us and our competitors may unfavorably impact the pricing of our other cloud and license, hardware and services offerings, and we may also incur increased cloud delivery expenses as we expand our cloud operations and update our infrastructure, all of which could reduce our revenues and/or profitability. Our license support fees and hardware support fees are generally priced as a percentage of our net license fees and net new hardware products fees, respectively. Our competitors may offer lower pricing on their support offerings, which could put pressure on us to further discount our offerings.\nChanges to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as our sales force implements and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies. Some of our competitors may bundle products for promotional purposes or as a long-term pricing strategy, commit to large customer deployments at prices that are unprofitable, or provide guarantees of prices and product implementations. These practices could, over time, significantly constrain the prices that we can charge for certain of our products. If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand, our revenues could decrease. The increase in open source software distribution may also cause us to change our pricing models.\nAny failure to offer high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results\n.   Our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications and infrastructure offerings. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services or may be inefficient in our resolution of customer support issues. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality technical support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell and renew our applications and infrastructure offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results, and financial position.\nOur cloud offerings and hardware offerings are complex, and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity, the results of these businesses will suffer.\nWe depend on suppliers to develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products that we market and sell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver our cloud offerings, and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology,\n20\navailability or other business constraints. As a result, our supply chain operations could be disrupted or negatively impacted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages, natural disasters, political unrest, public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, changes to trade policies, port stoppages or other transportation disruptions or slowdowns, or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped. We may be unable to purchase these items from the respective single vendors on acceptable terms or may experience significant shortages, delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary technologies, parts or components from a particular vendor. If one or more of the risks described above occurs, our cloud and license business and hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected\n.\nWe are susceptible to third-party manufacturing and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and customers.\nWe outsource a significant majority of our manufacturing, assembly, delivery and technology of, and certain component designs for, our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the U.S. From time to time, these partners experience production problems or delays or cannot meet our demand for products. To reduce this risk, we continue to explore additional third-party manufacturing partners to drive supply chain continuity, but finding additional manufacturing sources in a timely and cost-effective manner is difficult. Third-party manufacturing and logistics delays attributable to the effects of COVID-19 caused a loss of sales during our fiscal 2021. Ongoing or future delays in manufacturing could cause the loss of additional sales, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses, all of which could adversely affect the margins of our cloud and license business and hardware business. These challenges could arise if we alter our manufacturing strategies, suppliers, or locations.\nOur hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline.\nOur hardware business may adversely affect our total revenues and overall profitability and related growth rates. We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors, including:\nOur periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations can be disruptive.\nWe are currently restructuring our workforce and in the past we have restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, change in strategies, acquisitions and other internal and external considerations. These types of restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring costs and temporary reduced productivity while the employees adjusted to their new roles and responsibilities. In addition, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, resource redeployment or cost savings benefits of these\n21\nrestructurings, or may not do so within the expected timeframe. These effects could recur in connection with future acquisitions and other restructurings and our revenues and other results of operations could be negatively affected\n.\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire enough qualified employees.\nWe rely on hiring qualified employees and the continued service of our senior management, including our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Technology Officer and founder; our Chief Executive Officer; other members of our executive team; and other key employees. In the technology industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business, product development, technical and other personnel. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to ensure the safety of our employees, we have temporarily closed the majority of our offices. In fiscal 2021, we moved our headquarters to Austin, Texas and announced a modern approach to work that may provide our employees more flexibility to choose where and how to work. Depending on their role, this means that, when our offices reopen after the COVID-19 pandemic, many employees can choose their office location, as well as continue to work from home some or all the time. While we believe this may help us engage with a wider pool of talent and may help to retain employees who want or need more flexibility, it could negatively impact employee productivity and it may present risks for our real estate portfolio and strategy. We intend to reopen our offices when it is safe to do so and local requirements allow, but our employees who opt to return to the office may nevertheless be exposed to health risks, which may expose us to potential liability.\nWe may also experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sales. We may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel. With rare exceptions, we do not have long-term employment or non-competition agreements with our employees. Members of our senior management team have left Oracle over the years for a variety of reasons, and we cannot guarantee that there will not be additional departures, which may be disruptive to our operations.\nWe continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lower costs. When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure. We may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues, which may affect our employee retention efforts and increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program. In addition, changes to immigration and labor law policies may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent.\nOur general compensation program includes restricted stock units and performance-based equity, which are important tools in attracting and retaining employees in our industry. If our stock price performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees. We continually evaluate our compensation practices and consider changes from time to time, such as reducing the number of employees granted equity awards or the number of equity awards granted per employee and granting alternative forms of stock-based compensation, which may have an impact on our ability to retain employees and the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record. Any changes in our compensation practices or those of our competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.\nOur cloud and license, and hardware indirect sales channels could affect our future operating results.\nOur cloud and license, and hardware indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers, system integrators/implementers, consultants, education providers, internet service providers, network integrators and independent software vendors. Our relationships with these channel participants are important elements of our cloud, software and hardware marketing and sales efforts. Our financial results could be adversely affected if our contracts with channel participants were terminated, if our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate, if any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant, if the financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken or if the level of demand for our channel participants’ products and services were to decrease. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues.\n22\nAcquisitions present many risks and we may not achieve the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction\n.\nWe continue to review and consider strategic acquisitions of companies, products, services and technologies. We have a selective and active acquisition program and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future because acquisitions have been an important element of our overall corporate strategy. Risks we may face in connection with our\nacquisition program include\n:\n23\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisitions.\nData Privacy, Security and Intellectual Property Risks\nIf our security measures for our products and services are compromised and as a result, our data, our customers’ data or our IT systems are accessed improperly, made unavailable, or improperly modified, our products and services may be perceived as vulnerable, our brand and reputation could be damaged, the IT services we provide to our customers could be disrupted, and customers may stop using our products and services, any of which could reduce our revenue and earnings, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions.\nOur products and services, including Oracle Cloud Services, store, retrieve, manipulate and manage third-party data, such as our customers’ information and data, as well as our own data. We have a reputation for secure and reliable product offerings and related services, and we have invested a great deal of time and resources in protecting the integrity and security of our products, services and the internal and external data that we manage. Nonetheless, we believe that Oracle in particular is an attractive target for computer hackers and other bad actors because Oracle stores and processes large amounts of data, including in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data such as health sciences, financial services, retail, hospitality and the government.  We and our third-party vendors are regularly subject to attempts by third parties (which may include individuals or groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, such as state-sponsored organizations, nation states and individuals sponsored by them) to identify and exploit product and service vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our security measures, and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers’, partners’ and suppliers’ software, hardware and cloud offerings, networks and systems. Successful attempts by one of these malicious actors can lead to the compromise of personal information or the confidential information or data of Oracle or our customers. Attempts of this nature typically involve IT-related viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack networks, systems, products and services, exploit potential security vulnerabilities of networks, systems, products and services, create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce customers, partners, employees or suppliers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data, our customers’, suppliers’ or partners’ data or the IT systems of Oracle, our customers, suppliers or partners.  Our products and services, including our Oracle Cloud Services, may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of customer, partner, employee, contractor or supplier error or malfeasance.\nIf a cyber-attack or other security incident results in unauthorized access to or modification of our customers’ or suppliers’ data, other external data, our own data or our IT systems, or if the services we provide to our customers are disrupted, or if our products or services are reported to have or are perceived as having security vulnerabilities, we could incur significant expenses and suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation. If our customers lose confidence in the security and reliability of our products and services, including our cloud offerings, and perceive them to not be secure, they may decide to reduce or terminate their spend with us. In addition, cyber-attacks and other security incidents could lead to significant investigation and remediation costs, loss or destruction of information, interruption of our operations, inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data, lawsuits, indemnity obligations, regulatory investigations and financial penalties, and claims and increased legal liability, including in some cases contractual costs related to customer notification and fraud monitoring. Our remediation efforts may not be successful. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or sabotage IT systems, change frequently, grow more complex over time, and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques. Our internal IT systems continue to evolve and we are often early adopters of new technologies. However, our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats\n24\nemerge. In addition, we often experience increased activity of this nature during times of instability, including during the current COVID-19\npandemic when most of our employees are working from home, and our operations may be more susceptible to malfeasance due to operational changes instituted to comply with safety, health and regulatory requirements, among others. We may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach\n.\nOur products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on a wide variety of third-party products, components and services. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, customer dissatisfaction, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. We also have an active acquisition program and have acquired a number of companies, products, services and technologies over the years. While we make significant efforts to address any IT security issues with respect to our acquired companies, we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these companies within Oracle.\nOur business practices with respect to data could give rise to operational interruption, liabilities or reputational harm as a result of governmental regulation, legal requirements or industry standards relating to privacy and data protection.\nAs regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and worldwide laws and regulations concerning the handling of personal information expand and become more complex, potential risks related to data collection and use within our business will intensify. In addition, U.S. and foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations, or may in the near future interpret existing legislation or regulations, in a manner that could significantly impact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners and data providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide.\nIn the wake of the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the rate of global consideration and adoption of privacy laws has increased, giving rise to more global jurisdictions in which regulatory inquiries and audits may be requested of Oracle, and if we are not deemed to be in compliance, could result in enforcement actions and/or fines. This is true in the U.S. where, for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) became effective in January 2020, the U.S. Congress is considering several privacy bills at the federal level, and other state legislatures are considering privacy laws. Regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations. The GDPR, which became effective in May 2018, provides for monetary penalties of up to 4% of an organization’s worldwide revenue. These penalties can be significant. For example, one European data protection regulator has fined a major U.S. technology company €50 million for its data handling practices. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission continues to fine companies on a regular basis for unfair and deceptive data protection practices, and these fines may increase in size. The CCPA provides for statutory damages or fines on a per violation basis that could be very large in the event of a significant data security breach or other CCPA violation. Taken together, the changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other types of data could greatly increase the size of potential fines related to data protection, and our cost of providing our products and services could result in changes to our business practices or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we have implemented contracts, diligence programs, policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, partners, suppliers, data providers or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our contracts, policies and procedures. Additionally, public perception and standards related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly, in ways that may affect our reputation or influence regulators to enact regulations and laws that may limit our ability to provide certain products and services.\nWe make statements about our use and disclosure of personal information through our privacy policy, information provided on our website and press statements. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with these public statements or with U.S. federal, state, or foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection, public perception, standards, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations, could result in lost or restricted business, proceedings, actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others, or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation.\n25\nThird parties have claimed, and in the future may claim, infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights and/or breach of license agreement provisions\n.\nWe periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. These third parties include entities that do not design, manufacture, or distribute products or services or that acquire intellectual property for the sole purpose of monetization through infringement assertions. We expect to continue to\nreceive such claims as\n:\nResponding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could:\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer our products or otherwise use our intellectual property. Our patents may be invalidated or circumvented. Any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued with the claim scope we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of intellectual property protection as U.S. laws and courts. If we cannot protect our intellectual property against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.\nWe may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all.\nDeveloping our various product offerings is expensive and the investment in the development of these offerings often involves a long return on investment cycle. An important element of our corporate strategy is to continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to research and development and related product and service opportunities both through internal investments and the acquisition of intellectual property from acquired companies. Accelerated product and service introductions and short lifecycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nAdverse litigation results could affect our business.\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings. Litigation can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations, and can divert our management’s attention away from running our core business. The results of our litigation also cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse decision\n26\ncould result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report\n.\nWe may be subjected to increased taxes due to changes in U.S. or international tax laws or from adverse resolutions of tax audits and controversies.\nAs a multinational corporation, we incur income taxes as well as non-income based taxes (such as payroll, sales, use, property and value-added taxes) in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant uncertainties exist with respect to the application of the various taxes to the businesses in which we engage, often requiring that we make judgments in determining our tax liabilities and worldwide provision for income taxes. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in the U.S. and internationally, which can lead to disagreements such as regarding our intercompany transfer prices and calculations and on the applicability of withholding taxes to our cross-border transactions. Any unfavorable resolution of these tax audits and controversies could cause our tax liabilities to increase and may have a significant adverse impact on our provision for income taxes and tax rate. Although we believe that our income and non-income based tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and tax accruals.\nIncreasingly, countries around the world are actively considering or have enacted changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations. In the U.S., various proposals, if enacted, would dramatically raise the U.S. corporate tax rate and increase the tax on non-U.S. income. Such unfavorable tax legislation resulting from the shifting U.S. political landscape and economic environment create the potential for added volatility in our quarterly provision for income taxes and could have a significant adverse impact on our future income tax provision and tax rate.\nOther countries also continue to consider changes to their tax laws that could negatively affect us by increasing taxes imposed on our international revenue streams, operations and cross-border transactions, including the imposition of taxes targeted at digital technology businesses and changes in withholding tax regimes. More fundamentally, longstanding international tax principles that determine each country’s right to tax cross-border transactions are being reconsidered, creating significant uncertainty as to the future level of corporate income tax on our international operations. This re-examination of the global tax system is driven by a perceived need to provide greater taxing rights to market jurisdictions where customers or users are located. Various measures are being discussed, including adjustments to the manner in which taxable profits are allocated among jurisdictions, as well as the limitation of deductions for, or the imposition of additional withholding taxes on, intercompany payments.\nThe foregoing proposals to raise U.S. corporate income taxes in combination with the uncertain international tax environment have upended the predictability and reliability of the global tax system. Our future income tax provision and tax rate could significantly increase if such tax law changes are enacted in the U.S. or in countries in which we do business. Our provision for income taxes also could be adversely affected by shifts of earnings from jurisdictions that have relatively lower statutory tax rates to those in which the rates are relatively higher. In addition, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities could negatively impact our income tax provision.\nOur international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the U.S. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, foreign currency-related regulations, competition regulations, anti-bribery laws and other laws prohibiting payments to governmental officials such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), market access regulations, tariffs, and import, export and general trade regulations, including but not limited to economic sanctions and embargos. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business, including the loss of trade privileges. Any such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, could delay or prevent potential acquisitions and could also\n27\nmaterially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.\nThese laws can require suspension or termination of business, including financial transactions, in certain countries, territories or with certain customers and any such action in the future could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance with these laws\nalso\nrequires a significant amount of management attention and effort, which may divert management’s attention from running our business operations and could harm our ability to grow our business, or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties. We monitor our operations and investigate allegations of improprieties relating to transactions and the way in which such transactions are recorded. Where circumstances warrant, we provide information and report our findings to government authorities, and in some circumstances such authorities conduct their own investigations and we respond to their requests or demands for information. No assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authorities or that our compliance program will prove effective.\nWe are also subject to a variety of other risks and challenges in managing an organization operating globally, including those related to:\nThe variety of risks and challenges listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact our supply chain operations and sales of our products and services in affected countries or regions.\nAs the majority shareholder of Oracle Financial Services Software Limited, a publicly traded company in India, and Oracle Corporation Japan, a publicly traded company in Japan, we are faced with several additional risks, including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control that we would otherwise have if these entities were wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nOur sales to government clients expose us to business volatility and risks, including government budgeting cycles and appropriations, procurement regulations, governmental policy shifts, early termination of contracts, audits,\n28\ninvestigations, sanctions and penalties\n.\nWe derive revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, state and local governments, and foreign governments and are subject to procurement laws relating to the award, administration and performance of those contracts\n.\nGovernmental entities are variously pursuing policies that affect our ability to sell our products and services. Changes in government procurement policy, priorities, regulations, technology initiatives and/or requirements may negatively impact our potential for growth in the government sector. For example, the U.S. government imposes evolving cybersecurity requirements, including, for example, the FedRAMP authorization process and the Department of Defense (DoD) Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC).  These requirements may impact our lines of business in the U.S. federal government market. Compliance with these cybersecurity requirements is complex and costly, and failure to meet, or delays in meeting, the required security controls could limit our ability to sell products and services, directly or indirectly, to the DoD and other federal and state government entities that implement similar cybersecurity requirements.\nWe are also subject to early termination of our contracts. Many governmental entities have the right to terminate contracts at any time, without cause. For example, the U.S. federal government may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts at its convenience, or for default based on our performance.\nU.S. federal, state and local government and foreign government contracts are generally subject to government funding authorizations/appropriations. Contracts may be terminated based upon a lack of government funds.\nThere is increased pressure on governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending as governments continue to face significant deficit reduction pressures. This may adversely impact spending on government programs.\nGovernment contracts laws and regulations impose certain risks, and contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations. If violations of law are found, they could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business.\nEnvironmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.\nSome of our cloud and hardware operations are subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and disposal of materials used for these products, human health and safety, the use of certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers, as well as local testing and labeling requirements. Compliance with these ever-changing environmental and other laws in a timely manner could increase our product design, development, procurement, manufacturing, delivery, cloud operations and administration costs, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, change our sales activities, or otherwise impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware businesses. Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of our cloud and hardware businesses. Regulatory, market, and competitive pressures regarding the greenhouse gas emissions and energy mix for our data center operations may also grow.\nA significant portion of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS), the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and China’s regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, among others, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU, China and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. The UK Government has announced a procurement policy that includes environmental, social and economic sustainability measures.\nThe SEC requires public disclosure for registrants that use certain “conflict minerals” in their products. Our supply chain is multi-tiered, global and highly complex. As a provider of hardware end-products, we are several steps removed from the mining and smelting or refining of any conflict minerals in our supply chain. Accordingly, our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of conflict minerals is limited.\n29\nWe have an Environmental Steering Committee (ESC) comprised of senior individuals from a wide range of Oracle business units, including our Chief Sustainability Officer who reports to our Chief Executive Officer and oversees our overall sustainability strategy, including climate related risk mitigation. The ESC evaluates if climate or environmental risks have the potential for significant chronic or acute impact on our core and/or strategic business functions, including service delivery and support, product development and deployment, supply chain management, facility operations, employee recruitment and retention, or brand reputation. A failure by the ESC to identify and assess these risks could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial performance and growth\n.\nWe publish an annual Corporate Citizenship Report, which includes disclosure of our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters and goals. Our disclosures on these matters, and standards we set for ourselves or a failure to meet these standards, may potentially harm our reputation and brand. By electing to set and share publicly these corporate ESG standards, our business may also face increased scrutiny related to ESG activities.\nFinancial Risks\nOur quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly based on a number of factors that make our results of operations difficult for us to predict.\nOur revenues, particularly certain of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues and hardware revenues, can be difficult to forecast. A substantial portion of our cloud license, on-premise license and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter, and a significant percentage of these is comprised of larger value orders. Because a significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term, sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability. The number of large license transactions and, to a lesser extent, hardware products transactions increases the risk of fluctuations in our quarterly results because a delay in even a small number of these transactions could cause our quarterly sales, revenues and profitability to fall significantly short of our predictions. In addition, sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity, such as what we experienced initially at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, may cause our sales forecasts to be inaccurate.\nWe may experience foreign currency gains and losses. Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect customer demand and our revenue and profitability.\nWe conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the values of major foreign currencies, particularly the Euro, Japanese Yen and British Pound, relative to the U.S. Dollar can significantly affect our total assets, revenues, operating results and cash flows, which are reported in U.S. Dollars. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, including the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and most other major international currencies, adversely affects our revenue growth in terms of the amounts that we report in U.S. Dollars after converting our foreign currency results into U.S. Dollars and in terms of actual demand for our products and services as certain of these products may become relatively more expensive for foreign currency-based enterprises to purchase. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S. Generally, our reported revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens. In addition, our reported assets generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as a portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposits, among other assets, are held in foreign currencies and reported in U.S. Dollars.\nIn addition, we incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to sublicense fees and other intercompany agreements among us and our subsidiaries that we expect to cash settle in the near term, which are charged to earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency exposures. We may suspend the program from time to time. As part of this program, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at least in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses. A large portion of our consolidated operations are international, and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost-effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures, if our hedging efforts are ineffective, or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program. Our ultimate realized\n30\nloss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and any related fees paid to purchase such contracts, and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows\n.\nWe have incurred foreign currency losses associated with the devaluation of currencies in certain highly inflationary economies relative to the U.S. Dollar. We could incur future losses in emerging market countries where we do business should their currencies become designated as highly inflationary.\nThere are risks associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness.\nAs of May 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of $84.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar year 2021 and calendar year 2061, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\nWe may also need to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing debt. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase.\nShould we incur future increases in interest expense, our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credits to reduce our U.S. federal income tax could be limited, which could unfavorably affect our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity securities and increase the interest amounts we pay on certain outstanding or future debt. These risks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value.\nAll of the factors discussed within this Risk Factors section could affect our stock price. The timing of announcements in the public market by us or by our competitors regarding new cloud services, products, product enhancements, technological advances, acquisitions or major transactions could also affect our stock price. Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends could affect our stock price. Our stock price could also be affected by factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, among others: speculation in the press, social media and the analyst community, changes in recommendations or earnings related estimates by financial analysts, changes in investors’ or analysts’ valuation measures for our stock, negative analyst surveys or channel check surveys, earnings announcements where our financial results differ from our guidance or investors’ expectations, our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance. The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.\nIn fiscal 2021, our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling $20.0 billion. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase a specified number or dollar value of shares. Our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and, even if fully implemented, may not enhance long-term stockholder value.\n31\nGeneral Risks\nEconomic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, which in turn could adversely affect our stock price.\nOur business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include:\nMacroeconomic developments such as the global economic effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Kingdom leaving the EU (Brexit), evolving trade policies between the U.S. and international trade partners, or the occurrence of similar events in other countries that lead to uncertainty or instability in economic, political or market conditions could negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and outlook, which, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price. Any general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce or eliminate their IT budgets and spending, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services.\nIn addition, international, regional or domestic political unrest and the related potential impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability. These factors generally have the strongest effect on our sales of cloud license and on-premise license, hardware and related services and, to a lesser extent, also may affect our renewal rates for license support and our subscription-based cloud offerings.\nBusiness disruptions could adversely affect our operating results.\nA significant portion of our critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas, some of which include emerging market international locations that may be less stable relative to running such business operations solely within the U.S. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems, supply chains and processes could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, including some of our cloud offerings, and enabling a seamless customer experience with respect to our customer facing back office processes. A major earthquake or fire, political, social or other disruption to infrastructure that supports our operations or other catastrophic event or the effects of climate change (such as increased storm severity, drought and pandemics) that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business, supply chains or IT systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected."

This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 can be found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on June 22, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor.\nBusiness Overview\nOracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) environments. Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise deployments, cloud‑based deployments, and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud‑based deployment) such as our Oracle Cloud@Customer offering (an instance of Oracle Cloud in a customer’s own data center). Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Through our worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network, we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers.\nWe have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part of this Item 7 and the information contained within Item 1 Business and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate resources.\nImpacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Oracle’s Business\nFor a discussion of the impacts on and risks to our business from COVID-19, please refer to “Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Oracle’s Business” included in Item 1 Business in this Annual Report, the risks included in Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report and the information presented below in “Results of Operations” in this Item 7.\nCloud and License Business\nOur cloud and license business, which represented 84% and 83% of our total revenues in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. Revenue streams included in our cloud and license business are:\n36\nProviding choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have introduced certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. The proportion of our cloud services and license support revenues relative to our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, hardware revenues and services revenues has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Cloud services and license support revenues represented 71%, 70% and 68% of our total revenues during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur cloud and license business’ revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings; the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base; substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases; the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; our ability to manage Oracle Cloud capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.\nOn a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to:\nWe believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business’ total revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development and our cloud operations to develop, improve, increase the capacity of and expand the geographic footprint of our cloud and license products and services.\n37\nOur\ncloud and license business’ margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably\nor based upon customer usage over the respective contractual terms\n; the renewal of existing customers’ cloud services and license support contracts over the course of each fiscal year that we generally recognize as revenues ratably; and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on\n-\npremise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery\n;\nin each case\nover those four quarterly periods\n.\nHardware Business\nOur hardware business, which represented 8% and 9% of our total revenues in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, provides a broad selection of enterprise hardware products and hardware-related software products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware offerings, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software, and related hardware support. Each hardware product and its related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. We expect to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products such as Oracle Solaris. Our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms.\nWe generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs.\nOur quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by many factors, including our manufacturing partners’ abilities to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions; our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings; customer demand for competing offerings, including cloud infrastructure offerings; the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts and the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available; and foreign currency rate fluctuations\n.\nServices Business\nOur services business, which represented 8% of our total revenues in each of fiscal 2021 and 2020, helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services and advanced customer services. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are affected by many factors including our strategy for, and the\n38\ncompetitive position of, our services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the\nassociated services for these offerings; general economic conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments; tighter controls over customer discretionary spending; and foreign currency rate fluctuations\n.\nAcquisitions\nOur selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. Historically, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. The pace of our acquisitions has slowed in recent years, but as compelling opportunities become available, we may acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provides additional information related to our recent acquisitions.\nWe believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flows and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. GAAP, as set forth within the ASC, requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include:\nOur senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Finance and Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report includes additional information about our critical and other accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe most critical judgments required in applying ASC 606,\nRevenue Recognition from Customers\n, and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligations and the evaluation of the standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation.\nMany of our customer contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple products and services\n39\ncontained within a customer contract are generally considered to be distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the transaction price for each customer contract to each performance\nobligation based on the relative SSP (the determination of SSP is discussed below) for each performance obligation within each contract. We recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within a customer contract as revenue as each performance obligation is delivered.\nWe use historical sales transaction data and judgment, among other factors, in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services, which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. SSP for our products and services can evolve over time due to changes in our pricing practices that are influenced by intense competition, changes in demand for our products and services, and economic factors, among others. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as substantially all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase the license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is generally determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues\n.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 805,\nBusiness Combinations\n(ASC 805), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of a business acquisition’s measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.\nAccounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies and any contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nFor a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts.\n40\nIf we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a non-income tax related pre-acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an\nasset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period or final determination of the net asset values for the business combination, whichever comes first, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position\n.\nIn addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets—Impairment Assessments\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.\nJudgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed.\nPerforming a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables.\nWe make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. In such situations, we are required to evaluate whether the net book values of our finite lived intangible assets are recoverable. We determine whether finite lived intangible assets are recoverable based upon the forecasted future cash flows that are expected to be generated by the lowest level associated asset grouping. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective and include, among others, forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be generated by certain asset groupings. These assumptions and estimates can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nJudgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities, the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment, and the segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made.\n41\nWe\nrecord a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located. We consider future growth, forecasted earnings,\nfuture taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, historical earnings, taxable income in prior years, if carryback is permitted under the law, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination, or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period. If we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to our provision for income taxes at such\ntime.\nWe\ncalculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which can materially impact our effective tax rate.\nThe amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgments. A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above.\nFor those tax related contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to ASC 740,\nIncome Taxes\n, which contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. A description of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time the accruals are made. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\n42\nResults of Operations\nPresentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information\nIn our fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated operating expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statements of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses.\nIn addition, we discuss below the fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 results of each of our three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—which are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280,\nSegment Reporting\n. The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each of our three businesses in the discussion below.\nConsistent with our internal management reporting processes, the below operating segment presentation is noted to include any revenues adjustments related to cloud services and license support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of these items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of our total operating segment revenues as presented in the discussion below to total revenues as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.\nIn addition, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating expenses or income, net and provision for income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items and/or it is impractical to do so. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before provision for income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.\nWe experienced COVID-19 related impacts to our business during fiscal 2021 and 2020. Certain of these historical impacts on our operating results are further discussed below. Any future impacts are currently unknown.\nSeparately, as described further below and in Notes 1 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report, we recorded a $2.3 billion non-recurring net deferred tax benefit during fiscal 2021 that related to a partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights.\nConstant Currency Presentation\nOur international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As a result, each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Annual Report using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2020, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity\n43\nreporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on May 31, 20\n2\n1\nand 20\n20\n, our financial\nstatements would reflect reported revenues of $\n1\n.\n19\nmillion in fiscal 20\n2\n1\n(using\n1\n.\n19\nas the month-end average exchange rate for the period) and $1.1\n0\nmillion in fiscal 20\n20\n(using 1.1\n0\nas the month-end average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the fiscal 20\n2\n1\nresults using the fiscal 20\n20\nexchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues during\nthe\nperiod. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency.\nTotal Revenues and Operating Expenses\nExcluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2021. The constant currency increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues during fiscal 2021 was offset by decreases in our hardware business’ revenues and services business’ revenues. The constant currency increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues and growth in our cloud license and on-premise license revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models and renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our technologies and to receive support services. The constant currency decrease in our hardware business’ revenues during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our growing cloud-based infrastructure technologies and the de-emphasis of our sales and marketing efforts for certain of our  non-strategic hardware products and related support services. The constant currency decrease in our services business’ revenues during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to a decline in our consulting revenues. All three of our businesses’ revenues were adversely impacted during fiscal 2021 and 2020 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and some of these effects may continue into fiscal 2022. While we expect these effects to be temporary, the impacts of COVID-19 for future periods are unknown. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 54%, 39% and 7%, respectively, to the growth in our total revenues during fiscal 2021.\n44\nExcluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower sales and marketing expenses, lower hardware expenses and\nlower services expenses, all of which were primarily attributable to lower headcount and a reduction in certain variable expenditures as further described below. In addition, we also incurred lower amortization of intangible assets during fiscal 2021. These constant currency expense decreases were partially offset by certain constant currency expense increases during fiscal 2021, primarily: higher cloud services and license support expenses, which increased primarily due to higher infrastructure investments that were made to support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues; higher research and development and general and administrative expenses, each of which increased primarily due to higher employee related expenses; higher acquisition related and other expenses, which increased primarily due to certain right-of-use assets and other assets that were abandoned in connection with plans to improve our cost structure and operations; and higher restructuring expenses, which increased due to actions taken during fiscal 2021 pursuant to the Fiscal 2019 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2019 Restructuring Plan). During fiscal 2021 an\nd\n2020, we curtailed a number of variable expenditures across all of our lines of businesses and functions including employee travel expenses and marketing expenses, among others, primarily in response to COVID-19. We expect certain of these expenses may normalize in future periods provided global economic and health conditions improve.\nIn constant currency, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal 2021 due to higher total revenues and lower total operating expenses. In fiscal 2022, we expect to accelerate our investments primarily in our cloud and license business. We expect fiscal 2022 total expenses growth to exceed total revenues growth and, as a result, our fiscal 2022 total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues to be modestly lower relative to fiscal 2021.\nSupplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges\nTo supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future.\nOur operating results reported pursuant to GAAP included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions and certain other expense and income items that affected our GAAP net income:\n45\nCloud and License Business\nOur cloud and license business engages in the sale and marketing of our applications and infrastructure technologies that are delivered through various deployment models and include: Oracle license support offerings; Oracle cloud services offerings; and Oracle cloud license and on-premise license offerings. License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchased by our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. Our cloud services deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage and support. Revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized over the contractual term, which is generally one to three years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. We continue\n46\nto place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market certain of our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs\n.\nExcluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total revenues increased in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 due to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues and cloud license and on-premise license revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models and renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our technologies and to receive support for which we delivered such cloud and support services during fiscal 2021. The growth in our cloud and license business’ revenues were adversely impacted during fiscal 2021 and 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impacts of COVID-19 for future periods are unknown. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 57%, 38% and 5%, respectively, of the constant currency revenue growth for this business in fiscal 2021.\nIn constant currency, our total cloud and license business’ expenses decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to lower sales and marketing expenses, which decreased primarily due to lower employee related expenses and our curtailment of variable expenditures, including lower employee travel expenses and lower\n47\nmarketing expenses, primarily in response to COVID-19. These constant currency expense decreases were partially offset by higher cloud services and license support expenses during fiscal 2021, which were primarily attributable to higher technology infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues. Our cloud services and license support expenses have grown in recent periods and, in fiscal 2022, we expect this growth to accelerate as we increase our existing data center capacity and establish data centers in new geographic locations in order to meet current and expected customer demand.\nExcluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to the fiscal 2021 increases in total revenues and the decreases in total expenses for this business.\nHardware Business\nOur hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware offerings. The hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and that are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings.\nOur constant currency hardware revenues declined in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 primarily due to our continued emphasis on the marketing and sale of our growing cloud-based infrastructure technologies and the de-\n48\nemphasis of our sales and marketing efforts for certain of our\nnon-strategic\nhardware products and related support services, the net impact of which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of hardware support contracts sold in recent periods. Our hardware business’ revenues were also adversely impacted during\nfiscal 2021 and 2020\nby the unfavorable economic effects caused by COVID-19. Geographically, we experienced constant currency revenue declines in all regions during fiscal 2021, other than Asia\nPacific\n.\nExcluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware expenses decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower hardware product expenses, lower hardware support costs and lower sales and marketing costs, all of which aligned to lower hardware revenues.\nIn constant currency, our hardware business’ total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower total expenses for this business.\nServices Business\nWe offer services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel related expenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses.\nExcluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues decreased in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a decline in our consulting revenues. Our services business revenues were also adversely impacted during fiscal 2021 and 2020 by the impacts of COVID-19, including the impacts of consulting project delays due to customer resource constraints and in-person meeting restrictions imposed by certain jurisdictions. In addition, we incurred lower billable travel expenses and lower billable sub-contractor expenses for which we would have been reimbursed by our customers, which reduced the amount of revenues and expenses we reported for our services business during fiscal 2021 and 2020. Geographically, we experienced constant currency revenue declines in all regions during fiscal 2021.\nIn constant currency, total services expenses decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower employee related costs caused by lower headcount in addition to lower travel and sub-contractor expenses as described above\n.\nIn constant currency, total margin and total margin as a percentage of total services revenues increased during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 due to lower total expenses for this business.\n49\nResearch and Development Expenses\n:\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. We intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because, in our judgment, they are essential to maintaining our competitive position.\nOn a constant currency basis, total research and development expenses increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher fiscal 2021 employee related expenses including higher salary expenses due to increased headcount, higher variable compensation expenses and higher stock-based compensation expenses. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by lower travel expenses during fiscal 2021 primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n:\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel related expenditures for IT, finance, legal and human resources support functions.\nExcluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, total general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to certain higher employee related expenses including higher variable compensation expenses and higher stock-based compensation expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower salary expenses due to lower headcount, and by lower travel expenses and certain other variable expense curtailments that we implemented during fiscal 2021 primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19. In addition, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2021 were unfavorably affected in comparison to the prior year due to a $29 million litigation related benefit that reduced our expenses during fiscal 2020.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\n:\nSubstantially all of our intangible assets were acquired through our business combinations. We amortize our intangible assets over, and monitor the appropriateness of, the estimated useful lives of these assets. We also periodically review these intangible assets for potential impairment based upon relevant facts and circumstances. Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report has additional information regarding our intangible assets and related amortization.\n50\nAmortization of intangible assets\ndecreased in fiscal 2021 due to a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized, partially offset by a smaller amount of additional amortization from intangible assets that we acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions.\nAcquisition Related and Other Expenses\n:\nAcquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments, including adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net.\nOn a constant currency basis, acquisition related and other expenses increased during fiscal 2021 due to higher other expenses, net which primarily related to certain facilities-related right-of-use assets and certain other assets that were abandoned in connection with plans to improve our cost structure and operations during fiscal 2021.\nRestructuring Expenses\n:\nRestructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies and/or other strategic initiatives. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. For additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nRestructuring expenses in fiscal 2021 and 2020 primarily related to our 2019 Restructuring Plan, which is substantially complete. Our management approved, committed to and initiated the 2019 Restructuring Plan in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. We may incur additional restructuring expenses in future periods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs associated with existing restructuring plans\n.\nThe majority of the initiatives undertaken by our 2019 Restructuring Plan were effected to implement our continued emphasis in developing, marketing and selling our cloud-based offerings. These initiatives impacted certain of our sales and marketing and research and development operations. Certain of the cost savings realized pursuant to our 2019 Restructuring Plan initiatives were offset by investments in resources and geographies that better address the development, marketing, sale and delivery of our cloud\n‑\nbased offerings including investments in our second\n‑\ngeneration cloud infrastructure.\nInterest Expense\n:\n51\nInterest expense increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 substantially due to higher average borrowings resulting from our issuance of $15.0 billion of senior notes in March 2021 and $20.0 billion of senior notes in March 2020.\nNon-Operating Income, net\n:\nNon-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange losses, the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Corporation Japan) and net other income and expenses, including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments, net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio related to our deferred compensation plan, net unrealized gains and losses related to equity securities and non-service net periodic pension income and losses.\nOur non-operating income, net increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher other income, net that primarily resulted from a $299 million unrealized investment gain for certain non-marketable securities due to an observable price change and a $193 million unrealized investment gain associated with certain marketable equity securities that we held for certain employee benefit plans and classified as trading, and for which an equal and offsetting amount was recorded to our operating expenses during the same period. These increases in non-operating income, net were partially offset by lower interest income that we recognized in fiscal 2021, which was caused by lower average interest rates that were applicable to our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances\n.\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\n:\nOur effective income tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion regarding the differences between the effective income tax rates as presented for the periods below and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rates that were in effect during these periods. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-based compensation realized by employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others.\n52\nWe recognized a benefit from income taxes in fiscal 2021 in comparison to income tax expense in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the favorable impact of a $2.3 billion net tax benefit arising from an increase in a net deferred tax asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights in fiscal 2021 and, to a lesser extent, a net change in unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements with tax authorities and an increase in excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an unfavorable jurisdictional mix of earnings and higher pre-tax income in fiscal 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking capital\n:\nThe decrease in working capital as of May 31, 2021 in comparison to May 31, 2020 was primarily due to cash used for repurchases of our common stock, the reclassification of $8.3 billion of long-term senior notes as current liabilities, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures during fiscal 2021. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by our issuance of $15.0 billion of long-term senior notes in March 2021 (refer to Recent Financing Activities below for additional information), the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal 2021 and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable.\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n:\nCash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier-1 commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of corporate debt securities and certain other securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2021 in comparison to May 31, 2020 was primarily due to cash inflows generated by our issuance of $15.0 billion of long-term senior notes in March 2021, cash inflows generated by our operations and cash inflows from stock option exercises during fiscal 2021. These cash inflows during fiscal 2021 were partially offset by certain cash outflows, primarily $20.9 billion for settled repurchases of our common stock, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders, the repayment of $2.6 billion related to our borrowings, and cash used for capital expenditures.\nThe amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual Report). As the U.S. Dollar generally weakened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2021, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries increased on a net basis as of May 31, 2021 relative to what we would have reported using constant currency rates from the May 31, 2020 balance sheet date.\nCash flows from operating activities\n:\nOur largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their license support agreements. Payments from customers for these license support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the\n53\nsales of new licenses, cloud services, hardware offerings and other services. Our primary uses of cash from\noperating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities\n.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher net income, higher cash collections from customers, a portion of which were previously delayed due to the global economic effects that resulted from COVID-19, and certain other cash favorable working capital changes, in each case in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020.\nCash flows from investing activities\n:\nThe changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable securities, and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth.\nNet cash used for investing activities was $13.1 billion during fiscal 2021 in comparison to net cash provided by investing activities of $9.8 billion during fiscal 2020. Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2021 primarily resulted from an increase in cash used for the purchases of marketable securities and other investments and an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in cash proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and other investments, in each case during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020.\nIn fiscal 2022, we expect our capital expenditures could nearly double relative to fiscal 2021, primarily to increase data center capacities and geographic locations to meet current and expected customer demand for our cloud services.\nCash flows from financing activities\n:\nThe changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs.\nNet cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2021 increased compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and higher stock repurchases, partially offset by lower debt repayments and higher cash proceeds from stock option exercises, in each case during fiscal 2021 in comparison to fiscal 2020.\nFree cash flow\n:\nTo supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows:\nLong-Term Customer Financing\n:\nWe offer certain of our customers the option to acquire licenses, cloud services, hardware and other services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We financed $941 million in fiscal 2021 and $1.0 billion in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019 of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues.\n54\nRecent Financing Activities\n:\nCash Dividends\n:\nIn fiscal 2021, we declared and paid cash dividends of $1.04 per share that totaled $3.1 billion. In June 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 29, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 15, 2021. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.\nSenior Notes\n:\nIn March 2021, we issued $15.0 billion of senior notes comprised of the following:\nWe issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repayment of indebtedness and future acquisitions. Additionally, in fiscal 2021, we repaid $1.0 billion and €1.25 billion of senior notes pursuant to their terms. Additional details regarding our senior notes are included in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\n:\nOur Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On March 10, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $20.0 billion. As of May 31, 2021, approximately $15.6 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 329.2 million shares for $21.0 billion, 361.0 million shares for $19.2 billion, and 733.8 million shares for $36.0 billion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.\nContractual Obligations\n:\nOur largest contractual obligations as of May 31, 2021 consisted of:\nIn addition, as of May 31, 2021, we had $8.5 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, the nature of which is uncertain with respect to settlement or release with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2022. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings, which are inherently uncertain with respect to outcomes, estimates and assumptions that we make as of each reporting period, are inherently unpredictable, and many aspects are out of our control. Notes 7, 11, 14 and 17 of\n55\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report include additional information regarding our contractual obligations and contingencies\n.\nWe believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.\nRestricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock Options\nOur stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders.\nWe recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2018 has been a weighted-average annualized rate of 1.0% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of restricted stock-based awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest and stock options are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2021, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, all have exercise prices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of May 31, 2021, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stock-based awards and unexercised stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested, was 7.7%.\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees; all stock-based award grants to senior officers; and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62,500 or greater. Each member of a separate executive officer committee, referred to as the Plan Committee, was allocated a fiscal 2021 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity within his or her organization, subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee.\n56\nRestricted stock-based award and stock option activity from June 1, 201\n8\nthrough May 31, 20\n2\n1\nis summarized as follows (shares in millions):\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if any, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report."

    "text": "Interest Rate Risk\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $46.6 billion and $43.1 billion as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our bank deposits are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment-grade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet investment-grade ratings criteria, which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May 31, 2021, substantially all of our marketable securities were high quality, fixed-rate debt securities and had maturity dates within one year (a description of the types of marketable securities held as of May 31, 2021 and 2020 is included in Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” above). The market values of our fixed-rate marketable securities investments are adversely impacted as interest rates increase. Due in part to these factors, we may realize losses if we sell securities prior to their scheduled maturities that declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify substantially all of our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale and record changes in their fair values to AOCL on our consolidated balance sheets, no gains or losses are recognized in our earnings due to market changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to their scheduled maturities or the declines in fair values are due to expected credit loss. We generally do not use our marketable debt securities investments for trading purposes.\nBorrowings and Related Fair Value Hedges\nOur total borrowings were $84.2 billion as of May 31, 2021, consisting of $84.1 billion of fixed-rate borrowings and $113 million of other borrowings, compared to $71.6 billion as of May 31, 2020, consisting of $71.5 billion of fixed-rate borrowings and $113 million of other borrowings. With the exception of those senior notes for which we have\n57\ncorresponding fair value hedges that are recorded at their fair values as of each reporting period and discussed further below, we record all of our fixed-rate borrowings at amortized cost and therefore, any changes in interest rates do not impact the values that we report for these senior notes or our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of May 31, 2021, we held certain interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest rate obligations associated with certain of our senior notes to variable interest rate obligations based on LIBOR that we have designated as fair value hedges, among certain other effects. Consequently, these swap agreements are recorded at their fair values at each reporting period and incur gains and losses due to changes in market interest rates but are substantially offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related senior notes for which the swap agreements pertained. By entering into these swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. Changes in interest rates affected the interest expense that we recognized in our consolidated statements of operations and the values that we report for these instruments as of each reporting date. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related swap agreements are included in Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We do not use these swap arrangements for trading purposes.\nCurrency Risk\nForeign Currency Translation Risk\nAs described under “Constant Currency Presentation” above, our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant portion of our consolidated revenues and expenses that we report in U.S. Dollars. As a result, our consolidated revenues and expenses are affected and will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major foreign currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets, liabilities, earnings and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars for, and as of the end of, each reporting period. In particular, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar generally will reduce the reported amount of our foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, total revenues and total expense that we translate into U.S. Dollars and report in our consolidated financial statements for, and as of the end of, each reporting period.\nForeign Currency Transaction Risk\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies. Our principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese Yen, Saudi Arabian Riyal, Indian Rupee and British Pound. Our foreign currency exposures primarily arise from various intercompany transactions. We have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks that arise from the aforementioned transactions. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts for major currencies in which we have an exposure so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts which mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration and we do not use them for trading purposes.\nWe realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts, and we also incur costs to enter into these foreign currency forward contracts, substantially all of which are included in non-operating income, net in our consolidated financial statements. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. Furthermore, as a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience additional foreign currency volatility in the future, in which the amounts and timing are unknown. Refer to Notes 1 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional details about our foreign currency forward contracts.\n58\nSensitivity Analysis\nThe following table sets forth the hypothetical potential losses that we consider to be the most material to the fair values of our interest rate and currency influenced holdings, including associated derivatives, or future earnings resulting from hypothetical changes in relevant market rates as of or for the reporting periods below:"

    "text": "Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Disclosure Committee and our management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e).\nBased on our management’s evaluation (with the participation of our Principal Executive and Financial Officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our Principal Executive and Financial Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 31, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2021 based on the guidelines established in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s 2013 framework. Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nBased on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2021. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee.\n59\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 20\n2\n1\nhas been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected."

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at May 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated June 21, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n63\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\nSan Jose, California\nJune 21, 2021\n64\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Oracle Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Oracle Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control— Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Oracle Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Oracle Corporation as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2021, the related notes, and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) 2 and our report dated June 21, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nJune 21, 2021\n65\nORACLE CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAs of May 31, 2021 and 2020\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n66\nORACLE CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor the Years Ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n67\nORACLE CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFor the Years Ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n68\nORACLE CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EQUITY\nFor the Years Ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n69\nORACLE CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nFor the Years Ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n70\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nMay 31,\n2021\nOracle Corporation provides products and services that substantially address all aspects of enterprise information technology (IT) environments, including applications and infrastructure technologies. We deliver our products and services to customers worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models, including cloud-based, Cloud@Customer (an instance of Oracle Cloud in the customer’s own data center), on premise and hybrid models. Oracle Cloud Software-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (SaaS and IaaS, respectively, and collectively, Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide a comprehensive and integrated stack of applications and infrastructure services delivered via cloud-based deployment models that Oracle develops, deploys, hosts, upgrades, supports and manages for the customer. Customers may also elect to purchase Oracle software licenses and hardware products and related services to manage their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Customers that purchase our software licenses may elect to purchase license support contracts, which provide our customers with rights to unspecified license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period as well as technical support assistance. Customers that purchase our hardware products may elect to purchase hardware support contracts, which provide customers with software updates and can include product repairs, maintenance services, and technical support services. We also offer customers a broad set of services offerings that are designed to improve customer utilization of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.\nOracle Corporation conducts business globally and was incorporated in 2005 as a Delaware corporation and is the successor to operations originally begun in June 1977.\nBasis of Financial Statements\nThe consolidated financial statements included our accounts and the accounts of our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest positions of certain of our consolidated entities are reported as a separate component of consolidated equity from the equity attributable to Oracle’s stockholders for all periods presented. The noncontrolling interests in our net income were not significant to our consolidated results for the periods presented and therefore have not been presented separately and instead are included as a component of non-operating income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such reclassifications did not affect total revenues, operating income or net income.\nThe comparability of our operating results during fiscal 2021 compared to the corresponding prior year periods, and of our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, was impacted by the income tax related effects of a partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights. During fiscal 2021, we recognized a benefit from income taxes primarily due to the result of a total net tax benefit of $\n2.3\nbillion that was recorded as a deferred tax asset of $\n11.3\nbillion and a non-current deferred tax liability of $\n9.1\nbillion. The deferred tax asset was recognized as a result of the book and tax basis difference on the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property and the realignment of certain legal entities, partially offset by a Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) non-current deferred tax liability. The tax amortization related to the intellectual property deferred tax asset will be recognized in future periods and any unused amortization in a particular year will carry forward indefinitely. The $\n11.3\nbillion deferred tax asset was measured based on the tax rate at which it is expected to reverse in the future. We expect to realize the net deferred tax asset recorded as a result of the intangible property transfer and will periodically assess the realizability of the net deferred tax asset. Refer to Note 14 below for additional information regarding our income taxes.\nIn\nfiscal 2021, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\nand subsequent amendments to the initial guidance\n; and\nASU 2020-01,\nInvestments—Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments—Equity Method and Joint\n71\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nVentures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)\n;\nneither of which had a material impact to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2021.\nUse of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur sources of revenues include:\nLicense support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud license and on-premise licenses purchased by our customers at their option. License support contracts provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period and include internet access to technical content, as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net cloud license and on-premise license fees. Substantially all of our customers elect to purchase and renew their license support contracts annually.\nCloud services revenues include revenues from Oracle Cloud Services offerings, which deliver applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that we develop functionality for, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage, upgrade and support and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period.\nCloud license and on-premise license revenues primarily represent amounts earned from granting customers perpetual licenses to use our database, middleware, application and industry-specific software products, which our customers use for cloud-based, on-premise and other IT environments. The vast majority of our cloud license and on-premise license arrangements include license support contracts, which are entered into at the customer’s option.\nRevenues from the sale of hardware products represent amounts earned primarily from the sale of our Oracle Engineered Systems, computer servers, storage, and industry-specific hardware. Our hardware support offerings\n72\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\ngenerally provide customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of the hardware products purchased and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees.\nOur services are offered to customers as standalone arrangements or as a part of arrangements to customers buying other products and services. Our consulting services are designed to help our customers to, among others, deploy, architect, integrate, upgrade and secure their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. Our advanced customer services are designed to provide supplemental support services, performance and higher availability for Oracle products and services.\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 606,\nRevenue From Contracts with Customers\n(ASC 606) as a single standard for revenue recognition that applies to all of our cloud, license, hardware and services arrangements and generally require revenues to be recognized upon the transfer of control of promised goods or services provided to our customers, reflecting the amount of consideration we expect to receive for those goods or services. Pursuant to ASC 606, revenues are recognized upon the application of the following steps\n:\nOur customers that contract with us for the provision of cloud services, software, hardware or other services include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and our channel partners, which include resellers and system integrators.\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customers. We record an unbilled receivable, which is included within accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets, when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing. We record deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheets when revenues are to be recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice. Our standard payment terms are generally net 30 days but may vary. Invoices for cloud license and on-premise licenses and hardware products are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery to the customer of the hardware product. Invoices for license support and hardware support contracts are generally invoiced annually in advance. Cloud SaaS and IaaS contracts are generally invoiced annually, quarterly or monthly in advance. Services are generally invoiced in advance or as the services are performed. Most contracts that contain a financing component are contracts financed through our Oracle financing division. The transaction price for a contract that is financed through our Oracle financing division is adjusted to reflect the time value of money and interest revenue is recorded as a component of non-operating income, net within our consolidated statements of operations based on market rates in the country in which the transaction is being financed.\nOur revenue arrangements generally include standard warranty or service level provisions that our arrangements will perform and operate in all material respects as defined in the respective agreements, the financial impacts of which have historically been and are expected to continue to be insignificant. Our arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services. We recognize revenues net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n73\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nRevenue Recognition for Cloud Services\nRevenues from cloud services provided on a subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period that the cloud services are delivered, beginning on the date our service is made available to a customer. We recognize revenue ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services throughout the contract period. Revenues from cloud services that are provided on a consumption basis, such as metered services, are generally recognized based on the utilization of the services by the customer.\nRevenue Recognition for License Support and Hardware Support\nOracle’s primary performance obligations with respect to license support contracts and hardware support contracts are to provide customers with technical support as needed and unspecified software product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches during the term of the support period, if and when they are available, and hardware product repairs, as applicable. Oracle is obligated to make the license and hardware support services available continuously throughout the contract period. Therefore, revenues for license support contracts and hardware support contracts are generally recognized ratably over the contractual periods that the support services are provided\n.\nRevenue Recognition for Cloud Licenses and On-Premise Licenses\nRevenues from distinct cloud license and on-premise license performance obligations are generally recognized upfront at the point in time\nwhen the software is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. For usage-based royalty arrangements with a fixed minimum guarantee amount, the minimum amount is generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the royalty customer.\nRevenue Recognition for Hardware Products\nThe hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered and ownership is transferred to the customer.\nRevenue Recognition for Services\nServices revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. Revenues for fixed price services are generally recognized over time applying input methods to estimate progress to completion. Revenues for consumption-based services are generally recognized as the services are performed.\nAllocation of the Transaction Price for Contracts that have Multiple Performance Obligations\nMany of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. Judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation is distinct. Oracle products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency; therefore, our products and services are generally not combined. We allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation within each contract.\nWe use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as the\n74\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nvast majority of all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a cloud license and on-premise license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is generally determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on-premise license revenues\n.\nRemaining Performance Obligations from Customer Contracts\nTrade receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, and deferred revenues are reported net of related uncollected deferred revenues in our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2021 and 2020. The amount of revenues recognized during the year ended May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, that were included in the opening deferred revenues balance as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was approximately $\n8.0\nbillion and $\n8.4\nbillion, respectively. Revenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods and impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial during each year ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nRemaining performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized, and include deferred revenues; invoices that have been issued to customers but were uncollected and have not been recognized as revenues; and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods. The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues that we recognize are impacted by a variety of seasonal factors. In each fiscal year, the amounts and volumes of contracting activity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter. These seasonal impacts influence how our remaining performance obligations change over time and, combined with foreign exchange rate fluctuations and other factors, influence the amount of remaining performance obligations that we report at a point in time. As of May 31, 2021, our remaining performance obligations were $\n41.3\nbillion, approximately\n60\n% of which we expect to recognize as revenues over the next twelve months,\n29\n% over the subsequent month 13 to month 36 and the remainder thereafter.\nSales of Financing Receivables\nWe offer certain of our customers the option to acquire certain of our cloud and license, hardware and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, $\n1.7\nbillion, $\n1.5\nbillion and $\n1.8\nbillion, respectively, of our financing receivables were sold to financial institutions.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 805,\nBusiness Combinations\n(ASC 805), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities\n75\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nassumed at the acquisition date\nfair values. G\noodwill as of the business acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of a business acquisition’s measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.\nCosts to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420,\nExit or Disposal Cost Obligations\n(\nASC\n420), and are accounted for separately from the business combination. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. Prior to June 1, 2019, we accounted for operating lease abandonment pursuant to the provisions of ASC 420. Effective June 1, 2019, abandoned operating leases related to an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for\nas\nRight-of-Use (\nROU\n)\nasset impairment charges pursuant to\nASC 842,\nLeases\n(ASC 842)\nand are accounted for separately from the business combination. In all periods presented, when estimating the asset impairment charges, assumptions were applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ from actual results. This may require us to revise our initial estimates which may affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made\n.\nFor a given business acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and, if so, to determine their estimated amounts. If we cannot reasonably determine the fair value of a non-income tax related pre-acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period, which is generally the case given the nature of such matters, we will recognize an asset or a liability for such pre-acquisition contingency if: (1) it is probable that an asset existed or a liability had been incurred at the business acquisition date and (2) the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the measurement period or final determination of the net asset values for the business combination, whichever comes first, changes in our estimates of such contingencies will affect earnings and could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nIn addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We reevaluate these items quarterly based upon facts and circumstances that existed as of the business acquisition date with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance’s or contingency’s estimated value, whichever comes first, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nMarketable and Non-Marketable Securities\nIn accordance with ASC 320,\nInvestments—Debt Securities\n, and based on our intentions regarding these instruments, we classify substantially all of our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders’ equity, except for any unrealized losses determined to be related to credit losses, which we record within non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We periodically evaluate our investments to determine if impairment charges are required. Substantially all of our marketable debt securities\n76\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\ninvestments are classified as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations\n.\nInvestments in equity securities, other than any equity method investments, are generally recorded at their fair values, if the fair values are readily determinable. Non-marketable equity securities where we do not have control of, nor significant influence in, the investee are recorded at cost, less any impairment, adjusted for observable price changes from orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer with any gains or losses recorded as a component of non-operating income, net as of and for each reporting period. For investments through which we have significant influence in, but not control of, the investee, we account for such investments pursuant to the equity method of accounting whereby we record our proportionate share of the investee’s earnings or losses, amortization of differences between our investment basis and the proportional book equity of the investee, and impairment, if any, as a component of non-operating income, net for each reporting period. Our non-marketable equity securities and related instruments totaled $\n971\nmillion and $\n219\nmillion as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included either in other current assets or in other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are subject to periodic impairment reviews and adjustments for observable price changes from orderly transactions. Certain of the non-marketable equity securities held as of May 31, 2021 and 2020 were with a related party entity for which we follow the equity method of accounting. We are also a counterparty to certain options to acquire additional equity interests in that entity at various times through December 2023 and we could obtain control of that entity should such options be exercised.\nFair Values of Financial Instruments\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 820,\nFair Value Measurement\n(ASC 820), to our assets and liabilities that we are required to measure at fair value pursuant to other accounting standards, including our investments in marketable debt and equity securities and our derivative financial instruments.\nThe additional disclosures regarding our fair value measurements are included in Note 4.\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts\nWe record allowances for doubtful accounts based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices. For those invoices not specifically reviewed, provisions are provided at differing rates, based upon the age of the receivable, the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded in and current and expected future economic conditions. We write-off a receivable and charge it against its recorded allowance when we have exhausted our collection efforts without success\n.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivatives and trade receivables. Our cash and cash equivalents are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide to reduce the amount of exposure to any single financial institution. Investment policies have been implemented that limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities. Our derivative contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standings and any exposure to counterparty credit-related losses in these contracts is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of these contracts fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. We generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable. The risk with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by credit evaluations we perform on our customers, the short duration of our payment terms for the significant majority of our customer contracts and by the diversification of our customer base. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues in fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019.\n77\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nWe outsource the manufacturing, assembly and delivery of the substantial majority of our hardware products to a variety of companies, many of which are located outside the U.S. Further, we have simplified our supply chain processes by reducing the number of third-party manufacturing partners and the number of locations where these third-party manufacturers build our hardware products. Any inability of these third-party manufacturing partners to deliver the contracted services for our hardware products could adversely impact future operating results of our cloud and license and hardware businesses\n.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. We evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons (generally six to nine months). Inventories in excess of future demand are written down and charged to hardware expenses. In addition, we assess the impact of changing technology to our inventories and we write down inventories that are considered obsolete. At the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. Inventories are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $\n142\nmillion and $\n211\nmillion at May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOther Receivables\nOther receivables represent value-added tax and sales tax receivables associated with the sale of our products and services to third parties. Other receivables are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $\n798\nmillion and $\n778\nmillion at May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDeferred Sales Commissions\nWe defer sales commissions earned by our sales force that are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a cloud, license support and hardware support contract. Initial sales commissions for the majority of these aforementioned contracts are generally deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we estimate to be four years. We determine the period of benefit by taking into consideration the historical and expected durations of our customer contracts, the expected useful lives of our technologies, and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts relating to certain of our cloud-based arrangements are generally deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period, which is generally one to three years. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included as a component of sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and asset balances for deferred sales commissions are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or realizable value, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from\none\nto\n40\nyears\n. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the lease terms, as appropriate. Property, plant and equipment are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We did not recognize any significant property impairment charges in fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019.\n78\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessments\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their useful lives, which generally range from\none\nto\n10\nyears\n. Each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.\nThe carrying amounts of our goodwill and intangible assets are periodically reviewed for impairment (at least annually for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. When goodwill is assessed for impairment, we have the option to perform an assessment of qualitative factors of impairment (optional assessment) prior to necessitating a quantitative impairment test. Should the optional assessment be used for any given fiscal year, qualitative factors to consider for a reporting unit include: cost factors; financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political, business, or other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations; macroeconomic conditions; and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit. If we determine in the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed. Otherwise, no further testing is required. For those reporting units tested using a quantitative approach, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. To determine the fair value of each reporting unit we utilize estimates, judgments and assumptions including estimated future cash flows the reporting unit is expected to generate on a discounted basis; the discount rate used as a part of the discounted cash flow analysis; future economic and market conditions; and market comparables of peer companies, among others. If, as per the quantitative test, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, impairment is recognized for the difference, limited to the amount of goodwill recognized for the reporting unit. Our most recent goodwill impairment analysis was performed on March 1, 2021 and did\nno\nt result in a goodwill impairment charge. We did not recognize impairment charges in fiscal 2020 or 2019.\nRecoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. Recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019. At least annually, we assess the useful lives of our finite lived intangible assets and may adjust the period over which these assets are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a shorter amortization period is more reflective of the period in which these assets contribute to our cash flows.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nDuring fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, we used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks (see Note 10 below for additional information). We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n(ASC 815), which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of each reporting date. ASC 815 also requires that changes in our derivatives’ fair values be recognized in earnings, unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met (i.e., the instruments are accounted for as hedges).\nThe accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, loss or gain attributable to the risk being hedged is recognized in earnings in the period of change with a corresponding earnings offset recorded to the item for which the risk is being hedged.\n79\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nFor a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, each reporting period we record the change in fair value of the derivative to AOCL in our consolidated balance sheets, and the change is reclassified to earnings in the period the hedged item affects earnings.\nLeases\nOur accounting policy for leases pursuant to ASC 842, Leases, was prospectively effective for us as of June 1, 2019. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of future payments, because the implicit rate of the lease is generally not known. ROU assets related to our operating lease liabilities are measured at lease inception based on the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any prepaid lease payments and less any lease incentives. Our lease terms that are used in determining our operating lease liabilities at lease inception may include options to extend or terminate the leases when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. We amortize our ROU assets as operating lease expense generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term and classify both the lease amortization and imputed interest as operating expenses. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and in such cases, we generally account for the components as a single lease component. We do not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for any lease with an original lease term of less than one year.\nROU assets related to our operating leases are included in other non-current assets, short-term operating lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities are included in other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Cash flow movements related to our lease activities are included in prepaid expenses and other assets and accounts payable and other liabilities as presented in net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended May 31, 2021 and 2020. Note 11 below provides additional information regarding our leases.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nWe are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. Descriptions of our accounting policies associated with contingencies assumed as a part of a business combination are provided under “Business Combinations” above. For legal and other contingencies that are not a part of a business combination or related to income taxes, we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Note 17 below provides additional information regarding certain of our legal contingencies.\nForeign Currency\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies. In general, the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local country’s currency. Consequently, revenues and expenses of operations outside the U.S. are translated into U.S. Dollars using weighted-average exchange rates while assets and liabilities of operations outside the U.S. are translated into U.S. Dollars using exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are substantially included in stockholders’ equity as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and related periodic movements are summarized as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net foreign exchange transaction losses included in non-operating income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were $\n112\nmillion, $\n185\nmillion and $\n111\nmillion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n80\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for share-based payments to employees, including grants of service-based restricted stock unit awards, service-based employee stock options, performance-based stock options (PSOs), and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with ASC 718,\nCompensation\n—\nStock Compensation,\nwhich requires that share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. We account for forfeitures of stock-based awards as they occur.\nFor our service-based stock awards, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally\nfour years\n.\nFor our PSOs, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the longer of the derived, explicit or implicit service period (which is the period of time expected for the performance condition to be satisfied). During our interim and annual reporting periods, stock-based compensation expense is recorded based on expected attainment of performance targets. Changes in our estimates of the expected attainment of performance targets that result in a change in the number of shares that are expected to vest, or changes in our estimates of implicit service periods, may cause the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we record for each interim reporting period to vary. Any changes in estimates that impact our expectation of the number of shares that are expected to vest are reflected in the amount of stock-based compensation expense that we recognize for each PSO tranche on a cumulative catch up basis during each interim reporting period in which such estimates are altered. Changes in estimates of the implicit service periods are recognized prospectively.\nWe record deferred tax assets for stock-based compensation awards that result in deductions on certain of our income tax returns based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized in each reporting period and the fair values attributable to the vested portion of stock awards assumed in connection with a business combination at the statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions that we are able to recognize such tax deductions. The impacts of the actual tax deductions for stock-based awards that are realized in these jurisdictions are generally recognized in the reporting period that a restricted stock-based award vests or a stock option is exercised with any shortfall/windfall relative to the deferred tax asset established recorded as a discrete detriment/benefit to our provision for income taxes in such period. Note 13 below provides additional information regarding our stock-based compensation plans.\nAdvertising\nSubstantially all advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses, which were included within sales and marketing expenses, were $\n202\nmillion, $\n178\nmillion and $\n169\nmillion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nResearch and Development Costs and Software Development Costs\nAll research and development costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730,\nResearch and Development\n. Software development costs required to be capitalized under ASC 985-20,\nCosts of Software to be Sold, Leased or Marketed,\nand under ASC 350-40,\nInternal-Use Software,\nwere not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n81\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nAcquisition Related and Other Expenses\nAcquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments including adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net.\nNon-Operating Income, net\nNon-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange losses, the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Corporation Japan) and net other income and expenses, including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments, net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our investment portfolio related to our deferred compensation plan, net unrealized gains and losses related to equity securities and non-service net periodic pension income and losses.\nNon-operating income, net in fiscal 2021 included\na $\n299\nmillion unrealized investment gain for certain non-marketable securities due to an observable price change and a $\n193\nmillion unrealized investment gain associated with certain marketable equity securities that we held for certain employee benefit plans and classified as trading, and for which an equal and offsetting amount was recorded to our operating expenses during the same period\n.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740,\nIncome Taxes\n(ASC 740). Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.\nA two-step approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations.\nA description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as a part of a business combination is provided under “Business Combinations” above.\n82\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFinancial Instruments\n:\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04,\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\n(ASU 2020-04) and also issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance (collectively, Topic 848). Topic 848 provides optional guidance for contract modifications and certain hedging relationships associated with the transition from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. We will adopt Topic 848 when our relevant contracts are modified upon transition to alternative reference rates. We do not expect our adoption of Topic 848 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Taxes\n:\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\n(ASU 2019-12), which is intended to simplify various areas related to the accounting for income taxes and improve consistent application of Topic 740. ASU 2019-12 is effective for us beginning in fiscal 2022, and earlier adoption is permitted. We do not expect our adoption of ASU 2019-12 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nFiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 Acquisitions\nDuring fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nwe acquired certain companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products and services offerings\n. These acquisitions were not significant\nindividually or in the aggregate to our consolidated financial statements.\nCash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, money market funds and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other securities.\nThe amortized principal amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated their fair values at May 31, 2021 and 2020.\nWe use the specific identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our marketable securities classified as available-for-sale.\nSuch realized gains and losses were insignificant for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. The following table summarizes the components of our cash equivalents and marketable securities held, substantially all of which were classified as available-for-sale:\nAs of May 31, 2021 and 2020, substantially all of our marketable securities investments mature within one year. Our investment portfolio is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. As described above, we limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities, which have high credit ratings and also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.\n83\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nRestricted cash that was included within cash and cash equivalents as presented within our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2021 and 2020 and our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was nominal\n.\nWe perform fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset’s or a liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nOur assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following (Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are defined above):\nOur marketable securities investments consist of money market funds, Tier 1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other securities. Marketable securities as presented per our consolidated balance sheets included securities with original maturities at the time of purchase greater than three months and the remainder of the securities were included in cash and cash equivalents. Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of our instruments that were classified as Level 1 in the table above were derived from quoted market prices and active markets for these instruments that exist. Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of Level 2 instruments listed in the table above were derived from the following: non-\n84\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nbinding market consensus prices that were corroborated by observable market data, quoted market prices for similar instruments, or pricing models, such as discounted cash flow techniques, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data including LIBOR-based yield curves, among others\n.\nBased on the trading prices of the $\n84.2\nbillion and $\n71.6\nbillion of senior notes and the related fair value hedges (refer to Notes 7 and 10 for additional information) that we had outstanding as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, the estimated fair values of the senior notes and the related fair value hedges using Level 2 inputs at May 31, 2021 and 2020 were $\n89.6\nbillion and $\n80.9\nbillion, respectively.\nProperty, plant and equipment, net consisted of the following:\nThe changes in intangible assets for fiscal 2021 and the net book value of intangible assets as of May 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nAs of May 31, 2021, estimated future amortization expenses related to intangible assets were as follows (in millions):\n85\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nThe changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill, net, which is generally not deductible for tax purposes, for our operating segments for fiscal 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n86\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nNotes payable and other borrowings consisted of the following:\n87\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nFuture principal payments (adjusted for the effects of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements associated with the July 2025 Notes) for all of our borrowings at May 31, 2021 were as follows (in millions):\nSenior Notes\nInterest is payable semi-annually for the senior notes listed in the above table except for the Euro Notes for which interest is payable annually. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances.\nThe senior notes rank pari passu with any other notes we may issue in the future pursuant to our commercial paper program (see additional discussion regarding our commercial paper program below) and all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation. All existing and future liabilities of the subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation are or will be effectively senior to the senior notes and any future issuances of commercial paper notes. We were in compliance with all debt-related covenants at May 31, 2021.\n88\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nCommercial Paper Program and Commercial Paper Notes\nOur existing $\n3.0\nbillion commercial paper program allows us to issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a private placement exemption from the registration requirements under federal and state securities laws pursuant to dealer agreements with various banks and an Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas. As of May 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not have any outstanding commercial paper notes.\nFiscal 2019 Oracle Restructuring Plan\nDuring fiscal 2019, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations due to our acquisitions and certain other operational activities (2019 Restructuring Plan). In fiscal 2021, our management supplemented the 2019 Restructuring Plan to reflect additional actions that we expected to take.\nRestructuring costs associated with the 2019 Restructuring Plan were recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they were incurred.\nWe recorded $\n430\nmillion and $\n261\nmillion of restructuring expenses in connection with the 2019 Restructuring Plan in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total costs recorded to date in our consolidated statements of operations in connection with the 2019 Restructuring Plan were $\n1.2\nbillion. Actions pursuant to the 2019 Restructuring Plan were substantially complete as of May 31, 2021.\nSummary of All Plans\nFiscal 2021 Activity\nFiscal 2020 Activity\n89\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nFiscal 2019 Activity\nDeferred revenues consisted of the following:\nDeferred cloud services and license support revenues and deferred hardware revenues substantially represent customer payments made in advance for cloud or support contracts that are typically billed in advance with corresponding revenues generally being recognized ratably over the contractual periods. Deferred services revenues include prepayments for our services business and revenues for these services are generally recognized as the services are performed. Deferred cloud license and on-premise license revenues typically resulted from customer payments that related to undelivered products and services or specified enhancements.\nFair Value Hedges\n—\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements and Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap Agreements\nIn May 2018, we entered into certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our July 2025 Notes by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated 2025 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to variable-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOR. In July 2014, we entered into certain interest rate\n90\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nswap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our July 2021 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively became variable based on LIBOR. The critical terms of the swap agreements match the critica\nl terms of the July 2025 Notes\nand July 2021 Notes\nthat the swap agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates\n.\nWe have designated the aforementioned swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC 815.\nThe changes in fair values of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements associated with our July 2025 Notes are recognized as interest expense and non-operating income, net in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in non-current assets or non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe changes in fair values of our interest rate swap agreements associated with our July 2021 Notes are recognized as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense and amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the foreign exchange risk being hedged, as applicable, is recognized as non-operating income, net in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amount included in notes payable, current or notes payable, non-current. We exclude the portion of the change in fair value of cross-currency interest rate swap agreements attributable to the related cross-currency basis spread in our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The change in fair value of these cross-currency interest rate swap agreements attributable to the cross-currency basis spread is included in AOCL. The periodic interest settlements for the swap agreements for the July 2025 Notes and July 2021 Notes are recorded as interest expense and are included as a part of cash flows from operating activities and cash flows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financing activities.\nCash Flow Hedges\n—\nCross-Currency Swap Agreements\nIn connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency exchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro-denominated January 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate of\n3.53\n% and U.S. Dollar-denominated principal amount of $\n1.6\nbillion. We had designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and accounted for these as cash flow hedges pursuant to ASC 815. In fiscal 2021, the cross-currency swap agreements and the January 2021 Notes matured and were settled in cash. The cash flows related to the cross-currency swap agreements that pertained to the periodic interest settlements were classified as operating activities and the cash flows that pertained to the principal balance were classified as financing activities.\nForeign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.\n91\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nWe do not\ndesignate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815\n.\nAccordingly, we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of the end of each reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. The balance sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contrac\nts is non-operating income, net\nfor both realized and unrealized gains and losses.\nAs of May 31, 2021 and 2020, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $\n4.3\nbillion and $\n4.2\nbillion, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were $\n4.5\nbillion and $\n3.9\nbillion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at May 31, 2021 and 2020. The cash flows related to these foreign currency contracts are classified as operating activities.\nThe effects of derivative instruments designated as hedges on certain of our consolidated financial statements were as follows as of or for each of the respective periods presented below (amounts presented exclude any income tax effects):\nFair Values of Derivative Instruments Designated as Hedges in Consolidated Balance Sheets\nEffects of Fair Value Hedging Relationships on Hedged Items in Consolidated Balance Sheets\n92\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nEffects of Derivative Instruments Designated as Hedges on Income\nGain (Loss) on Derivative Instruments Designated as Hedges included in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) or Loss (OCL)\nLeases\nWe have operating leases that primarily relate to certain of our facilities, data centers and vehicles. As of May 31, 2021, our operating leases substantially have remaining terms of\none year\nto\neleven years\n, some of which include options to extend and/or terminate the leases.\nOperating lease expenses totaled $\n654\nmillion, net of sublease income of $\n13\nmillion in fiscal 2021 and $\n599\nmillion, net of sublease income of $\n16\nmillion in fiscal 2020. At May 31, 2021, ROU assets, current lease liabilities and non-current lease liabilities for our operating leases were $\n2.6\nbillion, $\n664\nmillion and $\n2.1\nbillion, respectively. We recorded ROU assets of $\n1.7\nbillion in exchange for operating lease obligations during the year ended May 31, 2021. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $\n696\nmillion for year ended May 31, 2021. As of May 31, 2021, the weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases was approximately\nseven years\nand the weighted average discount rate used for calculating operating lease obligations was\n2.8\n%. As of May 31, 2021, we have $\n653\nmillion of additional operating lease commitments, primarily for data centers, that commence in fiscal 2022 for terms of\none\nto\neleven\nyears\nthat were not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2021 or in the maturities table below.\n93\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities were as follows as of\nMay 31, 2021\n(in millions):\nUnconditional Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers, which are agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies, perform final assemblies and perform testing of our hardware products. We also obtain individual components for our hardware products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amounts disclosed below. Certain routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts below, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.\nAs of May 31, 2021, our unconditional purchase and certain other obligations were as follows (in millions):\nAs described in Notes 7 and 10 above, as of May 31, 2021 we have senior notes and other borrowings that mature at various future dates and derivative financial instruments outstanding that we leverage to manage certain risks and exposures.\nGuarantees\nOur cloud, license and hardware sales agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our products infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any material liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our sales agreements also include provisions indemnifying customers against liabilities in the event we breach confidentiality or service level requirements. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to our\n94\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nlimited and infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.\nOur Oracle Cloud Services agreements generally include a warranty that the cloud services will be performed in all material respects as defined in the agreement during the service period.\nOur license and hardware agreements also generally include a warranty that our products will substantially operate as described in the applicable program documentation for a period of one year after delivery. We also warrant that services we perform will be provided in a manner consistent with industry standards for a period of 90 days from performance of the services.\nWe occasionally are required, for various reasons, to enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business including, among others, guarantees related to taxes, import licenses and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nIn connection with certain litigation, we posted certain court-mandated surety bonds with a court and entered into related indemnification agreements with each of the surety bond issuing companies. Additional information is provided in Note 17 below.\nCommon Stock Repurchases\nOur Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On March 10, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $\n20.0\nbillion.\nAs of May 31, 2021,\napproximately $\n15.6\nbillion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased\n329.2\nmillion shares for $\n21.0\nbillion\n(including\n0.8\nmillion shares for $\n66\nmillion that were repurchased but not settled)\n,\n361.0\nmillion shares for $\n19.2\nbillion, and\n733.8\nmillion shares for $\n36.0\nbillion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, under the stock repurchase program.\nOur stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.\nDividends on Common Stock\nDuring fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $\n1.04\n, $\n0.96\nand $\n0.81\nper share of our outstanding common stock, respectively, which we paid during the same period.\nIn June 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\n0.32\nper share of our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on\nJuly 29, 2021\nto stockholders of record as of the close of business on\nJuly 15, 2021\n. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.\n95\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following table summarizes, as of each balance sheet date, the components of our AOCL, net of income taxes:\nStock-Based Compensation Plans\nStock Plans\nIn fiscal 2021, we adopted the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan) to replace the Amended and Restated 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan and, together with the 2020 Plan, the Plans) which provides for the issuance of long-term performance awards, including restricted stock-based awards, non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options, as well as stock purchase rights and stock appreciation rights, to our eligible employees, officers and directors who are also employees or consultants, independent consultants and advisers.\nThe total number of shares authorized under the 2020 Plan is (i)\n90\nmillion shares, plus (ii) the number of shares that remained unissued and were available for grant under the 2000 Plan as of the date of adoption of the 2020 Plan, plus (iii) the number of shares granted and outstanding as of the date of adoption of the 2020 Plan which would have been available again for issuance under the terms of the 2000 Plan had the 2020 Plan not been adopted. Under the Plans, for each share granted as a full value award in the form of a restricted stock unit (RSU) or a performance-based restricted stock award (PSU), an equivalent of\n2.5\nshares is deducted from our pool of shares available for grant.\nAs of May 31, 2021,\n107\nmillion unvested restricted stock units (RSUs),\n36\nmillion performance-based stock options (PSOs), and service-based stock options (SOs) to purchase\n69\nmillion shares of common stock, of which\n66\nmillion shares were vested, were outstanding under the Plans. Approximately\n210\nmillion shares of common stock were available for future awards under the 2020 Plan as of May 31, 2021. To date, we have not issued any stock options under the 2020 Plan or any stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under either of the Plans.\nThe vesting schedule for all awards granted under the Plans is established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. RSUs generally require service-based vesting of\n25\n% annually over\nfour years\n. SOs were previously granted under the 2000 Plan at not less than fair market value, become exercisable generally 25% annually over\nfour years\nof service, and generally expire\n10\nyears from the date of grant.\nPSOs granted under the 2000 Plan to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer in fiscal 2018 consisted of\nseven\nnumerically equivalent vesting tranches that potentially may vest.\nOne\ntranche vests solely on the attainment of a market-based metric. The remaining\nsix\ntranches require the attainment of both a performance metric and a market capitalization metric. In each case, the market-based metric, performance metrics and market capitalization metrics for the PSOs may be achieved at any time during the required performance period, assuming continued employment and service through the date the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors certifies that performance has been achieved. The PSOs have contractual lives of\neight years\nin comparison to the typical\nten year\ncontractual lives for SOs. For the six tranches of the PSOs with both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense is to be recognized starting at the time each vesting tranche becomes probable of achievement over the longer of the estimated implicit service period or derived service period. Stock-based compensation associated with a vesting tranche where vesting is no longer\n96\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\ndetermined to be probable is reversed on a cumulative basis and is no longer prospectively recognized in the period when such a determination is made\n.\nStock-based compensation for the market-based tranche was recognized using the derived service period for the market-based metric achievement, which we estimated to be approximately\nthree years\n.\nIn connection with certain of our acquisitions, we assumed certain outstanding restricted stock-based awards and stock options under each acquired company’s respective stock plans, or we substituted substantially similar awards under the Plans. These restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed or substituted generally retained all of the rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally granted. As of May 31, 2021, stock options to purchase approximately\n1\nmillion shares of common stock were outstanding under acquired company stock plans that Oracle assumed.\nIn fiscal 1993, the Board adopted the 1993 Directors’ Stock Plan (the Directors’ Plan), which provides for the issuance of RSUs and other stock-based awards, including non-qualified stock options, to non-employee directors. The Directors’ Plan has from time to time been amended and restated. Under the terms of the Directors’ Plan, 10 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance\n(including a fiscal 2013 amendment to increase the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance by\n2\nmillion shares). In prior years, we granted stock options at not less than fair market value, that vest over\nfour year\ns, and expire no more than\n10\nyears from the date of grant. Currently, we only grant RSUs that vest fully on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant. The Directors’ Plan was most recently amended on April 29, 2016 and permits the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine the amount and form of automatic grants of stock awards, if any, to each non-employee director upon first becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic grants for chairing certain Board committees, subject to certain stockholder approved limitations set forth in the Directors’ Plan. In April 2020, the Compensation Committee reduced the maximum value of the annual automatic RSU grants to each non-employee director from $\n400,000\nto $\n350,000\nand eliminated all equity grants for chairing board committees. As of May 31, 2021, approximately\n49,000\nunvested RSUs and stock options to purchase approximately\n1\nmillion shares of common stock (all of which were vested) were outstanding under the Directors’ Plan. As of May 31, 2021, approximately\n1\nmillion shares were available for future stock awards under this plan.\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock-based award activity granted pursuant to Oracle-based stock plans and stock plans assumed from our acquisitions for our last three fiscal years ended May 31, 2021:\nThe total grant date fair values of restricted stock-based awards that were vested and issued in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $\n1.6\nbillion, $\n1.5\nbillion and $\n1.3\nbillion, respectively. As of May 31, 2021, total unrecognized stock-\n97\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nbased compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock-based awards was $\n3.7\nbillion and is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of\n2.76\nyears\n.\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity, including SOs and PSOs, and includes awards granted pursuant to the Plans and stock plans assumed from our acquisitions for our last three fiscal years ended May 31, 2021:\nStock options outstanding that have vested and that are expected to vest as of May 31, 2021 were as follows:\nStock-Based Compensation Expense and Valuations of Stock Awards\nWe estimated the fair values of our restricted stock-based awards that are solely subject to service-based vesting requirements based upon their market values as of the grant dates, discounted for the present values of expected dividends.\nStock-based compensation expense was included in the following operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of operations:\n98\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nTax Benefits from Exercises of Stock Options and Vesting of Restricted Stock-Based Awards\nTotal cash received as a result of stock option exercises was approximately $\n1.7\nbillion, $\n1.5\nbillion and $\n2.0\nbillion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The total aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock-based awards that vested and were issued and stock options that were exercised was $\n3.7\nbillion, $\n2.9\nbillion and $\n3.1\nbillion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In connection with the vesting and issuance of restricted stock-based awards and stock options that were exercised, the tax benefits realized by us were $\n842\nmillion, $\n638\nmillion and $\n692\nmillion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nWe have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is\n95\n% of the fair market value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May 31, 2021,\n42\nmillion shares were reserved for future issuances under the Purchase Plan. We issued\n2\nmillion shares in each of fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, under the Purchase Plan.\nDefined Contribution and Other Postretirement Plans\nWe offer various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution plan expense was $\n380\nmillion, $\n376\nmillion and $\n380\nmillion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn the U.S., regular employees can participate in the Oracle Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (Oracle 401(k) Plan). Participants can generally contribute up to\n40\n% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g) limit as defined by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We match a portion of employee contributions, currently\n50\n% up to\n6\n% of compensation each pay period, subject to maximum aggregate matching amounts. Our contributions to the Oracle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $\n150\nmillion, $\n152\nmillion and $\n154\nmillion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe also offer non-qualified deferred compensation plans to certain employees whereby they may defer a portion of their annual base and/or variable compensation until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were each approximately $\n813\nmillion and approximately $\n636\nmillion as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were presented in other non-current assets and other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n99\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nWe sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed through our acquisitions or are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Our total defined benefit plan pension expenses were $\n105\nmillion, $\n97\nmillion and $\n90\nmillion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status) of our defined benefit plans as of May 31, 2021 were $\n1.4\nbillion and $\n889\nmillion, respectively, and as of May 31, 2020 were $\n1.3\nbillion and $\n884\nmillion, respectively.\nOur effective tax rates for each of the periods presented are the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2021 varied from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to a net deferred tax benefit that totaled $\n2.3\nbillion that we recognized as a result of a partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property (IP) rights, earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction and the tax effect of GILTI. Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2020 varied from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction and the tax effect of GILTI. Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2019 varied from the\n21\n% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) primarily due to earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction, GILTI, and a $\n389\nmillion net reduction to our transition tax recorded in connection with the Tax Act pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.\nThe following is a geographical breakdown of income before benefit from (provision for) income taxes:\n100\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nThe benefit from (provision for) income taxes consisted of the following:\nThe benefit from (provision for) income taxes differed from the amount computed by applying the federal statutory rate to our income before benefit from (provision for) income taxes as follows (certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation):\n101\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nThe components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nWe provide for United States income taxes on the undistributed earnings and the other outside basis temporary differences of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. At May 31, 2021, the amount of temporary differences related to undistributed earnings and other outside basis temporary differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided was approximately $\n7.9\nbillion. If the undistributed earnings and other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. At May 31, 2021, assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately $\n1.4\nbillion.\nOur net deferred tax assets were $\n5.8\nbillion and $\n3.2\nbillion as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We believe that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income change.\nThe valuation allowance was $\n1.5\nbillion and $\n1.4\nbillion as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. A majority of the valuation allowances as of May 31, 2021 and 2020 related to tax assets established in purchase accounting and other tax credits. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance and the recognition of the associated tax benefits associated with our acquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes\n102\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nsubsequent to our final determination of the valuation allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period (as defined above), whichever comes first\n.\nAt May 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $\n502\nmillion, which are subject to limitation on their utilization.\nApproximately $\n447\nmillion of these federal net operating losses expire in various years between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2038. Approximately $\n55\nmillion of these federal net operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $\n2.0\nbillion at May 31, 2021, which expire between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2040 and are subject to limitations on their utilization. We had total foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $\n1.8\nbillion at May 31, 2021, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $\n1.7\nbillion of these foreign net operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the foreign net operating losses, approximately $\n86\nmillion, expire between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2041. At May 31, 2021, we had federal capital loss carryforwards of approximately $\n501\nmillion, which expire in fiscal 2026. We had state capital loss carryforwards of approximately $\n661\nmillion, which expire between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026. We had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $\n1.1\nbillion at May 31, 2021, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $\n765\nmillion of these tax credit carryforwards are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the tax credit carryforwards, approximately $\n378\nmillion, expire in various years between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2041.\nWe classify our unrecognized tax benefits as either current or non-current income taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits, including acquisitions, were as follows:\nAs of May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, $\n4.4\nbillion, $\n4.3\nbillion and $\n4.2\nbillion, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. We recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations of $\n166\nmillion, $\n202\nmillion and $\n312\nmillion during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of May 31, 2021 and 2020 were $\n1.6\nbillion and $\n1.4\nbillion, respectively.\nDomestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2019. Many issues are at an advanced stage in the examination process, the most significant of which include transfer pricing, domestic production activity, foreign tax credits, research and development credits, state economic nexus, and qualification as a state manufacturer. With all of these domestic audit issues considered in the aggregate, we believe that it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2021, the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $\n798\nmillion ($\n671\nmillion net of offsetting tax benefits). Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2010 and, with some exceptions, we are no longer subject to audit for those periods. Our U.S. state income tax returns, with some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007, and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods.\n103\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nInternationally, tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits. We believe that it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2021, the gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) by as much as $\n197\nmillion ($\n89\nmillion net of offsetting tax benefits) in the next 12 months related primarily to transfer pricing. With some exceptions, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 2001.\nWe are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Spain, where the amounts under controversy are significant. In some, although not all, cases, we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it could result in a further charge to expense.\nWe believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits. However, there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof.\nASC 280,\nSegment Reporting\n, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\nOur chief operating decision makers (CODMs) are our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer. We are organized by line of business and geographically. While our CODMs evaluate results in a number of different ways, the line of business management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed. The tabular information below presents the financial information provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the company’s performance and allocating company resources.\nWe have\nthree\nbusinesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—each of which is comprised of a\nsingle\noperating segment. All\nthree\nof our businesses market and sell our offerings globally to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers with a worldwide sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs.\nOur cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through cloud and on-premise deployment models including our cloud services and license support offerings; and our cloud license and on-premise license offerings. Cloud services and license support revenues are generated from offerings that are typically contracted with customers directly, billed to customers in advance, delivered to customers over time with our revenue recognition occurring over the contractual terms, and renewed by customers upon completion of the contractual terms. Cloud services and license support contracts provide customers with access to the latest updates to the applications and infrastructure technologies as they become available and for which the customer contracted and also include related technical support services over the contractual term. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments. We generally recognize revenues at the point in time the software is made available to the customer to download and use, which typically is immediate upon signature of the license contract. In each fiscal year, our cloud and license\n104\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nbusiness’ contractual activities are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and the related cash flows are typically highest in the following quarter (i.e., in the first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year) as we receive payments from these contracts\n.\nOur hardware business provides Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software to support diverse IT environments. Our hardware business also offers hardware support, which provides customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of their hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other software, and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services.\nOur services business provides services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.\nWe do not track our assets for each business. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by operating segment.\nThe following table presents summary results for each of our three businesses for each of fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n105\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nThe following table reconciles total operating segment revenues to total revenues as well as total operating segment margin to income before benefit from (provision for) income taxes:\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nWe have considered information that is regularly reviewed by our CODMs in evaluating financial performance, and disclosures presented outside of our financial statements in our earnings releases and used in investor presentations to disaggregate revenues to depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The principal category we use to disaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and services as presented in our consolidated statements of operations, the total of which is reconciled to revenues from our reportable segments as per the preceding tables of this footnote.\nThe following table is a summary of our total revenues by geographic region. The relative proportion of our total revenues between each geographic region as presented in the table below was materially consistent across each of our operating segments’ revenues for each of fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n106\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nThe following table presents our cloud services and license support revenues by applications and infrastructure ecosystems.\nGeographic Information\nDisclosed in the table below is geographic information for each country that comprised greater than three percent of our total revenues for any of fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted‑average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock-based awards, stock options, and shares issuable under the employee stock purchase plan as applicable pursuant to the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share\n:\n107\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nHewlett-Packard Company Litigation\nOn June 15, 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company, now Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HP), filed a complaint in the California Superior Court, County of Santa Clara against Oracle Corporation alleging numerous causes of action including breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, defamation, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act. The complaint alleged that when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23, 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HP’s Itanium-based servers, it breached a settlement agreement signed on September 20, 2010 (the HP Settlement Agreement), resolving litigation between HP and one of Oracle’s former CEOs who had previously acted as HP’s chief executive officer and chairman of HP’s board of directors. HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties’ rights and obligations under the HP Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief. Oracle answered the complaint and filed cross-claims.\nAfter a bench trial on the meaning of the HP Settlement Agreement, the court found that the HP Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop certain of its software products for use on HP’s Itanium-based servers at no cost to HP. The case proceeded to a jury trial in May 2016. On June 30, 2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and against Oracle on its cross-claims. The jury awarded HP $\n3.0\nbillion in damages. Under the court’s rulings, HP is entitled to post-judgment interest, but not pre-judgment interest, on this award.\nAfter the trial court denied Oracle’s motion for a new trial, Oracle filed a notice of appeal on January 17, 2017. On February 2, 2017, HP filed a notice of appeal of the trial court’s denial of pre-judgment interest. Oral argument was held on May 27, 2021. On June 14, 2021, the Court of Appeal affirmed both the judgment against Oracle noted above, and the denial of pre-judgment interest. Oracle has posted a mandated surety bond with the trial court for the amounts owing.\nNo\namounts have been paid or recorded to our results of operations. If the Court of Appeal’s judgment is ultimately affirmed, we would be liable for the amount of the jury award that is described above plus post-judgment interest.\nWe continue to believe that we have meritorious defenses against HP’s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them including our intention to petition for review by the California Supreme Court.\nWe cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding this process and the nature of the claims. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of the process related to this action is uncertain. It is possible that the resolution of this action could have a material impact on our future cash flows and results of operations.\nDerivative Litigation Concerning Oracle’s NetSuite Acquisition\nOn May 3 and July 18, 2017, two alleged stockholders filed separate derivative lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf. Thereafter, the court consolidated the two derivative cases and designated the July 18, 2017 complaint as the operative complaint. The consolidated lawsuit was brought against all the then-current members and one former member of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiff alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) at an excessive price. The complaint sought (and the operative complaint continues to seek) declaratory relief, unspecified monetary damages (including interest), and attorneys’ fees and costs. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the court denied on March 19, 2018.\nOn May 4, 2018, our Board of Directors established a Special Litigation Committee (the SLC) to investigate the allegations in this derivative action. Three non-employee directors served on the SLC. On August 15, 2019, the SLC filed a letter with the court, stating that the SLC believed that plaintiff should be allowed to proceed with the derivative litigation on behalf of Oracle. After the SLC advised the Board that it had fulfilled its duties and\n108\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nobligations, the Board withdrew the SLC’s authority, except that the SLC maintained certain authority to respond to discovery requests in the litigation\n.\nAfter plaintiff filed the July 18, 2017 complaint, an additional plaintiff joined the case. Plaintiffs filed several amended complaints, and filed their most recent amended complaint on December 11, 2020. The operative complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty against our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Technology Officer, the estate of Mark Hurd (our former Chief Executive Officer who passed away on October 18, 2019), and two other members of our Board of Directors. Oracle is named as a nominal defendant. On December 11, 2020, the estate of Mark Hurd and the two other members of our Board of Directors moved to dismiss this complaint, and a hearing on this motion was held on February 16, 2021. The court has not yet ruled on this motion. On December 28, 2020, our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Technology Officer, and Oracle as a nominal defendant filed answers to the operative complaint.\nThe parties are conducting discovery. Trial is scheduled to commence on July 18, 2022.\nWhile Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nSecurities Class Action and Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracle’s Cloud Business\nOn August 10, 2018, a putative class action, brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us, our Chief Technology Officer, our then-two Chief Executive Officers, two other Oracle executives, and one former Oracle executive. As noted above, Mr. Hurd, one of our then-two Chief Executive Officers, passed away on October 18, 2019. On March 8, 2019, plaintiff filed an amended complaint. Plaintiff alleges that the defendants made or are responsible for false and misleading statements regarding Oracle’s cloud business. Plaintiff further alleges that the former Oracle executive engaged in insider trading. Plaintiff seeks a ruling that this case may proceed as a class action, and seeks damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, and unspecified declaratory/injunctive relief. On April 19, 2019, defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff’s amended complaint. On December 17, 2019, the court granted this motion, giving plaintiffs an opportunity to file an amended complaint, which plaintiff filed on February 17, 2020. On April 23, 2020, defendants filed a motion to dismiss, and the court held a hearing on this motion on September 24, 2020. On March 22, 2021, the court granted in part and denied in part this motion. The court dismissed the action as to one Oracle executive and the former Oracle executive. The court permitted plaintiff to proceed with only a narrow omissions theory against the remaining defendants. On April 21, 2021, defendants filed an answer to the complaint. Trial is scheduled to commence on November 6, 2023.  We believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action, and we will continue to vigorously defend it.\nOn February 12 and May 8, 2019, two stockholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The cases were consolidated, and on July 8, 2019, a single plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint. The consolidated complaint brought various claims relating to the 10b-5 class action described immediately above. The parties agreed to stay the derivative case pending resolution of defendants’ motion to dismiss the securities case, which the court granted in part and denied in part on March 22, 2021.\nPlaintiff filed an amended complaint on June 4, 2021. The derivative suit is brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf, against our Chief Technology Officer, our Chief Executive Officer, and the estate of Mark Hurd. Plaintiff claims that the alleged actions described in the class action discussed above caused harm to Oracle, and that defendants violated their fiduciary duties of candor, good faith, loyalty, and due care by failing to prevent this alleged harm. Plaintiff also brings derivative claims for violations of federal securities laws.  Plaintiffs seek a ruling that this case may proceed as a derivative action, a finding that defendants are liable for breaching their fiduciary duties, damages, an order directing defendants to enact corporate reforms, attorneys’ fees and costs, and unspecified relief. On June 14, 2021, the court “so ordered” a stipulation from the parties, staying this case pending resolution of the 10b-5 action.\n109\nORACLE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n—(Continued)\nMay 31,\n2021\nWhile Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations\n.\nDerivative Litigation Concerning Oracle’s Board Composition and Hiring Practices\nOn July 2 and 10, 2020, two alleged stockholders filed derivative lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf, and thereafter, filed a consolidated complaint on August 21, 2020. On July 30, 2020, a third alleged stockholder filed a derivative lawsuit in the same court. On October 16, 2020, defendants moved to consolidate all these actions, and the court granted this motion on November 30, 2020.\nOn December 7, 2020, plaintiffs filed a consolidated derivative complaint against all members of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, interest, corporate governance changes, disgorgement, restitution, punitive damages, and an award of attorneys’ fees, expert fees, and costs. Plaintiffs allege that: (a) defendants breached their fiduciary duties by permitting Oracle to violate anti-discrimination laws and Oracle’s own policies, failing to ensure sufficient diversity on the board, failing to ensure an independent board chairman, rehiring Ernst & Young LLP as Oracle’s auditors, and by breaching the HP Settlement Agreement (discussed above); (b)  defendants made false and misleading statements in Oracle’s proxy statements; (c) defendants received unjust compensation and were unjustly enriched; (d) defendants aided and abetted this conduct; and (e) our Chief Technology Officer and our Chief Executive Officer are liable for abuse of control. On January 6, 2021, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. On May 24, 2021, the court granted defendants’ motion. Regarding the claims concerning Oracle’s proxy statements, the court granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint within 30 days. Regarding the remaining claims, the court granted plaintiffs leave to re-file those claims in Delaware Chancery Court.\nWhile Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nOther Litigation\nWe are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any.\n110\nSCHEDULE II\nORACLE CORPORATION\nVALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS"
