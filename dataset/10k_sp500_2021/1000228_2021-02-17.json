We\nbelieve we are the world’s largest provider of health care products and services primarily to office-\nbased dental and medical practitioners, as well as alternate sites of care.\nOur philosophy is grounded in our\ncommitment to help customers operate a more efficient and successful business so\nthe practitioner can provide\nbetter clinical care.\nWith more than 88 years of experience distributing health care products, we have built a vast set of small,\nmid-sized\nand large customers in the dental and medical markets, serving more than one\nmillion customers worldwide across\ndental practices and laboratories and physician practices, as well as government,\ninstitutional health care clinics and\nother alternate care clinics.\nWe are headquartered in Melville, New York,\nemploy more than 19,000 people (of which approximately 9,800 are\nbased outside the United States) and have operations or affiliates in 31 countries and\nterritories, including the\nUnited States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China,\nthe Czech Republic, France, Germany,\nHong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New\nZealand, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,\nThailand, United Arab Emirates\nand the United Kingdom.\nThis broad global footprint has evolved over time through our organic success as well\nas\nthrough contribution from strategic acquisitions.\nOur business extends far beyond our supply chain capabilities across\nthe globe. We provide a wide breadth\nof products, value-added solutions and support to customers, including\nconsumables and equipment. Through\nHenry Schein One, we offer dental practice management, patient engagement\nand demand creation software\nsolutions. We also offer a broad range of financial services for our customers to help them operate and expand their\nbusiness operations. We believe our hands-on consultative approach to support practice decision-making is a key\ndifferentiator for our business.\nWe offer\na comprehensive selection of more than 120,000 branded products\nand Henry Schein private brand\nproducts in stock, as well as more than 180,000 additional products\navailable as special-order items.\nAs the market continues to evolve toward solutions that offer ease and convenience for\nordering products and\ncommunicating with our solutions teams, we are investing in digital enhancements\nto our e-commerce platforms\nand our web capabilities.\nWe have established over 3.5 million square feet of space in 28 strategically located distribution centers around the\nworld to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating\nefficiency.\nOur infrastructure allows us\nto provide rapid and accurate order fulfillment. Historically, approximately 99% of items have been shipped\nwithout back ordering and were shipped on the same business day the order\nis received.\nDue to the significant\nincrease in demand for personal protective equipment (“PPE”), as a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, during the\nyear ended December 26, 2020, approximately 93% of items ordered\nwere shipped without back ordering and 90%\nwere shipped on the same business day the order was received.\nAs the demand for PPE stabilizes, we expect our\npercentage of items shipped without back ordering and shipped on the\nsame day to return to historic levels.\nThis\ninfrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive\nprices, and a strong commitment to\ncustomer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’\nneeds.\nWe conduct our business through two reportable segments: (i) health care distribution and (ii) technology and\nvalue-added services.\nThese segments offer different products and services to the same customer base.\nThe health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global\ndental and medical operating segments.\nThis\ncombined dental and medical segment distributes consumable products,\nsmall equipment, laboratory products, large\nequipment, equipment repair services, branded and generic pharmaceuticals,\nvaccines, surgical products, diagnostic\n4\ntests, infection-control products\nand vitamins.\nOur global dental group serves office-based dental practitioners,\ndental laboratories, schools, government and other institutions.\nOur global medical group serves physician offices,\nurgent care centers, ambulatory care sites, emergency medical technicians, dialysis centers, home health,\nfederal\nand state governments and large enterprises, such as group practices and integrated\ndelivery networks, among other\nproviders across a wide range of specialties.\nWhile our primary go-to-market strategy is in our capacity as a\ndistributor, we also manufacture certain dental specialty products in the areas of implants, orthodontics\nand\nendodontics. We have achieved scale in these global businesses primarily through acquisitions as manufacturers of\nthese products typically do not utilize a distribution channel to serve customers.\nAs an alternative to branded product options, we also market under our own\nprivate label portfolio of cost-effective,\nhigh-quality consumable merchandise products for our dental and medical customers.\nSales of our private label\nproducts generally achieve gross profit margins that are higher than the average margin on the other\nproducts we\nsell.\nOur global technology and value-added services group provides software,\ntechnology and other value-added\nservices to health care practitioners.\nHenry Schein One, the largest contributor of sales to this category, offers\nsoftware systems for dental practitioners. This segment also includes a\nsmall medical software business known as\nMicroMD. In addition, we offer physicians a broad suite of electronic health records,\nintegrated revenue cycle\nmanagement, and patient communication services. Finally, our value-added practice solutions include financial\nservice offerings, which include practice finance solutions such as credit card billing\nand facilitation of customer\nloans (on a non-recourse basis) to acquire equipment and technology, as well as solutions to broker dental practice\ntransitions. We do not take on the liability of such loans but instead receive an origination fee for coordinating\nloans between practice customers and third-party banking groups.\nRecent Developments\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent\nDevelopments” herein for a discussion related to the COVID-19\npandemic and recent corporate transactions.\nIndustry\nThe global health care distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is fragmented and\ndiverse.\nThe industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of\nrelatively small offices to mid-sized and large\ngroup practices ranging in size from a few practitioners to several hundred\npractices owned or operated by dental\nsupport organizations (DSOs), hospital systems, or integrated delivery networks\n(IDNs).\nDue in part to the inability of office-based health care practitioners to store and manage\nlarge quantities of supplies\nin their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to office-based health\ncare practitioners\nhas been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for\nrapid, reliable and substantially complete\norder fulfillment.\nThe purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice are typically\nmade by the\npractitioner, hygienist or office manager.\nSupplies and small equipment are generally purchased from\nmore than\none distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.\nThe health care distribution industry continues to experience growth due\nto demand driven by the aging population,\nincreased health care awareness and the importance of preventative care,\nan increasing understanding of the\nconnection between good oral health and overall health, improved access\nto care globally, the proliferation of\nmedical technology and testing, new pharmacology treatments and\nexpanded third-party insurance coverage,\npartially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage and technological improvements,\nincluding\nthe advancement of software and services, prosthetic solutions and telemedicine.\nIn addition, the non-acute market\ncontinues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic\ntesting from acute care settings to alternate-care\nsites, particularly physicians’ offices and ambulatory surgery centers.\nWe believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors, particularly\nthose with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seeking\nto combine with larger companies that can\nprovide growth opportunities.\nThis consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking\nto acquire\n5\ncompanies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide\nopportunities to serve a broader\ncustomer base.\nIn addition, customer consolidation will likely lead to multiple locations\nunder common management and the\nmovement of more procedures from the hospital setting to the physician\nor alternate care setting as the health care\nindustry is increasingly focused on efficiency and cost containment.\nThis trend has benefited distributors capable\nof providing a broad array of products and services at low prices.\nIt also has accelerated the growth of HMOs,\ngroup practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying\ngroups, which, in addition to their emphasis on\nobtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors capable\nof providing specialized management\ninformation support.\nWe believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect\ndemand for technology solutions, including software, which can enhance\nthe efficiency and facilitation of practice\nmanagement.\nCompetition\nThe distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is\nhighly competitive.\nMany of the health\ncare products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers.\nIn addition, our competitors could\nobtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products.\nManufacturers also could seek to sell\ndirectly to end-users, and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other\ndistributors. In certain parts of the\ndental end market, such as those related to dental specialty products,\nmanufacturers already sell directly to end\ncustomers.\nIn North America, we compete with other distributors, as well as several\nmanufacturers, of dental and medical\nproducts, primarily on the basis of price, breadth of product line, e-commerce\ncapabilities, customer service and\nvalue-added products and services.\nIn the dental market, our primary competitors in the U.S. are the Patterson\nDental division of Patterson Companies, Inc. and Benco Dental Supply\nCompany.\nIn addition, we compete against\na number of other distributors that operate on a national, regional and\nlocal level. Our primary competitors in the\nU.S. medical market, which accounts for the large majority of our global medical\nsales, are McKesson Corporation\nand Medline Industries, Inc., which are national distributors.\nWe also compete with a number of regional and local\nmedical distributors, as well as a number of manufacturers that\nsell directly to physicians.\nWith regard to our dental\nsoftware, we compete against numerous companies, including the Patterson\nDental division of Patterson\nCompanies, Inc., Carestream Health, Inc., Open Dental Software, Inc., PlanetDDS\nLLC, Good Methods Global Inc.\n(d.b.a. CareStack) and Curve Dental, LLC.\nIn other software end markets, including revenue cycle\nmanagement,\npatient relationship management and patient demand generation, we\ncompete with companies such as Vyne\nTherapeutics Inc., EDI-Health Group, Inc. (d.b.a. Dental X Change, Inc.),\nWeave Communications,\nInc., Solutionreach, Inc., ZocDoc, Inc., LocalMed Inc. and Prosites Inc.\nThe medical practice management and\nelectronic medical records market is very fragmented and we compete with\nnumerous companies such as the\nNextGen division of Quality Systems, Inc., eClinicalWorks, Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc., and Epic Systems\nCorporation.\nOutside of the U.S., we believe we are the only global distributor of supplies\nand equipment to dental practices, and\nour competitors are primarily local and regional companies.\nWe also face significant competition internationally,\nwhere we compete on the basis of price and customer service against\nseveral large competitors, including the\nGACD Group, Proclinic SA, Lifco AB, Planmeca Oy and Billericay Dental\nSupply Co. Ltd., as well as a large\nnumber of other dental and medical product distributors and manufacturers\nin international countries and territories\nwe serve.\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe have more than 88 years of experience in distributing products to health care practitioners resulting in strong\nawareness of the Henry Schein\n®\nbrand.\nOur competitive strengths include:\nA focus on meeting our customers’ unique needs\n.\nWe are committed to providing customized solutions to our\ncustomers that are driven by our understanding of the end markets we\nserve and reflect the technology-driven\nproducts and services best suited for their practice needs. We are committed to continuing to enhance these\n6\nofferings through organic investment in our products and our teams, as well through as\nthe acquisition of new\nproducts and services that may help us better serve our customers.\nDirect sales and marketing expertise.\nOur sales and marketing efforts are designed to establish and solidify\ncustomer relationships through personal or virtual visits by field sales representatives,\nfrequent direct marketing and\ntelesales contact, emphasizing our broad product lines, including exclusive\ndistribution agreements, competitive\nprices and ease of order placement, particularly through our e-commerce\nplatforms.\nThe key elements of our direct\nsales and marketing efforts are:\n•\nField sales consultants.\nWe have over 3,450 field sales consultants, including equipment sales specialists,\ncovering major North American, European and other international\nmarkets.\nThese consultants complement\nour direct marketing and telesales efforts and enable us to better market, service\nand support the sale of\nmore sophisticated products and equipment.\n•\nMarketing.\nDuring 2020, we marketed to existing and prospective office-based health care\nproviders\nthrough a combination of owned, earned and paid digital channels, as well\nas through catalogs, flyers,\ndirect mail, and other promotional materials.\nOur strategies included an emphasis on educational content\nthrough webinars and content marketing initiatives.\nWe continue to enhance our marketing technology to\nimprove our targeting capability and the relevance of messaging and offers.\n•\nTelesales.\nWe support our direct marketing effort with approximately 2,250 inbound and outbound\ntelesales representatives, who facilitate order processing, generate new\nsales through direct and frequent\ncontact with customers and stay abreast of market developments and\nthe hundreds of new products,\nservices and technologies introduced each year to educate practice personnel.\n•\nElectronic commerce solutions.\nWe provide our customers and sales teams with innovative and\ncompetitive e-commerce solutions. We continue to invest in our e-commerce platform to offer enhanced\ncontent management so customers can more easily find the products\nthey need and to enable an engaging\npurchase experience, supported by excellent customer service.\n•\nSocial media.\nOur operating entities and employees engage our customers and\nsupplier partners through\nvarious social media platforms, which are an important element of our\ncommunications and marketing\nefforts. We continue to expand our social media presence to raise awareness about issues, engage\ncustomers beyond a sale and deliver services and solutions to specialized\naudiences.\nBroad product and service offerings at competitive prices.\nWe offer\na broad range of products and services to our\ncustomers, at competitive prices, in the following categories:\n•\nConsumable supplies and equipment.\nWe offer over 120,000 Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs, to our\ncustomers.\nWe offer over 180,000 additional SKUs to our customers in the form of special order items.\n•\nTechnology and other value-added products and services.\nWe sell practice management, patient\nengagement, and patient demand creation software solutions to our\ndental customers.\nOur practice\nmanagement solutions provide practitioners with electronic\nmedical records, patient treatment history,\nbilling, accounts receivable analyses and management, appointment\ncalendars, electronic claims processing\nand word processing programs, network and hardware services, e-commerce\nand electronic marketing\nservices, sourcing third party patient payment plans, transition services\nand training and education\nprograms for practitioners. We also sell medical software for practice management, certified electronic\nhealth records (“EHR”) and e-Prescribe medications and prescription solutions\nthrough MicroMD®.\nWe\nhave approximately 800 technical representatives supporting customers\nusing our practice management\nsolutions and services.\nAs of December 26, 2020, we had an active user base of approximately\n94,500\npractices and 374,000 consumers, including users of AxiUm, Dentally®, Dentrix\nAscend®, Dental\nVision®, Dentrix® Dental Systems, Dentrix® Enterprise, Easy Dental®, EndoVision®, Evolution® and\nEXACT®, Gesden®,

installation and technical services for our health care customers.\nOur over 2,000 technicians provide\ninstallation and repair services for: dental handpieces; dental and\nmedical small equipment; table top\nsterilizers; and large dental equipment.\n•\nFinancial services.\nWe offer our customers solutions in operating their practices more efficiently by\nproviding access to a number of financial services and products\nprovided by third party vendors (including\nnon-recourse financing for equipment, technology and software\nproducts; non-recourse patient financing;\ncollection services and credit card processing) at rates that we believe are generally\nlower than what our\ncustomers would be able to secure independently.\nWe also provide consulting services, dental practice\nvaluation and brokerage services.\nCommitment to superior customer service\n.\nWe maintain a strong commitment to providing superior customer\nservice.\nWe frequently monitor our customer service through customer surveys, focus groups and statistical\nreports.\nOur customer service policy primarily focuses on:\n•\nExceptional order fulfillment\n.\nWe ship an average of approximately 128,000 cartons daily.\nHistorically,\napproximately 99% of items have been shipped without back ordering and\nwere shipped on the same\nbusiness day the order is received.\nDue to the significant increase in demand for PPE, as a result\nof\nCOVID-19, during the year ended December 26, 2020, approximately\n93% of items ordered were shipped\nwithout back ordering and 90% were shipped on the same business day\nthe order was received.\nAs the\ndemand for PPE stabilizes, we expect our percentage of items shipped without\nback ordering and shipped\non the same day to return to historical levels.\n•\nComprehensive ordering process\n.\nCustomers may place orders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week via e-\ncommerce solutions, telephone, fax, e-mail, and mail.\nIntegrated management information systems\n.\nOur information systems generally allow for centralized management\nof key functions, including accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, payroll, purchasing, sales,\norder\nfulfillment and financial and operational reporting.\nThese systems allow us to manage our growth, deliver superior\ncustomer service, properly target customers, manage financial performance and\nmonitor daily operational statistics.\nCost-effective purchasing\n.\nWe believe that cost-effective purchasing is a key element to maintaining and enhancing\nour position as a competitively priced provider of health care products.\nWe continuously evaluate our purchase\nrequirements and suppliers’ offerings and prices in order to obtain products at the\nlowest possible cost.\nIn 2020,\nour top 10 health care distribution suppliers and our single largest supplier accounted for approximately\n30% and\n4%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases.\nEfficient distribution\n.\nWe distribute our products from our strategically located distribution centers.\nWe strive to\nmaintain optimal inventory levels in order to satisfy customer demand\nfor prompt delivery and complete order\nfulfillment.\nThese inventory levels are managed on a daily basis with\nthe aid of our management information\nsystems.\nOnce an order is entered, it is electronically transmitted to the distribution\ncenter nearest the customer’s\nlocation for order fulfillment.\n8\nProducts\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net sales\nby principal categories of products offered\nthrough our health care distribution and technology reportable segments:\nDecember 26,\nDecember 28,\nDecember 29,\n2020\n2019\n2018\nHealth care distribution:\nDental

transition services agreement entered into in\nconnection with the Animal Health spin-off, which ended in December 2020.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur objective is to continue to expand as a global value-added provider\nof health care products and services to\noffice-based dental and medical practitioners by increasing their efficiency and success.\nTo accomplish this, we\nwill apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies:\n•\nIncrease penetration of our existing customer base.\nWe have over 1 million customers worldwide and we\nintend to increase sales to our existing customer base and enhance our position\nas their primary supplier.\nWe believe our offering of a broad range of products, services and support, including software solutions\nthat can help drive improved workflow efficiency and patient communications for\npractices, coupled with\nour full-service value proposition, helps us to retain and grow our customer\nbase.\n•\nIncrease the number of customers we serve.\nThis strategy includes increasing the productivity of our field\nsales consultants and telesales team, as well as using our customer\ndatabase to focus our marketing efforts\nin all of our operating segments.\nIn the dental business, we provide products and services to\nindependent\npractices, mid-market groups, and large DSOs as well as community health centers and government\nsites of\ncare.\nLeveraging our broad array of assets and capabilities, we offer solutions to address these\nnew\nmarkets.\nIn the medical business, we have expanded to serve customers\nlocated in settings outside of the\ntraditional office, such as urgent care clinics, retail, occupational health and home health settings.\nAs\nsettings of health care shift, we remain committed to serving these practitioners\nand providing them with\nthe products and services they need.\n•\nLeverage our value-added products and services.\nWe continue to increase cross-selling efforts for key\nproduct lines utilizing a consultative selling process.\nIn the dental business, we have significant cross-\nselling opportunities between our dental software users and our dental distribution\ncustomers.\nIn the\nmedical business, we have opportunities to expand our vaccine, injectables\nand other pharmaceuticals sales\nto health care practitioners, as well as cross-selling electronic health record\nand software when we sell our\ncore products.\nOur strategy extends to providing health systems, integrated\ndelivery networks and other\nlarge group and multi-site health care organizations, including physician clinics, these same value\nadded\n9\nproducts and services.\nAs physicians and health systems closely align, we have increased\naccess to\nopportunities for cross-marketing and selling our product and service portfolios.\n•\nPursue strategic acquisitions and joint ventures.\nOur acquisition strategy is focused on investments in\ncompanies that add new customers and sales teams, increase our geographic\nfootprint (whether entering a\nnew country, such as emerging markets, or building scale where we have already invested in businesses),\nand finally, those that enable us to access new products and technologies.\nMarkets Served\nDemographic trends indicate that our markets are growing, as an\naging U.S. population is increasingly using health\ncare services.\nBetween 2020 and 2030, the 45 and older population is expected\nto grow by approximately 11%.\nBetween 2020 and 2040,\nthis age group is expected to grow by approximately 22%.\nThis compares with expected\ntotal U.S. population growth rates of approximately 7%\nbetween 2020 and 2030 and approximately 12% between\n2020 and 2040.\nIn the dental industry, there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45-and-older segment of\nthe population increases.\nThere is increasing demand for new technologies that allow\ndentists to increase\nproductivity, and this is being driven in the U.S. by lower insurance reimbursement rates.\nAt the same time, there is\nan expected increase in dental insurance coverage.\nWe support our dental professionals through the many SKUs that we offer, as well as through important value-\nadded services, including practice management software, electronic claims\nprocessing, financial services and\ncontinuing education, all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency.\nIn the medical market, there continues to be a migration of procedures from\nacute-care settings to physicians’\noffices and home health settings,\na trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us.\nThere also is the\ncontinuing use of vaccines, injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternate-care\nsettings.\nWe believe we have\nestablished a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the office-based physician\npractitioner.\nAdditionally, we seek to expand our dental full-service model and our medical offerings in countries where\nopportunities exist.\nThrough our “Schein Direct” program, we also have the\ncapability to provide door-to-door air\npackage delivery to practitioners in over 190 countries around the world.\nFor information on revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area, see\nof “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”\nSeasonality and Other Factors Affecting Our Business and Quarterly Results\nWe experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings.\nAs a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of\nsecurities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price\nto decline.\nOur business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations.\nRevenues and profitability generally have been\nhigher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal\nproducts (including influenza vaccine,\nequipment and software products), purchasing patterns of office-based health care practitioners\nand year-end\npromotions. Revenues and profitability may also be impacted by\nthe timing of certain annual and biennial dental\ntradeshows where equipment promotions are offered. In addition, some dental practices\ndelay equipment purchases\nin the U.S. until year-end due to tax incentives.\nRevenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first\nquarter, primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters.\nWe expect our historical seasonality of sales to\ncontinue in the foreseeable future.\n10\nGovernmental Regulations\nWe strive to be substantially compliant with the applicable laws, regulations and guidance described below, and\nbelieve we have effective compliance programs and other controls in place to ensure substantial\ncompliance.\nHowever, compliance is not guaranteed\neither now or in the future, as certain laws, regulations and guidance\nmay\nbe subject to varying and evolving interpretations that could affect our ability to comply, as well as future changes,\nadditions, and enforcement approaches, including in light of political changes.\nFor example, President Biden’s\nadministration has authorized and encouraged a freeze on certain federal\nregulations that have been published but\nare not yet effective, as well as a review of all federal regulations issued during President Trump’s administration.\nChanges with respect to the applicable laws, regulations and guidance described\nbelow may require us to update or\nrevise our operations, services, marketing practices, and compliance programs\nand controls, and may impose\nadditional and unforeseen costs on us, pose new or previously immaterial\nrisks to us, or may otherwise have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nGovernment\nCertain of our businesses involve the distribution, importation, exportation,\nmarketing and sale of, and third party\npayment for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and in this regard, we are subject to extensive local, state,\nfederal and foreign governmental laws and regulations, including as applicable\nto our wholesale distribution of\npharmaceuticals and medical devices, and as part of our specialty home medical supply\nbusiness that distributes and\nsells medical equipment and supplies directly to patients.\nThe federal government and state governments have also\nincreased enforcement activity in the health care sector, particularly in areas of fraud and abuse, anti-bribery\nand\ncorruption, controlled substances prescribing, medical device regulation, and data\nprivacy and security standards.\nGovernment and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care,\nand there have\nbeen efforts to limit such private and government insurance programs, including efforts,\nthus far unsuccessful, to\nseek repeal of the entire United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,\nas amended by the Health Care\nand Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010, as amended\n(the “ACA”).\nIn addition, activities to\ncontrol medical costs, including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement\nrates for pharmaceuticals, medical\ndevices, and/or medical treatments or services, are ongoing.\nMany of these laws and regulations are subject to\nchange and their evolving implementation may impact our operations and our\nfinancial performance.\nOur businesses are also generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations\nthat could impact our financial\nperformance, including securities, antitrust, consumer protection, anti-bribery\nand anti-kickback, customer\ninteraction transparency, data privacy,\ndata security, government contracting and other laws and regulations.\nFailure to comply with law or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOperating, Security and Licensure Standards\nCertain of our businesses involve the distribution, importation, exportation,\nmarketing\nand sale of, and third party\npayment for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and in this regard we are subject to various local,\nstate, federal\nand foreign governmental laws and regulations, including as applicable\nto our wholesale distribution and sale of\npharmaceuticals and medical devices, and, as part of our specialty home medical\nsupply business that distributes\nand sells medical equipment and supplies directly to patients.\nAmong the United States federal laws applicable to\nus are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic\nAct, as amended (“FDC Act”), and\nSection 361 of the Public Health Service Act, as well as laws regulating the\nbilling of and reimbursement from\ngovernment programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and from commercial payers.\nWe are also subject to\ncomparable foreign regulations.\nThe FDC Act, the Controlled Substances Act, their implementing regulations,\nand similar foreign laws generally\nregulate the introduction, manufacture, advertising, marketing and promotion,\nsampling, pricing and\nreimbursement, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, returning or recalling,\nreporting, and distribution of, and\nrecord keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce, and states\nmay similarly\nregulate such activities within the state.\nFurthermore, Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which\nprovides\nauthority to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable\ndiseases, serves as the legal basis for\n11\nthe United States\nFood and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) regulation of human cells, tissues and cellular and\ntissue-based products, also known as “HCT/P products.”\nThe Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 brought about significant\nchanges with respect to\npharmaceutical supply chain requirements.\nTitle II of this measure, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act\n(“DSCSA”), is being phased in over a period of ten years, and is intended\nto build a national electronic,\ninteroperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they\nare distributed in the United States.\nThe law’s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers and dispensers (e.g.,\npharmacies) of prescription drugs took effect in January 2015, and continues to be\nimplemented.\nThe DSCSA\nproduct tracing requirements replace the former FDA drug pedigree requirements\nand pre-empt certain state\nrequirements that are inconsistent with, more stringent than, or in addition\nto, the DSCSA requirements.\nThe DSCSA also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation\nof prescription drug wholesalers\nand third-party logistics providers (“3PLs”), and includes the eventual\ncreation of national wholesaler and 3PL\nlicenses in cases where states do not\nlicense such entities.\nThe DSCSA requires that wholesalers and 3PLs\ndistribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping,\nstorage and handling of\nprescription drugs.\nThe DSCSA requires wholesalers and 3PLs to submit annual reports\nto the FDA, which include\ninformation regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3PL is licensed, the\nname and address of each facility and\ncontact information.\nAccording to FDA guidance, states are pre-empted from imposing\nany licensing requirements\nthat are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or covered\nby the standards established by federal\nlaw in this area.\nCurrent state licensing requirements concerning wholesalers will\nremain in effect until the FDA\nissues new regulations as directed by the DSCSA.\nIn addition, with respect to our specialty home medical supply\nbusiness, we are subject to certain state licensure laws (including state pharmacy\nlaws), and also certain\naccreditation standards, including to qualify for reimbursement from\nMedicare and other third-party payers.\nThe Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 and\nthe Food and Drug Administration Safety and\nInnovation Act of 2012 amended the FDC Act to require the FDA to promulgate\nregulations to implement a unique\ndevice identification (“UDI”) system.\nThe UDI rule phased in the implementation of the UDI\nregulations,\ngenerally beginning with the highest-risk devices (i.e., Class III medical devices)\nand ending with the lowest-risk\ndevices.\nMost compliance dates were reached as of September 24, 2018,\nwith a final set of requirements for low\nrisk devices being reached on September 24, 2022, which will complete\nthe phase in.\nThe UDI regulations require\n“labelers” to include unique device identifiers (“UDIs”), with a content\nand format prescribed by the FDA and\nissued under a system operated by an FDA-accredited issuing agency, on the labels and packages of medical\ndevices (including, but not limited to, certain software that qualifies as a medical device\nunder FDA rules), and to\ndirectly mark certain devices with UDIs.\nThe UDI regulations also require labelers to submit certain information\nconcerning UDI-labeled devices to the FDA, much of which information is publicly\navailable on an FDA database,\nthe Global Unique Device Identification Database.\nThe UDI regulations and subsequent FDA guidance regarding\nthe UDI requirements provide for certain exceptions, alternatives and time extensions.\nFor example, the UDI\nregulations include a general exception for Class I devices exempt from the Quality\nSystem Regulation (other than\nrecord-keeping requirements and complaint files).\nRegulated labelers include entities such as device\nmanufacturers, repackagers, reprocessors and relabelers that cause a device’s label to be applied or modified, with\nthe intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent\nreplacement or modification of\nthe label, and include certain of our businesses.\nUnder the Controlled Substances Act, as a distributor of controlled substances,\nwe are required to obtain and renew\nannually registrations for our facilities from the United States Drug Enforcement\nAdministration (“DEA”)\npermitting us to handle controlled substances.\nWe are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements\nrelating to the storage, sale, marketing, handling, reporting, record-keeping\nand distribution of such drugs, in\naccordance with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations,\nand these requirements have been\nsubject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times.\nWe are subject to inspection by the DEA. Certain of our\nbusinesses are also required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and\ncomply with operating and security\nstandards of, the DEA, the FDA, the United States Department of Health\nand Human Services (“HHS”), and\nvarious state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as comparable\nforeign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies, depending on the type of\noperations and location of product\ndistribution, manufacturing or sale.\nThese businesses include those that distribute, manufacture and/or repackage\n12\nprescription pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices and/or HCT/P products, or\nown pharmacy operations, or\ninstall, maintain or repair equipment.\nIn addition, Section 301 of the National Organ Transplant Act, and a number of comparable state laws, impose civil\nand/or criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue (for example,\nhuman bone products) for valuable\nconsideration, while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs\nincurred in procuring, processing,\nstoring and distributing that tissue.\nWe are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products.\nThe\nDEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement\npowers, including the ability\nto suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers,\nseize or order the recall of products and\nimpose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of\nthese laws and regulations.\nForeign\nregulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers.\nEU Regulation of Medicinal and Dental Products\nEU member states regulate their own healthcare systems, as does EU law.\nThe latter regulates certain matters,\nmost notably medicinal products and medical devices. Medicinal products are defined,\nbroadly, as substances or\ncombinations of substances having certain functionalities and may not include\nmedical devices. EU “regulations”\napply in all Member States, whereas “directives” are implemented by the\nindividual laws of member states.\nOn medicines for humans, we are regulated under Directive No. 2001/83/EC\nof 6 November 2001 and EU\nRegulation No. 726/2004 of 31 March 2004.\nThese rules provide for the authorization of products, and regulate\ntheir manufacture, importation, marketing, and distribution.\nIt implements requirements which may be\nimplemented without warning, as well as a national pharmacovigilance\nsystem under which marketing\nauthorizations may be withdrawn, and includes potential sanctions for breaches\nof the rules, and on other bases\nsuch as harmfulness or inefficiency.\nEU Regulation No. 1223/2009 of 30 November 2009\non cosmetic products\nrequires that cosmetic products (which\nincludes dental products) be safe for human health when used under normal\nor reasonably foreseeable conditions of\nuse and comply with certain obligations which apply to manufacturer, importer and distributor. It includes market\nsurveillance, and non-compliance may result in the recall or withdrawal of\nproducts, along with other sanctions.\nIn the European Union, the EU Medical Device Regulation No. 2017/745\n(“EU MDR”) covers a wide scope of our\nactivities, from dental material to X-ray machines, and certain software.\nIt was meant to become applicable three\nyears after publication (in May 2020). However, on April 23, 2020, to allow European Economic Area\n(“EEA”)\nnational authorities, notified bodies, manufacturers and other actors to focus\nfully on urgent priorities related to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the European Council and Parliament adopted Regulation\n2020/561, postponing the date of\napplication of the EU MDR by one year (to May 2021).\nIn the meantime, rules provided for by Directive No.\n90/385/EEC of 20 June 1990\non the approximation of the laws of the member states relating to active implantable\nmedical devices\nremain applicable (in particular to certain software).\nThe EU MDR significantly modifies and intensifies the regulatory compliance\nrequirements for the medical device\nindustry as a whole.\nOnce applicable, the EU MDR will among other things:\n•\nStrengthen\nthe\nrules\non\nplacing\ndevices\non\nthe\nmarket\nand\nrein\nforce\nsurveillance\nonce\nthey\nare\navailable;\n•\nEstablish\nexplicit\nprovisions\non\nmanufacturers’\nresponsibilities\nfor\nthe\nfollow\n-\nup\nof\nthe\nquality,\nperformance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n•\nImprove\nthe\ntraceability\nof\nmedical\ndevices\nthroughout\nthe\nsupply\nchain\nto\nthe\nend\n-\nuser\nor\npatient\nthrough\na\nunique identification number;\n•\nSe\nt\nup\na\ncentral\ndatabase\nto\nprovide\npatients,\nhealthcare\nprofessionals\nand\nthe\npublic\nwith\ncomprehensive\ninformation on products available in the EU;\n•\nStrengthen\nrules\nfor\nthe\nassessment\nof\ncertain\nhigh\n-\nrisk\ndevices,\nsuch\nas\nimplants,\nwhich\nmay\nhave\nto\nundergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market; and\n•\nIdentify importers and distributors and medical device products through\nregistration in a database\n(EudaMed not due until 2022 and after).\n13\nIn particular, the EU MDR imposes stricter requirements for the confirmation that a product meets the regulatory\nrequirements, including regarding a product’s clinical evaluation and a company’s quality systems, and for the\ndistribution, marketing and sale of medical devices, including post-market surveillance.\nMedical devices that have\nbeen assessed and/or certified under the EU Medical Device Directive may\ncontinue to be placed on the market\nuntil 2024 (or until the expiry of their certificates, if applicable and earlier);\nhowever, requirements regarding the\ndistribution, marketing and sale including quality systems and post-market surveillance\nhave to be observed by\nmanufacturers, importers and distributors as of the application date.\nOther EU regulations that may apply under appropriate circumstances\ninclude EU Regulation No. 1907/2006 of 18\nDecember 2006\nconcerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and\nRestriction of Chemicals\n, which\nrequires importers to register substances or mixtures that they import\nin the EU beyond certain quantities, and the\nEU Regulation No. 1272/2008 of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling\nand packaging of substances and\nmixtures (“CLP Regulation”), which sets various obligations with respect\nto the labelling and packaging of\nconcerned substances and mixtures.\nFurthermore, compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future\nrequire us to delay product\nrelease, sale or distribution, or institute voluntary recalls of products we sell,\neach of which could result in\nregulatory and enforcement actions, financial losses and potential reputational\nharm.\nOur customers are also\nsubject to significant federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulation, which\nmay affect our interactions\nwith customers, including the design and functionality of our products.\nCertain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state,\nlocal and foreign laws and regulations,\nincluding with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, handling and\ndisposal of hazardous or potentially\nhazardous substances, and safe working conditions.\nIn addition, certain of our businesses must operate in\ncompliance with a variety of burdensome and complex billing and\nrecord-keeping requirements in order to\nsubstantiate claims for payment under federal, state and commercial healthcare\nreimbursement programs.\nCertain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies\nand are subject to certain regulatory\nrequirements specific to government contractors.\nAntitrust and Consumer Protection\nThe federal government of the United States, most U.S. states and many\nforeign countries have antitrust laws that\nprohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive, as well as consumer\nprotection laws that seek to\nprotect consumers from improper business practices.\nAt the U.S. federal level, the Federal Trade Commission\noversees enforcement of these types of laws, and states have similar government\nagencies. Violations of antitrust or\nconsumer protection laws may result in various sanctions, including criminal\nand civil penalties.\nPrivate plaintiffs\nmay also bring civil lawsuits against us in the United States for alleged\nantitrust law violations, including claims for\ntreble damages.\nEU law also regulates competition and provides for detailed rules\nprotecting consumers.\nHealth Care Fraud\nCertain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar\nforeign) health care fraud and abuse, referral\nand reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.\nSome of these laws, referred to as “false\nclaims laws,” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent\nclaims for reimbursement to\nfederal, state and other health care payers and programs.\nOther laws, referred to as “anti-kickback laws,” prohibit\nsoliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral\nof a patient or ordering,\npurchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services\nthat are\npaid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.\nCertain additional state and federal laws, such\nas the federal Physician Self-Referral Law, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibit physicians and other\nhealth professionals from referring a patient to an entity with which the physician\n(or family member) has a\nfinancial relationship, for the furnishing of certain designated health services\n(for example, durable medical\nequipment and medical supplies), unless an exception applies.\nThe fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to heightened\nenforcement activity over the past few\nyears, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who\nserve as whistleblowers by filing\n14\ncomplaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states)\nunder applicable false claims laws,\nand who may receive up to 30% of total government recoveries.\nPenalties under fraud and abuse laws may be\nsevere, and could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs,\nincluding the loss of licenses and the\nability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could\nhave a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nAlso, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial,\nregulatory or judicial authority in\na manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial\ndefense and settlement\nexpenses.\nEven unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private\nrelators could result in reputational\nharm and the incurring of substantial costs.\nMost states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these\nstate\nlaws have their own penalties, which may be in addition to federal False Claims\nAct penalties, as well as other\nfraud and abuse laws.\nWith respect to measures of this type, the United States government (among others) has expressed concerns\nabout\nfinancial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians\nand dentists on the other.\nAs a result, we\nregularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate\ncompliance.\nWe also are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign\noperations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery\nAct, German anti-corruption laws\nand other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal\nbooks and records, which have been\nthe focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and\nabuse laws and regulations, and\nhave adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial\ncompliance, we cannot predict\nwhether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in\nresponse to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, or failure\nto comply with applicable law, could have\na material adverse effect on our business.\nAffordable Care Act\nThe United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the\nHealth Care and Education\nReconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010, as amended (the “ACA”),\nincreased federal oversight of private\nhealth insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed\nto reduce Medicare expenditures and the cost\nof health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to increased health coverage.\nThe ACA\nalso materially expanded the number of individuals in the United States with health\ninsurance.\nThe ACA has faced ongoing legal challenges, including litigation seeking\nto invalidate and Congressional action\nseeking to repeal some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been\nimplemented. In 2012, the United\nStates Supreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of the\nACA and its individual mandate provision requiring\nthat people buy health insurance or else face a penalty, simultaneously limited ACA provisions requiring Medicaid\nexpansion, making such expansion a state-by-state decision. In addition, one of\nthe major political parties in the\nUnited States remains committed to seeking the ACA’s legislative repeal, but legislative efforts to do so have\npreviously failed to pass both chambers of Congress.\nUnder President Trump’s administration, a number of\nadministrative actions were taken to materially weaken the ACA, including,\nwithout limitation, by permitting the\nuse of less robust plans with lower coverage and eliminating “premium support”\nfor insurers providing policies\nunder the ACA. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017 (the “Tax Act”), which contains a broad range of tax\nreform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates, international\ntax provisions, income tax add-\nback provisions and deductions, also effectively repealed the ACA’s\nindividual mandate by zeroing out the penalty\nfor non-compliance.\nIn the most recent ACA litigation, the federal Fifth Circuit Court\nof Appeals found the\nindividual mandate to be unconstitutional, and returned the case to the District Court\nfor the Northern District of\nTexas for consideration of whether the remainder of the ACA could survive the excision of the individual\nmandate.\nThe Fifth Circuit’s decision was appealed to the United States Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court heard\nargument on the appeal on November 10, 2020, and a decision is anticipated soon.\nAny outcome of this case that\nchanges the ACA, in addition to future legislation, regulation, guidance\nand/or Executive Orders that do the same,\ncould have a significant impact on the U.S. healthcare industry.\nAn ACA provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine\nAct or Open Payments Program (the\n“Sunshine Act”),\nimposes annual reporting and disclosure requirements for drug\nand device manufacturers and\n15\ndistributors with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain\ncovered recipients (including\nphysicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and distributors\nand for group purchasing\norganizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting\nentity.\nThe Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) publishes information from these\nreports on a publicly available website,\nincluding amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital\nidentities.\nAmendments expanded the\nlaw to also require reporting, effective January\n1, 2022, of payments or other transfers of value to physician\nassistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered\nnurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-\nmidwives, and this new requirement will be effective for data collected\nbeginning in calendar year 2021.\nThe\nSunshine Act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries\nmay be required to report\nunder certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by\nthe Sunshine Act, and some of\nthese state laws, as well as the federal law, can be ambiguous.\nWe are also subject to foreign regulations requiring\ntransparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers.\nIn the United States, government actions to seek to increase health-related price\ntransparency may also affect our\nbusiness.\nAnother notable Medicare health care reform initiative, the Medicare Access\nand CHIP Reauthorization Act of\n2015 (“MACRA”), enacted on April 16, 2015, established a new payment framework,\nwhich modified certain\nMedicare payments to “eligible clinicians,” including physicians, dentists and\nother practitioners.\nUnder MACRA,\ncertain eligible clinicians are required to participate in Medicare through the Merit-Based\nIncentive Payment\nSystem (“MIPS”) or Advanced Alternative Payment Models (“APMs”), through\nwhich Medicare reimbursement to\neligible clinicians includes both positive and negative payment adjustments\nthat take into account quality,\npromoting interoperability, cost, and improvement\nactivities.\nData collected in the first MIPS performance year\n(2017) determined payment adjustments that began January 1, 2019.\nMACRA standards continue to evolve, and\nrepresent a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected\nto provide substantial financial\nincentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts, and to increase physician\ninformation technology and\nreporting obligations.\nThe implications of the implementation of MACRA are uncertain\nand will depend on future\nregulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace.\nNew payment and delivery system reform programs,\nincluding those modeled after such federal program, are also increasingly being\nrolled out at the state level through\nMedicaid administrators, as well as through the private sector, which may further alter the marketplace\nand impact\nour business.\nRecently, in addition to other government efforts to control health care costs, there has been increased scrutiny on\ndrug pricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by Congress, the\nPresident, executive branch\nagencies and various states. At the state level, several states have adopted\nlaws that require drug manufacturers to\nprovide advance notice of certain price increases and to report information\nrelating to those price increases, while\nothers have taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription\ndrug affordability boards or multi-\npayer purchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs.\nAt the federal level, several related bills have been\nintroduced and regulations proposed which, if enacted or finalized,\nrespectively, would impact drug pricing and\nrelated costs.\nAs a result of political, economic and regulatory influences, the health care distribution\nindustry in the United\nStates is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes.\nWe cannot predict what further reform\nproposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.\nEU Directive on the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products\nEU law provides for the regulation of the pricing of medicinal products which are\nimplemented by EU member\nstates (Directive No. 89/105/EC of 21 December 1988\nrelating to the transparency of measures regulating the\npricing of medicinal products for human use and their inclusion in the scope of national health insurance\nsystems\n).\nMember states may, subject notably to transparency conditions and to the statement of reasons based upon\nobjective and verifiable criteria, regulate the price charged (or its increases) for authorized\nmedicines and their level\nof reimbursement, or they may freeze prices, place controls on the profitability\nof persons responsible for placing\nmedicinal products on the market, and include or exclude the medicine on\nthe list of products covered by national\nhealth insurance systems.\n16\nEU law does not expressly include provisions like those of the Sunshine Act in\nthe United States, but a growing\nnumber of EU member states (such as France since 2011) have enacted laws to increase the transparency\nof\nrelationships in the healthcare sector. The scope of these laws varies from on member state to another and may, for\nexample, include the relations between healthcare industry players and\nphysicians or their associations, students\npreparing for medical professions or their associations, teachers, health\nestablishments or publishers of prescription\nand dispensing assistance software.\nRegulated Software; Electronic Health Records\nThe FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of\ncomputer software and digital health\nproducts intended for use in health care settings.\nThe 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”), signed into law on\nDecember 13, 2016, among other things, amended the medical device definition\nto exclude certain software from\nFDA regulation, including clinical decision support software that meets certain\ncriteria.\nOn September 27, 2019,\nthe FDA issued a suite of guidance documents on digital health products, which\nincorporated applicable Cures Act\nstandards, including\nregarding the types of clinical decision support tools and other software that are\nexempt from\nregulation by the FDA as medical devices, and continues to issue new guidance\nin this area.\nCertain of our\nbusinesses involve the development and sale of software and related products\nto support physician and dental\npractice management, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign government\nauthorities could determine that one or\nmore of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one\nor more of our businesses to substantial\nadditional requirements with respect to these products.\nIn addition, our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management\nproducts, and our specialty home\nmedical supply business, include electronic information\ntechnology systems that store and process personal health,\nclinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals.\nThese information technology systems may be\nvulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious\nattack, which could require us to\nexpend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related\nsecurity concerns and could involve\nclaims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies.\nFor example, we are directly or indirectly\nsubject to numerous and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and\nregulations that protect the privacy and\nsecurity of personal information, such as the federal Health Insurance Portability\nand Accountability Act of 1996,\nas amended, and implementing regulations (“HIPAA”), the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography\nand Marketing Act, the Telephone Protection and Electronic Protection Act of 1991, Section 5 of the Federal Trade\nCommission Act, the California Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) that\nbecomes effective on January 1, 2023.\nLaws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection are\ncontinually\nevolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. These requirements\nmay not be harmonized, may be\ninterpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction\nto another or may conflict with other\nrules or our practices.\nOur businesses’ failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose\nus to breach\nof contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses,\ncosts for remediation and harm to\nour reputation.\nAlso, evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict\nthe ability of our customers to obtain,\nuse or disseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant\nadditional costs to re-design our\nproducts to reflect these legal requirements, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our operations.\nAlso, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted\nthe pan-European General Data\nProtection Regulation (“GDPR”), effective from May 25, 2018, which increased\nprivacy rights for individuals in\nEurope (“Data Subjects”), including individuals who are our customers, suppliers\nand employees.\nThe GDPR\nextended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors,\nand generally imposes increased\nrequirements and potential penalties on companies, such as us, that offer goods or\nservices to Data Subjects or\nmonitor their behavior (including by companies based outside of Europe).\nNoncompliance can result in penalties of\nup to the greater of EUR 20 million, or 4% of global company revenues, and\nData Subjects may seek damages. EU\nmember states may individually impose additional requirements and penalties\nregarding certain matters, such as\nemployee personal data.\nWith respect to the personal data it protects, the GDPR requires, among other things,\ncompany accountability, consents from Data Subjects or other acceptable legal basis to process the personal data,\nbreach notifications within 72 hours, data integrity and security, and fairness and transparency regarding the\nstorage, use or other processing of the personal data.\nThe GDPR also provides rights to Data Subjects relating\nnotably to information, access, modification, erasure and transporting\nof the personal data.\n17\nIn the United States, the CCPA, which increases the privacy protections afforded California residents, became\neffective January 1, 2020.\nThe CCPA generally requires companies, such as us, to institute additional protections\nregarding the collection, use and disclosure of certain personal information\nof California residents.\nCompliance\nwith the new obligations imposed by the CCPA depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply\nthem, and because the CCPA is relatively new,\nand its implementing regulations were released in August of\n2020,\nthere remains some uncertainty about how the CCPA will be interpreted by the courts and enforced by the\nregulators. If we fail to comply with the CCPA or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the CCPA,\nwe may be subject to certain fines or other penalties and litigation,\nany of which may negatively impact our\nreputation, require us to expend significant resources, and harm our business.\nFurthermore, California voters\napproved the CPRA on November 3, 2020, which will amend and\nexpand the CCPA, including by providing\nconsumers with additional rights with respect to their personal information,\nand creating a new state agency to\nenforce the CCPA and the CPRA.\nThe CPRA will come into effect on January 1, 2023, applying to information\ncollected by businesses on or after January 1, 2022.\nOther states, as well as the federal government, have increasingly\nconsidered the adoption of similarly expansive\npersonal privacy laws, backed by significant civil penalties for non-compliance.\nWhile we believe we have\nsubstantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with\nthe GDPR, CCPA and CPRA requirements,\nour compliance with these measures is likely to impose additional costs on us,\nand we cannot predict whether the\ninterpretations of the requirements, or changes in our practices in response\nto new requirements or interpretations of\nthe requirements,\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and\nmanage patient medical or dental records.\nThese customers, and we, are subject to laws, regulations and industry\nstandards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require the protection of\nthe privacy and security of those records, and our products may\nalso be used as part of these customers’\ncomprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with\napplicable privacy\nand security laws.\nPerceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services,\nor the perceived or actual\nfailure by us or our customers who use our products or services to comply\nwith applicable legal or contractual data\nprivacy and security requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational\nharm, but may also lead to claims\nagainst us by our customers and/or governmental agencies\nand involve substantial fines, penalties and other\nliabilities and expenses and costs for remediation.\nVarious\nfederal initiatives involve the adoption and use by health care\nproviders of certain electronic health care\nrecords systems and processes.\nThe\ninitiatives include, among others, programs that incentivize physicians\nand\ndentists, through MIPS, to use EHR technology in accordance with certain\nevolving requirements, including\nregarding quality, promoting interoperability, cost and improvement activities.\nQualification for the MIPS\nincentive payments requires the use of EHRs that are certified as having certain\ncapabilities designated in evolving\nstandards adopted by CMS and by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health\nInformation Technology\nof\nHHS (“ONC”).\nCertain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale\nof such certified EHR systems and\nother products linked to government supported incentive programs.\nIn order to maintain certification of our EHR\nproducts, we must satisfy these changing governmental standards.\nIf any of our EHR systems do not meet these\nstandards, yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive\nfederal incentive payments, we may be\nexposed to risk, such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws,\nincluding the False Claims Act.\nFor\nexample, on May 31, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a $155\nmillion settlement and 5-year\ncorporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified EHR systems, based\non allegations that the vendor, by\nmisrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body, caused its health care provider customers to submit false\nMedicare and Medicaid claims for meaningful use incentive payments\nin violation of the False Claims Act.\nMoreover, in order to satisfy our customers, our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex\nfunctionality, such as reporting functionality.\nAlthough we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the\neffort\nmay involve increased costs, and our failure to implement product\nmodifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable\nstandards, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOther health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic\nhealth data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic\ntransactions, such as transactions\ninvolving claims submissions to third party payers.\nFailure to abide by these and other electronic health data\n18\ntransmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims,\nsubstantial fines, penalties, and other liabilities\nand expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.\nAdditionally, as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology, the\nability of these connected systems to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged\ninformation becomes\nincreasingly important.\nFor example, on September 6, 2017, the FDA issued final\nguidance to assist industry in\nidentifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical\ndevices to safely and effectively\nexchange and use exchanged information.\nAs a medical device manufacturer, we must manage risks including\nthose associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a\nmedical device.\nThere may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future\nimpacting health care.\nE-Commerce\nElectronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health\ncare supply and distribution\nrelationships.\nOur distribution business is characterized by rapid technological\ndevelopments and intense\ncompetition.\nThe continuing advancement of online commerce requires\nus to cost-effectively adapt to changing\ntechnologies, to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a\nvariety of new services to address the\nchanging demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis, particularly\nin response to competitive\nofferings.\nThrough our proprietary, technologically-based suite of products, we offer customers a variety of competitive\nalternatives.\nWe believe that our tradition of reliable service, our name recognition and large customer base built\non solid customer relationships, position us well to participate in\nthis significant aspect of the distribution business.\nWe continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our Internet presence and capabilities, including\nour online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets.\nInternational Transactions\nUnited States and foreign import and export laws and regulations require us to\nabide by certain standards relating to\nthe importation and exportation of products.\nWe also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the\nconduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct, the U.K. Bribery Act, German\nanti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to\nthe accuracy of our internal books and\nrecords, as well as other types of foreign requirements similar to those\nimposed in the United States.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws\nand regulations promulgated\nthereunder and\npossess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct\nof our business, there can be no\nassurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices\nwill not have a material adverse effect\non our

collaborative workplace culture.\nWe believe our TSMs’ ability to effectively\ncommunicate and cooperate across functional and departmental teams positively\nimpacts our performance.\nEach TSM’s performance is evaluated annually, based on a measure of Team Schein values, with a focus\non open communication.\nOur team’s performance as a whole is evaluated via a culture survey, conducted\nevery two years, distributed to all TSMs, which, among other things,\naddresses collaboration.\nThe results\nfrom our culture surveys are reviewed by senior leaders, reported to the Board\nof Directors and used to\nimplement programs and processes designed to further enhance our culture.\nWe are currently in the\nprocess of further developing our collaborative culture by, among other things, strengthening our existing\ncommitment to diversity and inclusion, as further described below.\n•\nCommitted to\nenhance our\nDiversity\nand Inclusion\n(“D&I”) initiatives.\nWe\nbelieve\na\ndiverse

This\nCouncil drives the Company’s overall\nD&I strategy.\nIn 2020, we launched\na D&I learning\nprogram to educate our\nTSMs on critical\nD&I related\ntopics, and management is incentivized to advance our D&I efforts.\nAdditionally, we promote engagement\nby\nutilizing\nour\nEmployee\nResource\nGroups\nas\nan\ninclusive\nand\ndiverse\nvehicle\nfor\nall\nTSMs\nto\nshare,\nconnect, learn, and develop both personally and professionally.\nWe believe that these efforts will serve as a\ncritical\nstepping stone\nas\nwe\ncontinue to\nstrengthen our\nD&I\ninitiatives in\nan\neffort\nto\nmeet\nthe\nevolving\nneeds of our customers, supplier partners, TSMs, stockholders and society.\n•\nCommitted to the professional development of our TSMs.\nWe have invested in education and skill building,\nand provide formal and informal learning opportunities to our TSMs.\nAll TSMs globally are offered a\nbroad suite of talent and professional development training programs\ntargeted to specific learning\nopportunities based on their current and potential future role within\nthe Company.\nWe also offer\nover 50\norganizational and development training courses designed to aid in the overall development\nand\nadvancement of skills and competencies to enable organizational success.\n•\nSupported talent development and succession planning.\nTalent planning efforts are an integral part of our\ncommitment to ensure a strong leadership pipeline across the organization.

    "text": "Our business operations could be affected by factors that are not presently known\nto us or that we currently\nconsider not to be material to our operations, so you should not consider\nthe risks disclosed in this section to\nnecessarily represent a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company believes that the following\nrisks could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial\nresults, financial condition and/or\nthe trading price of our common stock.\nThe order in which these factors appear does not necessarily reflect\ntheir\nrelative importance or priority.\nCOMPANY RISKS\nOur business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and\nliquidity may be negatively impacted by\nthe effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or similar wide-spread public\nhealth concerns and other\nnatural disasters\n.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the responses of governments\nto it had, and may again have, a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows and may\nresult in a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.\nOur business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and\nliquidity may be negatively impacted by the\neffects of disease outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, similar wide-spread public health concerns,\nand other natural\ndisasters. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have,\nan unprecedented impact on society, worldwide\neconomic activity, and the health care sector (particularly, the dental market). As a global healthcare solutions\ncompany, the COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental responses to it had, and may again have, a material\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows and may result in a\nmaterial adverse effect on\nour financial condition and liquidity. In March and April 2020, the dental market was severely impacted by\nCOVID-19, with many, if not a majority, of practices being closed or open on a limited basis only. Although dental\npractice openings and patient volume recovery in the United States and\nmany other countries have rebounded faster\nthan originally anticipated, patient volumes have remained below pre-COVID-19\nlevels.\nMaterial uncertainty\nremains and the potential for additional significant resurgences of COVID-19\ncould cause a significant reduction in\ndental practice openings and patient volume recovery, or further delay the return to normal operations. Even\nafter\nCOVID-19 has subsided, we may again experience material adverse\nimpacts to our business, results of operations\nand cash flows as a result of, among other things, its global economic\nimpact, including any recession that may\noccur in the future, or a prolonged period of economic slowdown or the\nreluctance of patients to return for elective\ndental or medical care. The impacts and potential impacts from\nthe COVID-19 pandemic include, but are not\nlimited to:\n•\nSignificant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for certain of our products.\nFor example, in\nMarch and April 2020, many dental offices in the United States performed only emergency procedures,\nand\nrescheduled wellness exams and elective procedures. Dental offices in other countries\nalso experienced closures or\nrestricted operations, as did medical offices around the world. Such closures and restrictions\nimpacted our\ncustomers’ spending with us and had, and if reinstated may again have, a material\nadverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations and cash flows. Although dental practice openings and\npatient volume recovery have\nrebounded faster than originally anticipated, capacity constraints\nin offices and demand-side factors may again lead\nto reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for our products. Additionally, significant reduction in\ndemand for certain of our products or customers’ decisions to delay\nthe purchase of large equipment may result in\nus having increased inventory;\n•\nShortage of Certain Personal Protective Equipment (PPE\n). Supply chain disruptions for PPE and an increased\ndemand for these products has resulted, and may continue to result,\nin backorders of certain PPE and a potential\nscarcity in raw materials to make certain PPE. Prices for certain PPE have been\nvolatile. Although we believe that\nmost practices currently are able to access adequate supply, with some exceptions in certain markets depending on\na number of factors, including the progress of the virus and efforts to combat it, we\nstill may be unable to supply\nour customers with the quantity of certain PPE products they demand,\nwhich may lead to our customers seeking\nalternative sources of supply. Furthermore, healthcare professionals’ inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of\ncertain PPE would\nadversely impact our business, results of operations and cash flows,\nand could materially\nadversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. Conversely, we recorded significant charges throughout the\nyear beginning in the second quarter for PPE inventory due to volatility\nof pricing for PPE, and, depending upon\n25\nthe course of the pandemic, if PPE pricing or demand decreases, our\nmargins and the value of certain our PPE\ninventory could be further negatively impacted in future periods, which\ncould result in a material adverse impact on\nour business, results of operations and cash flows and our financial condition\nand liquidity;\n•\nReduction in Peoples’ Ability and Willingness to be in Public.\nRestrictions recommended by several public health\norganizations, and implemented by many local governments, to slow and limit the transmission\nof COVID-19\n(including business closures and restrictions, stay-at-home and similar measures)\nwere implemented and then lifted\nor partially lifted in some locations and reinstituted in others. Ongoing\nsocial distancing ordinances and similar\nrestrictions, and the actual and potential for additional resurgences of COVID-19\nhas in some locations and may in\nother locations result in the re-imposition or tightening of governmental\nsocial distancing and other restrictions,\nand/or cause people to be less willing to go to elective medical and dental\nappointments, which could again\nmaterially adversely affect demand for our products. A lengthened period of materially\nsuppressed demand could\nagain cause material adverse impacts on our business, results of operations\nand cash flows and could materially\nadversely affect our financial condition and liquidity;\n•\nPotential delays in customer payments, or defaults on our customer credit arrangements.\nWe generally sell\nproducts to customers with payment terms. If customers’ cash\nflows or operating and financial performance\ndeteriorate due to the impact of COVID-19, or if they are unable to make scheduled\npayments or obtain credit, they\nmay not be able to pay, or may delay payment to us. Likewise, for similar reasons, suppliers may restrict credit or\nimpose more stringent payment terms. The inability of current and/or\npotential customers to pay us for our products\nand/or services or any demands by suppliers for more stringent payment terms\nmay materially adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and\nliquidity and may limit the amounts we can\nborrow under our trade accounts receivable securitization;\n•\nImpact on third parties’ ability to meet their obligations to us; impact on our ability to meet obligations\nto third\nparties.\nFailure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors,\ncontractors (including third-party shippers), banks, joint venture partners\nand external business partners, to meet\ntheir obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do\nso, which may be caused by their own\nfinancial or operational difficulties, or by travel restrictions and border closures, may materially\nadversely affect\nour business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and\nliquidity. Certain of our contracts with\nsupply partners contain minimum purchase requirements or include rebate provisions\nif we satisfy certain sales or\npurchasing targets that, in certain cases we have not been able to satisfy and in other\ncases we may not be able to\nfully satisfy, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rebate income recognized in fiscal 2020 is less than\nrebates earned over the prior fiscal year. Our failure to satisfy such contractual provisions or renegotiate\nmore\nfavorable terms could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations\nand cash flows;\n•\nNegative impact on our workforce and impact of adapted business practices.\nThe spread of COVID-19 caused us\nto implement temporary cost reduction measures (including a payroll\ncost reduction plan centered around\nfurloughs, reduced pay and work hours, voluntary unpaid time off, suspension of Company\ncontributions to certain\nretirement plans and job reductions), all of which have now ended (except\nfor a small number of TSMs who remain\non furlough), modify our business practices (including employee\ntravel, employee work locations, and cancellation\nof physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and\nwe may take further actions as may be required\nby government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests\nof our employees. As the COVID-19\npandemic continues to unfold, we will continue to evaluate appropriate actions\nfor our business. Many of our\nemployees shifted abruptly to working remotely and our non-essential workers\nwho are able to work from home\ncontinue to do so. An extended period of modified business practices\nand remote work arrangements could have a\nnegative impact on employee morale, strain our business continuity plans,\nintroduce operational risk (including but\nnot limited to cybersecurity risks), and impair our ability to efficiently operate our\nbusiness;\n•\nSignificant changes in political conditions.\nSignificant changes in political conditions in markets in which\nwe\npurchase and distribute our products have occurred and are expected to\ncontinue at least during the pendency of the\npandemic, including quarantines, governmental or regulatory actions, closures\nor other restrictions that limit or\nclose our operating facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to\ntravel or perform necessary business functions, or\notherwise constrain the operations of our business partners, suppliers, or\ncustomers, which may materially\nadversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition\nand liquidity;\n26\n•\nPotential impact on our ability to meet obligations under credit facilities.\nAlthough in fiscal 2020 we entered into\namendments to our material credit facilities to, among other things,\nextend the maturity dates and temporarily\nprovide additional flexibility under certain covenants, an extended negative\nimpact of COVID-19 on our business,\nresults of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity could\nimpact our ability to meet our obligations\nunder credit facilities or outstanding long term debt, which contain\nmaximum leverage ratios, and customary\nrepresentations, warranties and affirmative covenants;\n•\nVolatility\nin the financial markets.\nVolatility\nin the financial markets may materially adversely affect the\navailability and cost of credit to us;\n•\nRefocusing management resources to mitigate effects of COVID-19\n. Our management is focused on mitigating the\neffects of COVID-19, which has required, and may continue to require for the duration of\nthe pandemic, a large\ninvestment of time and resources across the Company, and may delay certain strategic and other plans, which could\nmaterially adversely affect our business;\n•\nPotential\nincreased costs associated with our self-insured medical insurance programs.\nWe may incur significant\nemployee health care costs under our self-insurance medical insurance programs\nif a large number of our\nemployees and/or their covered family members become ill from COVID-19;\nand\n•\nReputational risk associated with response to COVID-19.\nIf we do not respond appropriately to the COVID-19\npandemic, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate, we could\nsuffer damage to our reputation\nand our brands, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed below, any of which could have a material\nadverse effect on us.\nWe are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products.\nWe obtain substantially all of the products we distribute from third parties, with whom we generally do not have\nlong-term contracts. While there is typically more than one source of\nsupply, some key suppliers, in the aggregate,\nsupply a significant portion of the products we sell.\nIn 2020, our top 10 health care distribution suppliers and\nour\nsingle largest supplier accounted for approximately 30%\nand 4%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases.\nBecause of our dependence upon such suppliers, our operations are\nsubject to the suppliers’ ability and willingness\nto supply products in the quantities that we require, and the risks include delays\ncaused by interruption in\nproduction based on conditions outside of our control, including\na supplier’s failure to comply with applicable\ngovernment requirements (which may result in product recalls and/or\ncessation of sales) or an interruption in the\nsuppliers’ manufacturing capabilities. In the event of any such\ninterruption in supply, we would need to identify and\nobtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis. There is no guarantee\nthat we would be able to obtain such\nalternative sources of supply on a timely basis, if at all, and an extended interruption\nin supply, particularly of a\nhigh sales volume product, could result in a significant disruption in our sales\nand operations, as well as damage to\nour relationships with customers and our reputation.\nOur\nfuture\ngrowth\n(especially\nfor\nour\ntechnology\nand\nvalue-added\nservices\nsegment)\nis\ndependent\nupon\nour\nability\nto\ndevelop\nor\nacquire\nand\nmaintain\nand\nprotect\nnew\nproducts\nand\ntechnologies\nthat\nachieve\nmarket\nacceptance with acceptable margins.\nOur future success\ndepends on our ability\nto timely develop (or\nobtain the right\nto sell) competitive\nand innovative\n(particularly\nfor\nour\ntechnology\nand\nvalue-added\nservices\nsegment),\nproducts\nand\nservices\nand\nto\nmarket\nthem\nquickly and\ncost-effectively.\nOur ability\nto anticipate\ncustomer needs\nand emerging\ntrends and\ndevelop or\nacquire\nnew products,\nservices and\ntechnologies at\ncompetitive prices\nrequires significant\nresources, including\nemployees\nwith the requisite skills, experience\nand expertise, particularly in our\ntechnology segment, including dental practice\nmanagement, patient engagement and demand creation software solutions.\nThe failure to successfully address these\nchallenges\ncould\nmaterially\ndisrupt\nour\nsales\nand\noperations.\nAdditionally,\nour\nsoftware\nand\ne-services\nproducts,\nlike\nsoftware\nproducts generally,\nmay\ncontain\nundetected errors\nor\nbugs\nwhen introduced\nor\nas\nnew\nversions\nare\nreleased. Any such defective\nsoftware may result in\nincreased expenses related to the\nsoftware and could adversely\naffect\nour\nrelationships\nwith\ncustomers\nas\nwell\nas\nour\nreputation.\nWhile\ncertain\nsoftware\nand\ne-services\nthat\nwe\n27\ndevelop are protected\nunder patent law,\nwe rely primarily\nupon copyright, trademark\nand trade secret\nlaws, as well\nas contractual and\ncommon law protections and\nconfidentiality obligations. We\ncannot provide assurance that\nsuch\nlegal protections will be\navailable, adequate or enforceable in\na timely manner to protect\nour software or e-services\nproducts.\nOur expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves\nrisks and may not result in the benefits and\nrevenue growth we expect.\nOne of our business strategies has been to expand our domestic and\ninternational markets in part through\nacquisitions and joint ventures, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions\nand enter into joint ventures in the\nfuture. Such transactions require significant management attention,\nmay place significant demands on our\noperations, information systems and financial resources, and there\nis risk that one or more may not succeed. We\ncannot be sure, for example, that we will achieve the benefits of revenue\ngrowth that we expect from these\nacquisitions or joint ventures or that we will avoid unforeseen additional\ncosts or expenses.\nOur ability to\nsuccessfully implement our acquisition and joint venture strategy depends\nupon, among other things, the following:\n•\nthe availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at\nacceptable prices;\n•\nour ability to consummate such transactions, which could potentially\nbe prohibited due to U.S. or\nforeign antitrust regulations;\n•\nthe liquidity of our investments and the availability of financing on\nacceptable terms;\n•\nour ability to retain customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or\njoint ventures;\n•\nour ability to retain, recruit and incentivize the management of the companies\nwe acquire; and\n•\nour ability to successfully integrate these companies’ operations, services,\nproducts and personnel with\nour culture, management policies, internal procedures, working capital\nmanagement, financial and\noperational controls and strategies.\nFurthermore, some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may give\nrise to an obligation to make contingent\npayments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations, which payments\ncould have material adverse impacts on our\nfinancial results individually or in the aggregate.\nCertain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to\nwhich we are a party may discourage\nthird parties from seeking to acquire us that might otherwise result in\nour stockholders receiving a premium\nover the market price of their shares.\nThe provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may\nmake it more difficult for a third-party to\nacquire us, may discourage acquisition bids and may impact the price\nthat certain investors might be willing to pay\nin the future for shares of our common stock.\nThese provisions, among other things require:\n•\nthe affirmative vote of the holders of at least 60% of the shares of common stock\nentitled to vote to\napprove a merger, consolidation, or a sale, lease, transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our\nassets; and\n•\nthe affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our common stock entitled\nto vote to (i)\nremove a director; and (ii) to amend or repeal our by-laws, with certain limited\nexceptions.\nIn addition, certain of our employee incentive plans provide for accelerated\nvesting of stock options and other\nawards upon termination without cause within two years following a change\nin control, or grant the plan committee\ndiscretion to accelerate awards upon a change of control.\nFurther, certain agreements between us and our executive\nofficers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those\nexecutive officers are terminated\nwithout cause by us or if they terminate for good reason, in each case within\ntwo years following a change in\ncontrol or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control\nor after the first public\nannouncement of the pendency of the change in control.\n28\nINDUSTRY RISKS\nThe health care products distribution industry is highly competitive\n(including, without limitation, competition\nfrom third-party online commerce sites) and consolidating, and we may not\nbe able to compete successfully.\nWe compete with numerous companies, including several major manufacturers and distributors. Some of our\ncompetitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which\ncould allow them to compete more\nsuccessfully. Most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships\nwith several distributors. Competitors could obtain exclusive rights\nto market particular products, which we would\nthen be unable to market. Manufacturers also could increase their\nefforts to sell directly to end-users and thereby\neliminate or reduce our role in distribution. Industry consolidation among health\ncare product distributors and\nmanufacturers, price competition, product unavailability, whether due to our inability to gain access to products or\nto interruptions in manufacturing supply, or the emergence of new competitors, also could increase competition.\nConsolidation has also increased among manufacturers of health care\nproducts, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our margins and product availability. We\ncould be subject to charges and financial losses in the\nevent we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments contained\nin some of our contracts. Additionally,\ntraditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged\nby electronic online commerce\nsolutions. The continued advancement of online commerce by third\nparties will require us to cost-effectively adapt\nto changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business\n(including with additional\nvalue-added services) to address changing demands of consumers and\nour customers on a timely basis. The\nemergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and\neffectively respond to changes on a\ntimely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe repeal or judicial prohibition on implementation of the Affordable Care Act\ncould materially adversely\naffect our business.\nThe U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and\nEducation Reconciliation\nAct, each enacted in March 2010, as amended (the “ACA”), greatly expanded\nhealth insurance coverage in the\nUnited States and has been the target of litigation and Congressional reform efforts since its adoption.\nThe U.S.\nSupreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of the ACA and its\nindividual mandate provision in 2012,\nsimultaneously limited ACA provisions requiring Medicaid expansion,\nmaking such expansion a state-by-state\ndecision.\nIn 2017, the U.S. Congress effectively repealed the ACA’s\nindividual mandate provision by eliminating\nthe financial penalty for non-compliance.\nIn the most recent ACA litigation, a federal appeals court found\nthe\nindividual mandate to be unconstitutional, and returned the case to a lower federal\ncourt for consideration of\nwhether the remainder of the ACA could survive the excision of the individual\nmandate.\nThis decision was\nappealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and a decision is expected soon.\nAny outcome of this case that changes the\nACA, in addition to future legislation, regulation, guidance and/or Executive\nOrders that do the same, could have a\nsignificant impact on the U.S. healthcare industry and our operations.\nThe health care industry is experiencing changes due to political, economic and\nregulatory influences that could\nmaterially adversely affect our business.\nThe health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing\npolitical, economic and regulatory influences.\nIn recent years, the health care industry has undergone, and is in the process of undergoing, significant\nchanges\ndriven by various efforts to reduce costs, including, among other factors: trends\ntoward managed care; collective\npurchasing arrangements and consolidation among office-based health care practitioners; and\nchanges in\nreimbursements to customers, including increased attention to value-based payment\narrangements, as well as\ngrowing enforcement activities (and related monetary recoveries) by governmental\nofficials. Both our profitability\nand the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws\nand regulations reducing\nreimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and devices,\nand/or medical treatments or services, or\nchanges to the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined.\nIf we are unable to react effectively to\nthese and other changes in the health care industry, our business could be materially adversely affected.\n29\nExpansion of group purchasing organizations (“GPO”) or provider networks\nand the multi-tiered costing\nstructure may place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe medical products industry is subject to a multi-tiered costing structure,\nwhich can vary by manufacturer and/or\nproduct. Under this structure, certain institutions can obtain more\nfavorable prices for medical products than we are\nable to obtain. The multi-tiered costing structure continues to expand\nas many large integrated health care providers\nand others with significant purchasing power, such as GPOs, demand more favorable pricing terms.\nAdditionally,\nthe formation of provider networks and GPOs may shift purchasing decisions\nto entities or persons with whom we\ndo not have a historical relationship and may threaten our ability to compete\neffectively, which could in turn\nnegatively impact our financial results. Although we are seeking to obtain similar\nterms from manufacturers to\naccess lower prices demanded by GPO contracts or other contracts, and to\ndevelop relationships with existing and\nemerging provider networks and GPOs, we cannot guarantee that such terms will\nbe obtained or contracts executed.\nIncreases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers\ncould harm our business.\nShipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business. We ship almost all of our orders through third-\nparty delivery services, and typically bear the cost of shipment. Accordingly, any significant increase in shipping\nrates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating\nresults. Similarly, strikes\nor other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating\nexpenses to rise and materially adversely\naffect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis.\nMACRO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL RISKS\nUncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could\nmaterially adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nUncertain global macro-economic and political conditions that affect the economy\nand the economic outlook of the\nUnited States, Europe, Asia and other parts of the world could materially adversely\naffect our results of operations\nand financial condition. These uncertainties, include, among other things:\n•\nelection results;\n•\nchanges to laws and policies governing foreign trade (including, without\nlimitation, the United States-\nMexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement of December\n2020, and other international trade agreements);\n•\ngreater restrictions on imports and exports;\n•\nsupply chain disruptions due to social issues;\n•\nchanges in laws and policies governing health care or data privacy;\n•\ntariffs and sanctions;\n•\nchanges to the relationship between the United States and China;\n•\nsovereign debt levels;\n•\nthe inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived\neconomic, currency or\nbudgetary crises or issues;\n•\nconsumer confidence;\n•\nunemployment levels (and a corresponding increase in the uninsured\nand underinsured population);\n•\nchanges in regulatory and tax regulations;\n•\nincreases in interest rates;\n•\navailability of capital;\n•\nincreases in fuel and energy costs;\n•\nthe effect of inflation on our ability to procure products and our ability to increase\nprices over time;\n•\nchanges in tax rates and the availability of certain tax deductions;\n•\nincreases in health care costs;\n•\nthe threat or outbreak of war, terrorism or public unrest; and\n•\nchanges in laws and policies governing manufacturing, development and\ninvestment in territories and\ncountries where we do business.\n30\nAdditionally, changes in government, government debt and/or budget crises may lead to reductions in government\nspending in certain countries, which could reduce overall health care spending,\nand/or higher income or corporate\ntaxes, which could depress spending overall. Recessionary conditions and depressed\nlevels of consumer and\ncommercial spending may also cause customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products\nand may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change their terms of sale.\nWe generally sell products to\ncustomers with payment terms. If customers’ cash flow or operating and\nfinancial performance deteriorate, or if\nthey are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not\nbe able to, or may delay, payment to us.\nLikewise, for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment\nterms.\nREGULATORY\nAND LITIGATION RISKS\nFailure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements\ncould materially adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nThe laws and regulations that govern our business and operations are\nsubject to varying and evolving\ninterpretations, future changes, additions, and enforcement approaches\n(including in light of political changes, such\nas with respect to the new administration of President Biden) that\naffect our ability to comply.\nFor example,\nPresident Biden’s administration has authorized and encouraged a freeze on certain federal regulations\nthat have\nbeen published but are not yet effective, as well as a review of all federal regulations\nissued during President\nTrump’s administration.\nChanges with respect to the applicable laws and regulations may\nrequire us to update or\nrevise our operations, services, marketing practices, and compliance programs\nand controls, and may impose\nadditional and unforeseen costs on us, pose new or previously immaterial\nrisks to us, or may otherwise have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\nThere can be no assurance that current and future government\nregulations\nwill not adversely affect our business, and we cannot predict new regulatory priorities,\nthe form, content or timing\nof regulatory actions, and their impact on the health care industry and on\nour business and operations.\nGlobal efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on\nproduct pricing.\nIn the United\nStates, in addition to other government efforts to control health care costs, there has been\nincreased scrutiny on drug\npricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by Congress, the President,\nexecutive branch agencies\nand various states. At the state level, several states have adopted\nlaws that require drug manufacturers to provide\nadvance notice of certain price increases and to report information\nrelating to those price increases, while others\nhave taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription drug\naffordability boards or multi-payer\npurchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs.\nAt the federal level, several related bills have been\nintroduced and regulations proposed which, if enacted or finalized,\nrespectively, would impact drug pricing and\nrelated costs.\nUnder the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, we are required to collect\nand report detailed information regarding\ncertain financial relationships we have with covered recipients, such as\nphysicians, dentists and teaching hospitals.\nWe or our subsidiaries may be required to report information under certain state transparency laws that address\ncircumstances not covered by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and\nsome of these state laws, as well as the\nfederal law, can be ambiguous.\nWe are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain\ninteractions between suppliers and their customers.\nWhile we believe we have substantially compliant programs\nand controls in place satisfying the above laws and requirements,\nsuch compliance imposes additional costs on us\nand the requirements are sometimes ambiguous.\nIn the United States, government actions to seek to increase\nhealth-related price transparency may also affect our business.\n31\nOur business is subject to additional requirements under various local, state,\nfederal and international laws and\nregulations applicable to the sale and distribution of, and third-party\npayment for, pharmaceuticals and medical\ndevices, human cells, tissue and cellular and tissue-based products (“HCT/P products”).\nAmong the federal laws\nwith which we must comply are the Controlled Substances Act,\nthe U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as\namended (“FDC Act”), the Federal Drug Quality and Security Act, including\nDrug Supply Chain Security Act\n(“DSCSA”), and Section 361 of the Public Health Services Act. Among\nother things, such laws, and the regulations\npromulgated thereunder:\n•\nregulate the storage and distribution, labeling, packaging, handling, reporting,\nrecord keeping,\nintroduction, manufacturing and marketing of drugs, HCT/P products\nand medical devices, including\nrequirements with respect to unique medical device identifiers;\n•\nsubject us to inspection by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)\nand the U.S. Drug\nEnforcement Administration (“DEA”), and similar state authorities;\n•\nregulate the storage, transportation and disposal of certain of our products\nthat are considered\nhazardous materials;\n•\nrequire us to advertise and promote our drugs and devices in accordance\nwith applicable FDA\nrequirements;\n•\nrequire registration with the FDA and the DEA and various state agencies;\n•\nrequire record keeping and documentation of transactions involving drug products;\n•\nrequire us to design and operate a system to identify and report suspicious\norders of controlled\nsubstances to the DEA;\n•\nrequire us to manage returns of products that have been recalled and subject\nus to inspection of our\nrecall procedures and activities;\n•\nimpose on us reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical, HCT/P product or\nmedical device causes\nserious illness, injury or death;\n•\nrequire manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers and dispensers of prescription\ndrugs to identify and\ntrace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed;\n•\nrequire the licensing of prescription drug wholesalers and third-party\nlogistics providers; and\n•\nmandate compliance with standards for the recordkeeping, storage\nand handling of prescription drugs,\nand associated reporting requirements.\nThe FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of\ncomputer software and digital health\nproducts intended for use in health care settings.\nThe 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”), signed into law on\nDecember 13, 2016, among other things, amended the medical device definition\nto exclude certain software from\nFDA regulation, including certain clinical decision support software.\nCertain of our businesses involve the\ndevelopment and sale of software and related products to support physician\nand dental practice management, and it\nis possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine\nthat one or more of our products is\nsubject to regulation as a medical device, which could subject us or one\nor more of our businesses to substantial\nadditional requirements, costs, and potential enforcement actions or liabilities\nfor noncompliance with respect to\nthese products.\nApplicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations also may require\nus to meet various standards\nrelating to, among other things, licensure or registration, program eligibility, procurement, third-party\nreimbursement, sales and marketing practices, product integrity and\nsupply tracking to product manufacturers,\nproduct labeling, personnel, privacy and security of health or other personal\ninformation, installation, maintenance\nand repair of equipment and the importation and exportation of products.\nThe FDA and DEA, as well as CMS\n(including with respect to complex Medicare reimbursement requirements\napplicable to our specialty home medical\nsupplies business), have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement\nactivities and, in particular, the DEA\nhas heightened enforcement activities due to the opioid crisis in the United States.\nOur business is also subject to\nrequirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations\naffecting our operations abroad.\nThe failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations, or new\ninterpretations of existing laws and\nregulations, or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations,\ncould materially adversely affect our business.\nThe costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable\nstatutes and regulations, as they now exist\nand as they may be modified, could be material.\nAllegations by a governmental body that we have not complied\nwith these laws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially\n32\ncompliant with applicable laws and regulations, and believe we have adequate\ncompliance programs and controls in\nplace to ensure substantial compliance, if it is determined that we have\nnot complied with these laws, we are\npotentially subject to penalties, including warning letters, substantial civil and\ncriminal penalties, mandatory recall\nof product, seizure of product and injunction, consent decrees and suspension\nor limitation of product sale and\ndistribution.\nIf we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance,\nwe could be required\nto make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including\nfines and the loss of licenses.\nNon-compliance with government requirements could also adversely affect our ability\nto participate in important\nfederal and state government health care programs, such as Medicare\nand Medicaid, and damage our reputation.\nThe EU Medical Device Regulation may adversely affect our business.\nThe EU Medical Device Regulation No. 2017/745 (“EU MDR”) was meant\nto become applicable three years after\npublication (in May 2020). However, on April 23, 2020, to allow EEA national authorities, notified bodies,\nmanufacturers and other actors to focus fully on urgent priorities related to the COVID-19\npandemic, the European\nCouncil and Parliament adopted Regulation 2020/561, postponing the date\nof application of the EU MDR by one\nyear (to May 2021).\nThe EU MDR significantly modifies and intensifies the regulatory\ncompliance requirements\nfor the medical device industry as a whole.\nOnce applicable, the EU MDR will among other things:\n•\nStrengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance\nonce they are\navailable;\n•\nEstablish explicit provisions on manufacturers’\nresponsibilities for the follow-up of the quality,\nperformance and safety of devices placed on the market;\n•\nImprove the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain\nto the end-user or patient\nthrough a unique identification number;\n•\nSet up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and\nthe public with\ncomprehensive information on products available in the EU;\n•\nStrengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as\nimplants, which may have to\nundergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market; and\n•\nIdentify importers and distributors and medical device products through\nregistration in a database\n(EudaMed not due until 2022 and after).\nIn particular, the EU MDR imposes stricter requirements for the confirmation that a product meets the regulatory\nrequirements, including regarding a product’s clinical evaluation and a company’s quality systems, and for the\ndistribution, marketing and sale of medical devices, including post-market surveillance.\nMedical devices that have\nbeen assessed and/or certified under the EU Medical Device Directive may\ncontinue to be placed on the market\nuntil 2024 (or until the expiry of their certificates, if applicable and earlier);\nhowever, requirements regarding the\ndistribution, marketing and sale including quality systems and post-market surveillance\nhave to be observed by\nmanufacturers, importers and distributors as of the application date.\nThe modifications created by the EU MDR may have an impact on the\nway we design and manufacture products\nand the way we conduct our business in the European Economic Area.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care\nfraud or other laws and regulations, we\ncould suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations,\nwhich could materially\nadversely affect our business.\nCertain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar\nforeign) health care fraud and abuse, referral\nand reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.\nSome of these laws, referred to as “false\nclaims laws,” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent\nclaims for reimbursement to\nfederal, state and other health care payers and programs.\nOther laws, referred to as “anti-kickback laws,” prohibit\nsoliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral\nof a patient or ordering,\npurchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services\nthat are\npaid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.\nCertain additional state and federal laws, such\nas the federal Physician Self-Referral Law, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibit physicians and other\nhealth professionals from referring a patient to an entity with which the physician\n(or family member) has a\n33\nfinancial relationship, for the furnishing of certain designated health services\n(for example, durable medical\nequipment and medical supplies), unless an exception applies.\nThe fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to heightened\nenforcement activity over the past few\nyears, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who\nserve as whistleblowers by filing\ncomplaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states)\nunder applicable false claims laws,\nand who may receive up to 30% of total government recoveries.\nPenalties under fraud and abuse laws may be\nsevere, and could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs,\nincluding the loss of licenses and the\nability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could\nhave a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nAlso, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial,\nregulatory or judicial authority in\na manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial\ndefense and settlement\nexpenses.\nEven unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private\nrelators could result in reputational\nharm and the incurring of substantial costs.\nMost states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these\nstate\nlaws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal False Claims\nAct penalties, as well as other fraud\nand abuse laws.\nWith respect to measures of this type, the United States government (among others) has expressed concerns\nabout\nfinancial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians,\ndentists and other health care providers,\non the other.\nAs a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices\nas necessary to facilitate\ncompliance.\nIn the EU, the Directive No. 2019/1937 of 23 October 2019\non the protection of persons who report breaches of\nUnion law\nwhich organizes the legal protection of whistleblowers must be implemented by EU\nmember states by\nDecember 17, 2021. This Directive covers whistleblowers reporting breaches\nof certain EU laws, in particular as\nregards public health, the above-mentioned Directive No. 2001/83, Regulation\nNo. 726/2004 or, as regards data\nprotection, the GDPR. The Directive protects a wide range of people and\nincludes former employees.\nAll private\ncompanies with 50 or more employees are required to create effective internal reporting\nchannels.\nWe also are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign\noperations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery\nAct, German anti-corruption laws\nand other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal\nbooks and records, which have been\nthe focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years.\nOur businesses are generally subject to\nnumerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial\nresults, including, without limitation,\nsecurities, antitrust, consumer protection, and marketing laws and regulations.\nIn the EU, both active and passive bribery are criminalized. The EU Council\nFramework Decision 2003/568/JHA\nof 22 July 2003\non combating corruption in the private sector\nestablishes more detailed rules on the liability of\nlegal persons and deterrent sanctions. However, the liability of legal persons is regulated at a national\nlevel.\nFailure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and other\nlaws and regulations, could result in\nsignificant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of\nlicenses and the ability to participate in\nfederal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse\neffect on our business.\nWe may\ndetermine to enter into settlements, make payments, agree to consent decrees\nor enter into other arrangements to\nresolve such matters.\nIntentional or unintentional failure to comply with consent decrees could\nmaterially adversely\naffect our business.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and\nabuse and other laws and\nregulations, and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls\nin place to ensure substantial\ncompliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our\nservices or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or\ninterpretation of laws, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business.\n34\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality\nof sensitive personal information or\nstandards in electronic health records or transmissions, we could\nbe required to make significant changes to our\nproducts, or incur substantial fines, penalties or other liabilities.\nOur businesses that involve physician and dental practice management\nproducts, and our specialty home medical\nsupply business, include electronic information technology systems that\nstore and process personal health, clinical,\nfinancial and other sensitive information of individuals.\nThese information technology systems may be vulnerable\nto breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which\ncould require us to expend\nsignificant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security\nconcerns, and could involve claims\nagainst us by private parties and/or governmental agencies.\nWe are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations\nthat protect the privacy and security of personal information, such as the\nHIPAA, the Controlling the Assault of\nNon-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, the Telephone Protection and Electronic Protection Act of 1991,\nSection 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the CCPA, and the CPRA that becomes effective on January 1,\n2023.\nLaws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection are continually\nevolving and subject to\npotentially differing interpretations. These requirements may not be harmonized,\nmay be interpreted and applied in\na manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict\nwith other rules or our practices.\nOur\nbusinesses’ failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us\nto breach of contract claims,\nsubstantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation\nand harm to our reputation.\nAlso, evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability\nof our customers to obtain, use or\ndisseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant\nadditional costs to re-design our products to\nreflect these legal requirements, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our operations.\nIn addition, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union\nhave adopted the GDPR, which\nincreases privacy rights for individuals in Europe, or “Data Subjects”,\nincluding individuals who are our customers,\nsuppliers and employees.\nThe GDPR extended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers\nand data processors\nand generally imposes increased requirements and potential penalties\non companies, such as us, that offer goods or\nservices to Data Subjects or monitor their behavior (including by\ncompanies based outside of Europe).\nNoncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of EUR 20\nmillion, or 4% of global company revenues.\nData Subjects also have the right to seek compensation for damages.\nEU member states may individually impose\nadditional requirements and penalties regarding certain matters,\nsuch as employee personal data.\nIn the United States, the CCPA, which increases the privacy protections afforded California residents, became\neffective January 1, 2020.\nThe CCPA generally requires companies, such as us, to institute additional protections\nregarding the collection, use and disclosure of certain personal information\nof California residents.\nCompliance\nwith the new obligations imposed by the CCPA depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply\nthem, and because the CCPA is relatively new,\nand its implementing regulations were released in August of\n2020,\nthere remains some uncertainty about how the CCPA will be interpreted by the courts and enforced by the\nregulators. If we fail to comply with the CCPA or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the CCPA,\nwe may be subject to certain fines or other penalties and litigation,\nany of which may negatively impact our\nreputation, require us to expend significant resources, and harm our business.\nFurthermore, California voters\napproved the CPRA on November 3, 2020, which will amend and\nexpand the CCPA, including by providing\nconsumers with additional rights with respect to their personal information,\nand creating a new state agency to\nenforce CCPA and CPRA.\nThe CPRA will come into effect on January 1, 2023, applying to information collected\nby businesses on or after January 1, 2022.\nOther states, as well as the federal government, have increasingly\nconsidered the adoption of similarly expansive\npersonal privacy laws, backed by significant civil penalties for non-compliance.\nWhile we believe we have\nsubstantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with\nthe GDPR, CCPA and CPRA requirements,\nour compliance with these measures is likely to impose additional costs\non us, and we cannot predict whether the\ninterpretations of the requirements, or changes in our practices in response\nto new requirements or interpretations of\nthe requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and\nmanage patient medical or dental records.\nThese customers and we are subject to laws, regulations and\nindustry\n35\nstandards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require the protection of\nthe privacy and security of those records. Our products or services\nmay be used as part of these customers’\ncomprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their\nefforts to comply with applicable data\nprivacy and security laws and contractual requirements.\nPerceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products\nor services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who\nuse our products or services to comply\nwith applicable legal or contractual data privacy and security requirements,\nmay not only cause us significant\nreputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers\nand/or governmental agencies and\ninvolve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses\nand costs for remediation.\nUnder the EU GDPR, health data belong to the category of “sensitive data”\nand benefit from specific protections.\nProcessing of such data is generally prohibited, except for specific exceptions.\nCertain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of electronic\nhealth record (“EHR”) systems and other\nproducts linked to government supported incentive programs, where\nthe EHR systems must be certified as having\ncertain capabilities designated in evolving standards, such as those adopted\nby CMS and by the Office of the\nNational Coordinator for Health Information\nTechnology of HHS (“ONC”).\nIn order to maintain certification of\nour EHR products, we must satisfy the changing governmental standards.\nIf any of our EHR systems do not meet\nthese standards, yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive\nfederal incentive payments, we may\nbe exposed to risk, such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws,\nincluding the False Claims Act.\nWhile\nwe believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications\nand with applicable fraud and abuse laws and\nregulations and that we have adequate compliance programs and controls\nin place to ensure substantial compliance,\nwe cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or resulting changes in our, could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business.\nMoreover, in order to satisfy our customers, our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex\nreporting\nfunctionality.\nAlthough we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve\nincreased costs,\nand our failure to implement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy\napplicable standards, could have a material\nadverse effect on our business.\nAdditionally, as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology, the\nability of these connected systems to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged\ninformation becomes\nincreasingly important.\nAs a medical device manufacturer, we must manage risks including those associated with\nan electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device.\nTax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments, as well as\nforeign jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives\nmay be proposed that could materially\nadversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not\nbe materially\nadversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives. In addition, tax\nlaws and regulations are extremely\ncomplex and subject to varying interpretations. Although we believe that our\nhistorical tax positions are sound and\nconsistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent,\nthere can be no assurance that our tax positions\nwill not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be\nsuccessful in any such challenge.\nWe face inherent risk of exposure to product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims in the\nevent that the use of the products we sell results in injury.\nOur business involves a risk of product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims in the ordinary\ncourse of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant\nin cases as a result of our distribution of\nproducts. Additionally, we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products. As a result, we\ncould be subject to the potential risk of product liability, intellectual property infringement or other claims relating\nto the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities. In addition,\nas our private-label business continues\nto grow, purchasers of such products may increasingly seek recourse directly from us, rather than the ultimate\nproduct manufacturer, for product-related claims. Another potential risk we face in the distribution of our products\nis liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply\nchain.\nIn addition, some of the\nproducts that we transport and sell are considered hazardous\nmaterials. The improper handling of such materials or\n36\naccidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us\nto liability or at least legal action that\ncould harm our reputation.\nGENERAL RISKS\nSecurity risks generally associated with our information systems and our\ntechnology products and services could\nmaterially adversely affect our business, and our results of operations could be\nmaterially adversely affected if\nsuch products, services or systems (or third-party systems we rely on) are interrupted,\ndamaged by unforeseen\nevents, are subject to cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of\ntime.\nWe rely on information systems (IS) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, manage and store customer,\nproduct, supplier and employee data to, among other things:\n•\nmaintain and manage worldwide systems to facilitate the purchase and\ndistribution of thousands of\ninventory items from numerous distribution centers;\n•\nreceive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;\n•\nmanage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of\ncustomers;\n•\nprocess payments to suppliers; and\n•\nprovide products and services that maintain certain of our customers’ electronic\nmedical or dental\nrecords (including protected health information of their patients).\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years, and a\ncyberattack that bypasses our IS security\nsystems (including third-party systems we rely on) causing an IS security breach\nmay lead to a material disruption\nof our IS business systems (including third-party systems we rely on) and/or\nthe loss of business information, as\nwell as claims against us by affected parties and/or governmental agencies, and involve\nfines and penalties, costs\nfor remediation, and substantial defense and settlement expenses. In addition,\nwe develop products and provide\nservices to our customers that are technology-based, and a cyberattack\nthat bypasses the IS security systems of our\nproducts or services causing a security breach and/or perceived security\nvulnerabilities in our products or services\ncould also cause significant loss of business and reputational harm, and actual\nor perceived vulnerabilities may lead\nto claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies.\nIn particular, certain of our practice\nmanagement products and services purchased by health care providers, such\nas physicians and dentists, are used to\nstore and manage patient medical or dental records.\nThese customers are subject to laws and regulations which\nrequire that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our\nproducts may be used as part of these\ncustomers’ comprehensive data security programs, including in connection\nwith their efforts to comply with\napplicable privacy and security laws. Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities\nin our products or services, or the\nperceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products\nto comply with applicable legal\nrequirements, may not only cause reputational harm and loss of business,\nbut may also lead to claims against us by\nour customers and/or governmental agencies and involve damages, fines and\npenalties, costs for remediation, and\nsubstantial defense and settlement expenses. In addition, a cyberattack\non a third-party that we use to manage a\nportion of our information systems could result in the same effects.\nAdditionally, legislative or regulatory action\nrelated to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement\nnew technology products and services.\nFurthermore, procedures and safeguards must continually evolve to meet new\nIS challenges, and enhancing\nprotections, and conducting investigations and remediation, may impose additional\ncosts on us.\nFinally, our business may be interrupted by shortfalls of IS systems providers engaged by our customers, such\nas\nInternet-based services upon which our customers depend to access certain of\nour products.\nOur global operations are subject to inherent risks that could materially\nadversely affect our business.\nOur global operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business. The\nrisks that our\nglobal operations are subject to include, among other things:\n•\ndifficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations;\n•\ndifficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products, establishing channels of distribution and\ncontract\nmanufacturing in foreign markets;\n37\n•\nfluctuations in the value of foreign currencies (including, without limitation,\nin connection with\nBrexit);\n•\nuncertainties relating to the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement of December 2020, including\nfor example potential implementation problems such as border delays, as\nwell as potential changes to\nthe U.K. regulatory scheme to replace EU requirements;\n•\nlonger payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables\nin foreign\njurisdictions;\n•\nrepatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the United States;\n•\nregulatory requirements, including without limitation, anti-bribery, anti-corruption and laws pertaining\nto the accuracy of our internal books and records;\n•\nunexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products and import/export\ntariffs, quotas,\nsanctions or penalties;\n•\nlimitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual\nproperty;\n•\nunexpected regulatory, legal, economic and political changes in foreign markets;\n•\nchanges in tax regulations that influence purchases of capital equipment;\n•\ncivil disturbances, geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political\nor military coups; and\n•\npublic health emergencies, including COVID-19.\nOur future success is substantially dependent upon our senior\nmanagement, and our revenues and profitability\ndepend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as\ncustomers, suppliers and manufacturers of\nthe products that we distribute.\nOur future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of\nmembers of our existing senior\nmanagement, particularly Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of\nMr. Bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have an employment agreement with Mr.\nBergman. We do not currently have “key man” life insurance policies on any of our employees. Competition for\nsenior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting\nand retaining key personnel. Additionally,\nour future revenues and profitability depend on our ability to\nmaintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales\npersonnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers. If we\nfail to maintain our existing relationships with\nsuch persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the\nfuture, our business may be materially\nadversely affected.\nDisruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely\naffect the availability and cost of credit to us.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with\nrespect to indebtedness will depend on\nour operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing\neconomic conditions and financial,\nbusiness and other factors beyond our control. Disruptions in the financial\nmarkets may materially adversely affect\nthe availability and cost of credit to us."

approximately 235 holders of record of our common\nstock and the last reported\nsales price was $70.78.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer\nOur share repurchase program, announced on March 3, 2003, originally\nallowed us to repurchase up to two million\nshares pre-stock splits (eight million shares post-stock splits) of our common\nstock, which represented\napproximately 2.3% of the shares outstanding at the commencement of\nthe program.\nSubsequent additional\nincreases totaling $3.7 billion, authorized by our Board of Directors,\nto the repurchase program provide for a total\nof $3.8 billion of shares of our common stock to be repurchased under this program.\nAs of December 26, 2020,\nwe had repurchased approximately $3.6 billion of common stock (75,563,289\nshares)\nunder these initiatives, with $201.2 million available for future common stock\nshare repurchases.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as previously announced, we have\ntemporarily suspended our share\nrepurchase program in an effort to preserve cash and exercise caution in this uncertain\nperiod and due to certain\nrestrictions related to financial covenants in our credit facilities.\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended December 26, 2020, we did not make any\nrepurchases of our common stock.\nThe\nmaximum number of shares that could be purchased under this

The COVID-19 pandemic has\nnegatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility and\ndisruption of global financial markets. In response, many countries implemented\nbusiness closures and restrictions,\nstay-at-home and social distancing ordinances and similar measures\nto combat the pandemic, which significantly\nimpacted global business and dramatically reduced demand for dental\nproducts and certain medical products\nbeginning in the second quarter\nof 2020. Demand increased in the second half of 2020 resulting\nin slight growth\nover the prior year driven by sales of PPE and COVID-19 related products.\nOur consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions\nmade by us that affect, among other things,\nour goodwill, long-lived asset and definite-lived intangible asset valuation;\ninventory valuation; equity investment\nvaluation; assessment of the annual effective tax rate; valuation of deferred income\ntaxes and income tax\ncontingencies; the allowance for doubtful accounts; hedging activity; vendor\nrebates; measurement of\ncompensation cost for certain share-based performance awards and cash bonus\nplans; and pension plan\nassumptions.\nDue to the significant uncertainty surrounding the future impact of\nCOVID-19, our judgments\nregarding estimates and impairments could change in the future.\nIn addition, the impact of COVID-19 had a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows, primarily in\nthe second quarter of\n2020.\nIn the latter half of the second quarter, dental and medical practices began to re-open worldwide, and\ncontinued to do so during the second half of 2020.\nHowever, patient volumes have remained below pre-COVID-19\nlevels and certain regions in the U.S. and internationally are experiencing an\nincrease in COVID-19 cases.\nAs such,\nthere is an ongoing risk that the COVID-19 pandemic may again materially\nadversely effect our business, results of\noperations and cash flows and may result in a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and liquidity.\nHowever, the extent of the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nAs part of a broad-based effort to support plans for the long-term health of our business\nand to strengthen our\nfinancial flexibility, we implemented cost reduction measures that included certain reductions in payroll,\nsubstantially decreased capital expenditures, reduced corporate spending\nand eliminated certain non-strategic\ntargeted expenditures. As our markets began to recover,\nwe substantially ended most of those temporary expense-\nreduction initiatives during the second half of 2020.\nCorporate Transactions\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we sold an equity investment\nin Hu-Friedy Mfg. Co., LLC (“Hu-Friedy”), a\nmanufacturer of dental instruments and infection prevention solutions.\nOur investment was non-controlling, we\nwere not involved in running the business and had no representation\non the board of directors.\nDuring the fourth\nquarter of 2019, we also sold certain other equity investments.\nIn the aggregate, the sales of these investments\nresulted in a pre-tax gain in 2019 of approximately $250.2 million and an after-tax\ngain of approximately $186.8\nmillion.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020 we received contingent proceeds of\n$2.1 million from the 2019 sale of Hu-\nFriedy resulting in the recognition of an additional after-tax gain of $1.6\nmillion.\nOn February 7, 2019 (the “Distribution Date”), we completed the separation\n(the “Separation”) and subsequent\nmerger of our animal health business (the “Henry Schein Animal Health Business”)\nwith Direct Vet Marketing, Inc.\n(d/b/a Vets\nFirst Choice, “Vets First Choice”) (the “Merger”).\nThis was accomplished by a series of transactions\n45\namong us, Vets\nFirst Choice, Covetrus, Inc. (f/k/a HS Spinco, Inc. “Covetrus”), a\nwholly owned subsidiary of ours\nprior to the Distribution Date, and HS Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary\nof Covetrus (“Merger\nSub”).\nIn connection with the Separation, we contributed, assigned\nand transferred to Covetrus certain applicable\nassets, liabilities and capital stock or other ownership interests relating\nto the Henry Schein Animal Health\nBusiness.\nOn the Distribution Date, we received a tax-free distribution of $1,120\nmillion from Covetrus pursuant to\ncertain debt financing incurred by Covetrus.\nOn the Distribution Date and prior to the Animal Health Spin-off,\nCovetrus issued shares of Covetrus common stock to certain institutional\naccredited investors (the “Share Sale\nInvestors”) for $361.1 million (the “Share Sale”).\nThe proceeds of the Share Sale were paid to Covetrus and\ndistributed to us.\nSubsequent to the Share Sale, we distributed, on a pro rata basis,\nall of the shares of the common\nstock of Covetrus held by us to our stockholders of record as of the close of\nbusiness on January 17, 2019 (the\n“Animal Health Spin-off”).\nAfter the Share Sale and Animal Health Spin-off, Merger Sub consummated the\nMerger whereby it merged with and into Vets\nFirst Choice, with Vets First Choice surviving the Merger as a\nwholly owned subsidiary of Covetrus.\nImmediately following the consummation of the Merger, on a fully diluted\nbasis, (i) approximately 63% of the shares of Covetrus common stock were (a) owned\nby our stockholders and the\nShare Sale Investors, and (b) held by certain employees of the Henry Schein\nAnimal Health Business (in the form\nof certain equity awards), and (ii) approximately 37% of the shares of Covetrus\ncommon stock were (a) owned by\nstockholders of Vets\nFirst Choice immediately prior to the Merger, and (b) held by certain employees of Vets First\nChoice (in the form of certain equity awards).\nAfter the Separation and the Merger, we no longer beneficially\nowned any shares of Covetrus common stock and, following the Distribution\nDate, will not consolidate the\nfinancial results of Covetrus for the purpose of our financial reporting.\nFollowing the Separation and the Merger,\nCovetrus was an independent, publicly traded company on the Nasdaq Global Select\nMarket.\nExecutive-Level Overview\nWe believe we are the world’s largest\nprovider of health care products and services primarily to office-based dental\nand medical practitioners, as well as alternate sites of care.\nWe serve more than one million customers worldwide\nincluding dental practitioners and laboratories and physician practices, as well\nas government, institutional health\ncare clinics and other alternate care clinics.\nWe believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than\n88 years of experience distributing health care products.\nWe are headquartered in Melville, New York,\nemploy more than 19,000 people (of which more than 9,800 are\nbased outside the United States) and have operations or affiliates in 31 countries and territories,\nincluding the\nUnited States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China,\nthe Czech Republic, France, Germany,\nHong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New\nZealand, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,\nThailand, United Arab Emirates\nand the United Kingdom.\nWe have established strategically located distribution centers to enable us to better serve our customers and\nincrease our operating efficiency.\nThis infrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at\ncompetitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables us\nto be a single source of supply for our\ncustomers’ needs.\nOur infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering\nand rapid, accurate and\ncomplete order fulfillment.\nWe conduct our business through two reportable segments: (i) health care distribution and (ii) technology and\nvalue-added services.\nThese segments offer different products and services to the same customer base.\nThe health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental\nand medical operating segments.\nThis\nsegment distributes consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products,\nlarge equipment, equipment repair\nservices, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic\ntests, infection-control\nproducts and vitamins.\nOur global dental group serves office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools\nand other institutions.\nOur global medical group serves office-based medical practitioners, ambulatory\nsurgery\ncenters, other alternate-care settings and other institutions.\nOur global technology and value-added services group provides software,\ntechnology and other value-added\nservices to health care practitioners.\nOur technology group offerings include practice management software\nsystems for dental and medical practitioners.\nOur value-added practice solutions include financial services on a\n46\nnon-recourse basis, e-services, practice technology, network and hardware services, as well as continuing education\nservices for practitioners.\nIndustry Overview\nIn recent years, the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment.\nThis trend has benefited\ndistributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low\nprices.\nIt also has accelerated the\ngrowth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying\ngroups, which, in addition to\ntheir emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors\ncapable of providing\nspecialized management information support.\nWe believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential\nto favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can\nenhance the efficiency and\nfacilitation of practice management.\nOur operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies\nand transactions that we\nundertook to expand our business, domestically and internationally, in part to address significant changes in the\nhealth care industry, including consolidation of health care distribution companies, health care reform, trends\ntoward managed care, cuts in Medicare and collective purchasing arrangements.\nOur current and future results have been and could be impacted by the current\neconomic environment and\nuncertainty, particularly impacting overall demand for our products and services.\nIndustry Consolidation\nThe health care products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is fragmented\nand diverse.\nThe industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of\nrelatively small offices to group practices\nor service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large\nnumber of practitioners who have\ncombined or otherwise associated their practices.\nDue in part to the inability of office-based health care practitioners to store and manage\nlarge quantities of supplies\nin their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to office-based health\ncare practitioners\nhas been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid,\nreliable and substantially complete\norder fulfillment.\nThe purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice are typically\nmade by the\npractitioner or an administrative assistant.\nSupplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more\nthan\none distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.\nThe trend of consolidation\nextends to our customer base.\nHealth care practitioners are increasingly seeking to\npartner, affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals, health systems, group practices or physician\nhospital organizations.\nIn many cases, purchasing decisions for consolidated groups\nare made at a centralized or\nprofessional staff level; however, orders are delivered to the practitioners’ offices.\nWe believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors, particularly\nthose with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seeking to\ncombine with larger companies that can\nprovide growth opportunities.\nThis consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking\nto acquire\ncompanies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide\nopportunities to serve a broader\ncustomer base.\nOur trend with regard to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand\nour role as a provider of products and\nservices to the health care industry.\nThis trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement\nour\nexisting operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with, and\nthus strengthen, the acquired\nbusinesses.\nAs industry consolidation continues, we believe that we are positioned\nto capitalize on this trend, as we believe we\nhave the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure, although\nthere can be no assurances\nthat we will be able to successfully accomplish this.\nWe also have invested in expanding our sales/marketing\ninfrastructure to include a focus on building relationships with decision\nmakers who do not reside in the office-\nbased practitioner setting.\n47\nAs the health care industry continues to change, we continually evaluate possible\ncandidates for merger and joint\nventure or acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand\nour role as a provider of products and\nservices to the health care industry.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue\nany such\nopportunity or consummate any such transaction, if pursued.\nIf additional transactions are entered into or\nconsummated, we would incur merger and/or acquisition-related costs, and there\ncan be no assurance that the\nintegration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful.\nIn response to the COVID-19\npandemic, we had taken a range of actions to preserve cash, including\nthe temporary suspension of significant\nacquisition activity.\nDuring the third and fourth quarters of 2020, as global conditions\nimproved, we resumed our\nacquisition strategy.\nAging Population and Other Market Influences\nThe health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth\ndue to the aging population,\nincreased health care awareness, the proliferation of medical technology\nand testing, new pharmacology treatments\nand expanded third-party insurance coverage, partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance\ncoverage.\nIn addition, the physician market continues to benefit from\nthe shift of procedures and diagnostic testing\nfrom acute care settings to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians’ offices.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau’s International Data Base, in 2020 there were more than six and a half`\nmillion Americans aged 85 years or older, the segment of the population most in need of long-term care\nand elder-\ncare services.\nBy the year 2050, that number is projected to nearly triple to\napproximately 19 million.\nThe\npopulation aged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase by approximately 36%\nduring the same time period.\nAs a result of these market dynamics, annual expenditures for health care\nservices continue to increase in the\nUnited States.\nWe believe that demand for our products and services will grow, while continuing to be impacted by\ncurrent and future operating, economic and industry conditions.\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,\nor CMS,\npublished “National Health Expenditure Projections 2019-2028”\nindicating that total national health care\nspending reached approximately $3.6 trillion in 2018, or 17.7% of the\nnation’s gross domestic product, the\nbenchmark measure for annual production of goods and services in the United\nStates.\nHealth care spending is\nprojected to reach approximately $6.2 trillion in 2028,\napproximately 19.7%\nof the nation’s projected gross\ndomestic product.\n48\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize the significant components of our

allowed us to execute on our plan to reduce our cost structure\nand fund new initiatives\nto drive growth under our 2018 to 2020 strategic plan.\nThis initiative resulted in the elimination of approximately\n4% of our workforce and the closing of certain facilities.\nOn November 20, 2019, we committed to a contemplated initiative, intended\nto mitigate stranded costs associated\nwith the Animal Health Spin-off and to rationalize operations and to provide expense efficiencies.\nThese activities\nwere originally expected to be completed by the end of 2020.\nAs a result of the business environment brought on\nby the COVID-19 pandemic, we are continuing our restructuring activities\ninto 2021. We are currently unable in\ngood faith to make a determination of an estimate of the amount or range of\namounts expected to be incurred in\nconnection with these activities in 2021, both with respect to each major\ntype of cost associated therewith and with\nrespect to the total cost, or an estimate of the amount or range of amounts\nthat will result in future cash\nexpenditures.\nDuring the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December\n29, 2018 we recorded restructuring\ncharges of $32.1 million, $14.7 million and $54.4 million, respectively.\nThe costs associated with these\nrestructurings are included in a separate line item, “Restructuring costs” within\nour consolidated statements of\nincome.\n49\n2020 Compared to 2019\nNet Sales\nNet sales for 2020 and 2019

vitamins.\n(2)\nConsists of practice management software and other value-added products, which are distributed primarily to health care providers, and\nfinancial services on a non-recourse basis, e-services, continuing education services for practitioners, consulting and other services.\n(3)\nCorporate TSA revenues represents sales of certain products to Covetrus under the transition services agreement entered into in connection\nwith the Animal Health Spin-off, which ended in December 2020.\nThe 1.3% increase in net sales for the year ended December 26, 2020\nincludes an increase of 1.4% local currency\ngrowth (0.8% increase in internally generated revenue and 0.6% growth\nfrom acquisitions) partially offset by a\ndecrease of 0.1% related to foreign currency exchange.\nExcluding sales of products under the transition services\nagreement with Covetrus, our net sales increased 1.4%, including local\ncurrency growth of 1.5% (0.9% increase in\ninternally generated revenue and 0.6%\ngrowth from acquisitions) partially offset by a decrease of 0.1% related\nto\nforeign currency exchange.\nSales for the year ended December 26, 2020 benefited from sales of\nPPE and COVID-\n19 related products of approximately $1,298 million, an increase of approximately\n208% versus the prior year.\nFuture PPE and COVID-19 related product sales may be lower than what\nwe have experienced in 2020, which were\ndriven by rising positive COVID-19 cases and practices seeking to ensure\nadequate supply.\nThe 7.8% decrease in dental net sales for the year ended December\n26, 2020 includes a decrease of 7.6% in local\ncurrencies (8.0% decrease in internally generated revenue,\npartially offset by 0.4%\ngrowth from acquisitions) and a\ndecrease of 0.2% related to foreign currency exchange.\nThe 7.6% decrease in local currency sales was due to\ndecreases in dental equipment sales and service revenues of 12.5%,\nall of which is attributable to a decrease in\ninternally generated revenue and a decrease in dental consumable merchandise\nsales of 6.1% (6.5% decrease in\ninternally generated revenue,\npartially offset by 0.4% growth from acquisitions).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic\nadversely impacted our dental business beginning in mid-March of 2020\nas many dental offices progressively\nclosed or began seeing a limited number of patients, resulting in a decrease\nof 41.2% in second quarter dental\nrevenues versus the same period in the prior year.\nHowever, in the second half of the year ended December 26,\n2020, our dental sales began to improve as dental practices resumed activities\nand patient traffic increased.\nGlobal\ndental sales for the year ended December 26, 2020 benefited from sales of\nPPE and COVID-19 related products of\napproximately

as\nsignificantly as our dental business as the decrease in second quarter\nmedical revenues was only 11.2% versus the\nsame period in the prior year. Our medical business rebounded strongly in the second half of the year in part\ndue to\ncontinued strong sales of PPE, such as masks, gowns and face shields,\nand COVID-19 related products, such as\ndiagnostic test kits.\nGlobal medical sales for the year ended December 26, 2020 benefited\nfrom sales of PPE and\nCOVID-19 related products of approximately $807 million, an\nincrease of approximately 490% versus the prior\nyear.\n50\nThe 0.2% decrease in technology and value-added services net sales\nfor the year ended December 26, 2020 includes\na decrease of 0.3% local currency growth (3.2% decrease in internally generated\nrevenue, partially offset by 2.9%\ngrowth from acquisitions) partially offset by an increase of 0.1% related to foreign\ncurrency exchange.\nThe closure\nof dental and medical offices beginning in mid-March of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic\nresulted in a\ndecrease of 15.9% in second quarter technology and value-added services\nrevenues versus the same period in the\nprior year.\nAs dental and medical practice operations, resumed in the second\nhalf of the year, the trend for\ntransactional software revenues improved as more patients visited practices\nworldwide.\nAlthough dental and medical practices continued to re-open globally\nin the second half of the year, patient volumes\nremain below pre-COVID-19 levels.\nAs such, there is an ongoing risk that the COVID-19 pandemic may\nagain\nhave a material adverse effect on our net sales in future periods.\nGross Profit\nGross profit and gross margins for 2020 and 2019 by segment and in total were as follows\n(in thousands):\nGross\nGross\nDecrease\n2020\nMargin %\n2019\nMargin %\n$\n%\nHealth care distribution\n$\n2,448,991\n25.7\n%\n$\n2,717,574\n28.9\n%\n$\n(268,583)\n(9.9)\n%\nTechnology and value-added services\n363,245\n70.6\n370,887\n72.0\n(7,642)\n(2.1)\nTotal excluding Corporate TSA revenues\n2,812,236\n28.0\n3,088,461\n31.2\n(276,225)\n(8.9)\nCorporate TSA revenues\n2,107\n2.8\n2,425\n3.0\n(318)\n(13.1)\nTotal\n$\n2,814,343\n27.8\n$\n3,090,886\n31.0\n$\n(276,543)\n(8.9)\nAs a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks\nthroughout our\nindustry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies.\nAdditionally, we\nrealize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology segment than in\nour health care distribution\nsegment.\nThese higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of\nsoftware products and\nservices, as well as certain financial services.

infection\nprevention solutions.\nOur investment was non-controlling, we were not involved in\nrunning the business and had\nno representation on the board of directors.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we also sold certain other investments.\nIn the aggregate, the sales of these\ninvestments resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $250.2 million\nand an after-tax gain of approximately\n$186.8 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal capital requirements have included funding of acquisitions, purchases\nof additional noncontrolling\ninterests, repayments of debt principal, the funding of working capital needs,\npurchases of fixed assets and\nrepurchases of common stock (which have been temporarily suspended).\nWorking capital requirements generally\nresult from increased sales, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and\npayment terms for receivables and\npayables.\nHistorically, sales have tended to be stronger during the third and fourth quarters and special inventory\nforward buy-in opportunities have been most prevalent just before the\nend of the year, and have caused our working\ncapital requirements to be higher from the end of the third quarter to\nthe end of the first quarter of the following\nyear.\nThe pandemic and the governmental responses to it had a material adverse\neffect on our cash flows in the second\nquarter of 2020.\nIn the latter half of the second quarter and continuing\nthrough year-end, dental and medical\npractices began to re-open worldwide. However, patient volumes remain below pre-COVID-19 levels and certain\nregions in the U.S. and internationally are experiencing an increase in COVID-19\ncases.\nAs such, there is an\nongoing risk that the COVID-19 pandemic may again have a material\nadverse effect on our cash flows in future\nperiods and may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and\nliquidity.\nHowever, the extent of\nthe potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nAs part of a broad-based effort to support plans for the long-term health of our business\nand to strengthen our\nfinancial flexibility, we implemented cost reduction measures that included certain reductions in payroll,\nsubstantially decreased capital expenditures, reduced corporate\nspending and the elimination of certain non-\nstrategic targeted expenditures. As our markets have begun to recover, we ended most of those temporary expense-\nreduction initiatives during the second half of 2020.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, we will\ncontinue to evaluate appropriate actions for the business.\nWe finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations, revolving credit facilities and debt\nplacements.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent\non the continued demand of\nour customers for our products and services, and access to products and\nservices from our suppliers.\nOur business requires a substantial investment in working capital, which\nis susceptible to fluctuations during the\nyear as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands.\nInventory purchase activity is a function of\nsales activity, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and our desired level of inventory.\nWe anticipate\nfuture increases in our working capital requirements.\n57\nWe finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months.\nFunding requirements are based on\nforecasted profitability and working capital needs, which, on occasion, may change.\nConsequently, we may change\nour funding structure to reflect any new requirements.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets,\nand our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with\nsufficient liquidity to meet our currently\nforeseeable short-term and long-term capital needs.\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nOn February 7, 2019, we completed the Animal Health Spin-off.\nOn the Distribution Date we received a tax free\ndistribution of $1,120 million from Covetrus, which has been used to\npay down our debt, thereby generating\nadditional debt capacity that can be used for general corporate purposes, including\nshare repurchases and mergers\nand acquisitions.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $593.5 million for the\nyear ended December 26, 2020, compared to\n$820.5 million for the prior year.\nThe net change of $227.0 million was primarily attributable to lower net income\nand lower distributions from equity affiliates,\nboth resulting from the sale of our equity investment in Hu-Friedy\nin\nthe fourth quarter of 2019, and increased working capital requirements,\nspecifically an increase in inventories due\nto stocking of PPE and COVID-19 related products, and an increase in accounts\nreceivable due to higher sales\nvolume.\nThese working capital increases were partially offset by greater growth\nin accounts payable and accrued\nexpenses.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $115.0 million for the year ended December 26, 2020,\ncompared to $422.3\nmillion for the prior year.\nThe net change of $307.3 million was primarily due to decreased payments\nfor equity\ninvestments and business acquisitions, partially offset by decreased proceeds from\nsales of equity investments.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $181.8 million for the\nyear ended December 26, 2020, compared to\n$363.4 million for the prior year.\nThe net change of $181.6 million was primarily\ndue to increased net proceeds\nfrom bank borrowings and lower repurchases of our common stock,\npartially offset

a $750 million revolving credit\nagreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which\nmatures in April 2022.\nThe interest rate is based on the USD LIBOR\nplus a spread based on our leverage ratio at\nthe end of each financial reporting quarter.\nWe expect the LIBOR rate to be discontinued at some point\nduring 2021, which will require an amendment to our debt agreements to\nreflect a new reference rate. We do not\nexpect the discontinuation of LIBOR as a reference rate in our debt agreements\nto have a material adverse effect on\nour financial position or to materially affect our interest expense.\nThe Credit Agreement also requires, among other\nthings, that we maintain maximum leverage ratios. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains customary\nrepresentations, warranties and affirmative covenants as well as customary negative\ncovenants, subject to\nnegotiated exceptions on liens, indebtedness, significant corporate changes\n(including mergers), dispositions and\ncertain restrictive agreements.\nAs of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, we had no borrowings\non this\nrevolving credit facility.\nAs of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, there\nwere $9.5 million and $9.6\nmillion of letters of credit, respectively, provided to third parties under the credit facility.\nOn April 17, 2020, we amended the Credit Agreement to, among other\nthings, (i) modify the financial covenant\nfrom being based on total leverage ratio to net leverage ratio, (ii) adjust\nthe pricing grid to reflect the net leverage\nratio calculation, and (iii) increase the maximum maintenance leverage ratio\nthrough March 31, 2021.\n59\n364-Day Credit Agreement\nOn April 17, 2020, we entered into a new $700 million 364-day credit agreement,\nwith JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. and U.S. Bank National Association as joint lead arrangers and joint\nbookrunners.\nThis facility matures on\nApril 16, 2021.\nAs of December 26, 2020, we had no borrowings under this credit\nfacility.\nWe have the ability to\nborrow up to an additional $200 million, from the original facility amount\nof $700 million, under this credit facility\non a revolving basis as needed, subject to the terms and conditions of\nthe credit agreement.\nThe interest rate for\nborrowings under this facility will fluctuate based on our net leverage\nratio.\nAt December 26, 2020, the interest\nrate on this facility was 2.50%.\nThe proceeds from this facility can be used for working capital requirements\nand\ngeneral corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, permitted refinancing\nof existing indebtedness.\nUnder the\nterms of this agreement, we are prohibited from repurchasing our common stock\nuntil we report our financial\nresults for the second quarter of 2021.\nOther Short-Term Credit\nLines\nAs of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, we had various

on an uncommitted basis at fixed rate economic terms to be agreed upon\nat the time of issuance, from\ntime to time through June 23, 2023.\nThe facilities allow us to issue senior promissory notes to the\nlenders at a fixed\nrate based on an agreed upon spread over applicable treasury notes at\nthe time of issuance.\nThe term of each\npossible issuance will be selected by us and can range from five to\n15 years (with an average life no longer than 12\nyears).\nThe proceeds of any issuances under the facilities will be used\nfor general corporate purposes, including\nworking capital and capital expenditures, to refinance existing indebtedness\nand/or to fund potential acquisitions.\nOn June 29, 2018, we amended and restated the above private placement\nfacilities to, among other things, (i) permit\nthe consummation of the Animal Health Spin-off and (ii) provide for the issuance\nof notes in Euros, British Pounds\nand Australian Dollars, in addition to U.S. Dollars.\nThe agreements provide, among other things, that we maintain\ncertain maximum leverage ratios, and contain restrictions relating\nto subsidiary indebtedness, liens, affiliate\ntransactions, disposal of assets and certain changes in ownership.\nThese facilities contain make-whole provisions in\nthe event that we pay off the facilities prior to the applicable due dates.\n60\nOn June 23, 2020, we amended the private placement facilities to, among\nother things, (i) temporarily modify the\nfinancial covenant from being based on total leverage ratio to net leverage\nratio until March 31, 2021, (ii) increase\nthe maximum maintenance leverage ratio through March 31, 2021, but with\na 1.00% interest rate increase on the\noutstanding notes if the net leverage ratio exceeds 3.0x, which will remain\nin effect until we deliver financials for a\nfour-quarter period ending on or after June 30, 2021 showing compliance with\nthe total leverage ratio requirement,\nand (iii) make certain other

placement borrowing at 3.79%, originally due on September 2, 2020,\nwith a similar 10-year borrowing at 2.35% maturing on September 2, 2030.\nU.S. Trade Accounts Receivable Securitization\nWe have a facility agreement with a bank, as agent, based on the securitization of our U.S. trade accounts\nreceivable that is structured as an asset-backed securitization program with pricing\ncommitted for up to three years.\nOur current facility, which has a purchase limit of $350 million, was scheduled to expire on April 29, 2022.\nOn\nJune 22, 2020, the expiration date for this facility was extended to\nJune 12, 2023 and was amended to adjust certain\ncovenant levels for 2020.\nAs of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the borrowings outstanding\nunder this\nsecuritization facility were $0.0 million and $100 million, respectively.\nAt December 26, 2020, the interest rate on\nborrowings under this facility was based on the asset-backed commercial\npaper rate of 0.22% plus 0.95%, for a\ncombined rate of 1.17%.\nAt December 28, 2019, the interest rate on borrowings under this facility\nwas based on\nthe asset-backed commercial paper rate of 1.90% plus 0.75%, for a combined\nrate of 2.65%.\nIf our accounts receivable collection pattern changes due to customers\neither paying late or not making payments,\nour ability to borrow under this facility may be reduced.\nWe are required to pay a commitment fee of 25 to 45 basis points depending upon program utilization.\n61\nLeases\nWe have operating and finance leases for corporate offices, office space, distribution and other facilities, vehicles\nand certain equipment.\nOur leases have remaining terms of less than one year to 16 years, some\nof which may\ninclude options to extend the leases for up to 10 years.\nAs of December 26, 2020, our right-of-use assets related to\noperating leases were $288.8 million and our current and non-current operating\nlease liabilities were $64.7 million\nand $238.7 million, respectively.\nStock Repurchases\nFrom June 21, 2004 through December 26, 2020, we repurchased $3.6\nbillion, or 75,563,289 shares, under our\ncommon stock repurchase programs, with $201.2 million available as of\nDecember 26, 2020 for future common\nstock share repurchases.\nOn October 30, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of\nup to an additional $400 million in\nshares of our common stock.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as previously announced, we have\ntemporarily suspended our share\nrepurchase program in an effort to preserve cash and exercise caution during this\nuncertain period and due to\ncertain restrictions related to financial covenants in our credit facilities.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling interests\nSome minority stockholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right,\nat certain times, to require us to acquire\ntheir ownership interest in those entities at fair value.\nAccount Standards Codification (“ASC”) 480-10 is\napplicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required\nto purchase all or a portion of the\noutstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling interest\nholder under the terms of a put\noption contained in contractual agreements.\nThe components of the change in the Redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests for the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019 and

reductions in the\ncarrying amounts are subject to a floor amount that is equal to\nthe fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests at the time they were originally recorded.\nThe recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests\ncannot go below the floor level.\nThese adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings per\nshare.\nAdditionally, some prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional purchase price cash\nconsideration if certain financial targets are met.\nAny adjustments to these accrual amounts are recorded in our\nconsolidated statement of income.\nFor the years ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019,\nthere were no\n62\nmaterial adjustments recorded in our consolidated statements of income\nrelating to changes in estimated contingent\npurchase price liabilities.\nOn July 1, 2018, we closed on a joint venture with Internet Brands,\na provider of web presence and online\nmarketing software, to create a newly formed entity, Henry Schein One, LLC.\nThe joint venture includes Henry\nSchein Practice Solutions products and services, as well as Henry Schein’s international dental practice\nmanagement systems and the dental businesses of Internet Brands.\nInternet Brands originally held a 26%\nnoncontrolling interest in Henry Schein One, LLC that is accounted\nfor within stockholders’ equity, as well as a\nfreestanding and separately exercisable right to put its noncontrolling\ninterest to Henry Schein, Inc. for fair value\nfollowing the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the formation of the joint venture.\nBeginning with the\nsecond anniversary of the effective date of the formation of the joint venture, Henry\nSchein One began issuing a\nfixed number of additional interests to Internet Brands, which increased\nInternet Brands interest to 27% effective\nJuly 1, 2020.\nHenry Schein One will continue issuing additional interests\nto Internet Brands annually through the\nfifth anniversary, ultimately increasing Internet Brands’ ownership to approximately 33.6%.\nInternet Brands is also\nentitled to receive a fixed number of additional interests, in the aggregate up\nto approximately 1.6% of the joint\nventure’s ownership, if certain operating targets are met by the joint venture in its fourth, fifth and sixth operating\nyears.\nThese additional shares are considered contingent consideration\nthat are accounted for within stockholders’\nequity; however, these shares will not be allocated any net income of Henry Schein One until the\nshares vest or are\nearned by Internet Brands.\nA Monte Carlo simulation was utilized to value the additional contingent\ninterests that\nare subject to operating targets.\nKey assumptions that were applied to derive the fair value of\nthe contingent\ninterests include an assumed equity value of Henry Schein One, LLC\nat its inception date, a risk-free interest rate\nbased on U.S. treasury yields, an assumed future dividend yield, a risk-adjusted\ndiscount rate applied to projected\nfuture cash flows, an assumed equity volatility based on historical stock price\nreturns of a group of guideline\ncompanies, and an estimated correlation of annual cash flow returns to\nequity returns.\nAs a result of this transaction\nwith Internet Brands, we recorded $567.6 million of noncontrolling\ninterest within stockholders’ equity.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests represent our less than 50% ownership interest\nin an acquired subsidiary. Our net income\nis reduced by the portion of the subsidiaries net income that is attributable\nto noncontrolling interests.\nUnrecognized tax benefits\nAs more fully disclosed in Note 14 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements,” we cannot reasonably estimate\nthe timing of future cash flows related to the unrecognized tax benefits,\nincluding accrued interest, of $84.0 million\nas of December 26, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to\nmake estimates and judgments that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and\nrelated disclosures of contingent assets and\nliabilities.\nWe base our estimates on historical data, when available, experience, industry and market trends, and on\nvarious other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,\nthe combined results of\nwhich form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values\nof assets and liabilities that are not readily\napparent from other sources.\nHowever, by their nature, estimates are subject to various assumptions and\nuncertainties.\nReported results are therefore sensitive to any changes in our assumptions,\njudgments and estimates,\nincluding the possibility of obtaining materially different results if different assumptions were\nto be applied.\nOur financial results for the year ended December 26, 2020 were\naffected by certain estimates we made due to the\nadverse business environment brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the year ended December 26, 2020,\nwe recorded incremental bad debt reserves of approximately $10.0\nmillion for our global dental business.\nOur\nstock compensation expense during the year ended December 26, 2020\nwas lower than in the years ended\nDecember 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 due to our estimate that a lower amount\nof performance shares granted\nin 2018, 2019 or 2020 would ultimately vest as a result of the lower-than-normal earnings\nin 2020.\nAdditionally, in\nthe year ended December 26, 2020, we recorded total impairment charges on intangible assets\nof approximately\n$20.3 million.\nAlthough our selling, general and administrative expenses\nfor the year ended December 26, 2020\n63\nrepresent management's best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts, our judgment could\nchange in the future due to the significant uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic\neffect of the COVID-19\npandemic.\nFurthermore, during the year ended December 26, 2020, our gross profit\nmargin was negatively affected by\nsignificant adjustments recorded for PPE inventory and COVID-19 related\nproducts reflecting changes in our\nestimates of net realizable value brought on by volatility of pricing and changes\nin demand experienced during the\nyear. Such conditions may recur and adversely impact gross profit margins in future periods, although we do not\nexpect material inventory adjustments to continue into 2021.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies, which have been discussed with the Audit Committee of\nthe Board of Directors, affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the\npreparation of our financial\nstatements:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from the sale of dental and medical consumable products, equipment (health care distribution\nrevenues), software products and services and other sources (technology\nand value-added services revenues).\nProvisions for discounts, rebates to customers, customer returns and other\ncontra revenue adjustments are included\nin the transaction price at contract inception by estimating the most likely\namount based upon historical data and\nestimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are\nrecognized.\nRevenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized at a point\nin time when control transfers to the\ncustomer.\nSuch sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped\nusing third-party common carriers.\nWe believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating control has transferred to the\ncustomer because we have no post-shipment obligations and this is when\nlegal title and risks and rewards of\nownership transfer to the customer and the point at which we have an\nenforceable right to payment.\nRevenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when control\ntransfers to the customer. This occurs\nwhen the equipment is delivered.\nSuch sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily\nby\nequipment service technicians. Some equipment sales require minimal\ninstallation, which is typically completed at\nthe time of delivery. Our product generally carries standard warranty terms provided by the manufacturer, however,\nin instances where we provide warranty labor services, the warranty\ncosts are accrued in accordance with ASC 460\n“Guarantees”.\nRevenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when\nproducts are shipped to customers or made\navailable electronically. Such software is generally installed by customers and does not require extensive training\ndue to the nature of its design. Revenue derived from post-contract customer\nsupport for software, including annual\nsupport and/or training, is generally recognized over time using time elapsed\nas the input method that best depicts\nthe transfer of control to the customer.\nRevenue derived from other sources, including freight charges, equipment repairs\nand financial services, is\nrecognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when\nthe services are provided.\nWe apply the\npractical expedient to treat shipping and handling activities performed after\nthe customer obtains control as\nfulfillment activities, rather than a separate performance obligation in the contract.\nSales, value-add and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing\nactivities are excluded from\nrevenue.\nCertain of our revenue is derived from bundled arrangements that include\nmultiple distinct performance obligations\nwhich are accounted for separately.\nWhen we sell software products together with related services (i.e.,\ntraining\nand technical support), we allocate revenue to software using the residual\nmethod, using an estimate of the\nstandalone selling price to estimate the fair value of the undelivered\nelements.\nThere are no cases where revenue is\ndeferred due to a lack of a standalone selling price. Bundled arrangements that\ninclude elements that are not\nconsidered software consist primarily of equipment and the related installation\nservice.\nWe allocate revenue for\nsuch arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the goods or services. If\nan observable selling price is not\n64\navailable (i.e., we do not sell the goods or services separately), we use one\nof\nthe following techniques to estimate\nthe standalone selling price:\nadjusted market approach; cost-plus approach; or the residual\nmethod.\nThere is no\nspecific hierarchy for the use of these methods, but the estimated selling\nprice reflects our best estimate of what the\nselling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on\na standalone basis taking into consideration\nthe cost structure of our business, technical skill required, customer\nlocation and other market conditions.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are generally recognized when health care distribution\nand technology and value-added\nservices revenues are recognized.\nIn accordance with the “expected credit loss” model, the carrying amount\nof\naccounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects\nour best estimate of the amounts that will not\nbe collected.\nIn addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, we consider\nmany factors in estimating our\nreserve, including types of customers and their credit worthiness, experience\nand historical data adjusted for current\nconditions and reasonable supportable forecasts.\nSales Returns\nSales returns are recognized as a reduction of revenue by the amount\nof expected returns and are recorded as refund\nliability within current liabilities. We estimate the amount of revenue expected to be reversed to calculate the sales\nreturn liability based on historical data for specific products, adjusted\nas necessary for new products.\nThe\nallowance for returns is presented gross as a refund liability and we\nrecord an inventory asset (and a corresponding\nadjustment to cost of sales) for any products that we expect to be returned.\nInventories and Reserves\nInventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at\nthe lower of cost or market.\nCost is determined by\nthe first-in, first-out method for merchandise or actual cost for large equipment and\nhigh tech equipment.\nIn\naccordance with our policy for inventory valuation, we consider many\nfactors including the condition and salability\nof the inventory, historical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends.\nFrom time to time, we may adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes\nin any of these or other factors expected\nto affect the value of inventory.\nAlthough we believe our judgments, estimates and/or\nassumptions related to\ninventory and reserves are reasonable, making material changes to such\njudgments, estimates and/or assumptions\ncould materially affect our financial results.\nAcquisitions\nWe account for business acquisitions and combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, where the net\nassets of businesses purchased are recorded at their fair value at\nthe acquisition date and our consolidated financial\nstatements include their results of operations from that date.\nAny excess of acquisition consideration over the fair\nvalue of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nThe major classes of assets and liabilities that we\ngenerally allocate purchase price to, excluding goodwill, include identifiable\nintangible assets (i.e., trademarks and\ntrade names, customer relationships and lists, non-compete agreements and\nproduct development), property, plant\nand equipment, deferred taxes and other current and long-term assets and\nliabilities.\nThe estimated fair value of\nidentifiable intangible assets is based on critical estimates, judgments\nand assumptions derived from: analysis of\nmarket conditions; discount rates; discounted cash flows; customer\nretention rates; and estimated useful lives.\nSome prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional\npurchase price cash consideration\nif certain financial targets are met.\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value\nthose\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well\nas contingent consideration, where applicable,\nour estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement.\nAs a result, during the measurement period we\nmay record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with\nthe corresponding offset to goodwill\nwithin our consolidated balance sheets.\nAt the end of the measurement period or final determination\nof the values\nof such assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first,\nany subsequent adjustments are recognized in\nour consolidated statements of operations.\n65\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment analysis at least\nonce annually, or if an event occurs or\ncircumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value\nof a reporting unit below its carrying\nvalue.\nSuch impairment analyses for goodwill require a comparison of the\nfair value to the carrying value of\nreporting units.\nWe regard our reporting units to be our operating segments: global dental, global medical,\nand\ntechnology and value-added services.\nGoodwill was allocated to such reporting units, for the purposes\nof preparing\nour impairment analyses, based on a specific identification basis.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including\nthe identification of reporting units,\nassignment of assets and liabilities that are considered shared services\nto the reporting units, and ultimately the\ndetermination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of\neach reporting unit is calculated by applying\nthe discounted cash flow methodology and confirming with a market approach.\nThis analysis requires judgments,\nincluding estimation of detailed future cash flows based on budget\nexpectations, and determination of comparable\ncompanies to develop a weighted average cost of capital for each reporting\nunit. The estimates used to calculate the\nfair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results,\nmarket conditions, and other\nfactors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination\nof fair value and\ngoodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\nSupplier Rebates\nSupplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized\nover the period they are earned.\nThe\nfactors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted\ninventory purchases and sales in\nconjunction with supplier rebate contract terms which generally provide\nfor increasing rebates based on either\nincreased purchase or sales volume.\nAlthough we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions\nrelated to\nsupplier rebates are reasonable, making material changes to such judgments,\nestimates and/or assumptions could\nmaterially affect our financial results.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, other than goodwill and other definite-lived intangibles,\nare evaluated for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount\nof the assets may not be recoverable through\nthe estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from such\nassets.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements,\ntrademarks, trade names, customer\nrelationships and lists, and product development.\nFor long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses\nare\nonly recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted\nfuture cash flows.\nWe measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the\nestimated fair value.\nWhen an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.\nAlthough we\nbelieve our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions used in estimating\ncash flows and determining fair value are\nreasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or\nassumptions could materially affect such\nimpairment analyses and our financial results.\nDuring the year ended December 26, 2020, we recorded total impairment charges\non intangible assets of\napproximately $20.3 million, nearly all of which was recorded in our\ntechnology and value-added services segment.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted\nto employees and non-\nemployee directors.\nWe measure stock-based compensation at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of\nthe award, and recognize the cost (net of estimated forfeitures) as compensation\nexpense on a straight-line basis\nover the requisite service period.\nOur stock-based compensation expense is reflected in selling, general\nand\nadministrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income.\nStock-based awards are provided to certain employees and non-employee directors\nunder the terms of our 2020\nStock Incentive Plan (formerly known as the 2013 Stock Incentive Plan),\nand our 2015 Non-Employee Director\n66\nStock Incentive Plan (together, the “Plans”).\nThe Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of\nthe\nBoard of Directors.\nEquity-based awards are granted solely in the form of restricted\nstock units, with the exception\nof providing stock options to employees pursuant to certain pre-existing\ncontractual obligations.\nGrants of restricted stock units are stock-based awards granted to recipients with\nspecified vesting provisions.\nIn\nthe case of restricted stock units, common stock is generally delivered\non or following satisfaction of vesting\nconditions.\nWe issue restricted stock units that vest solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time\n(primarily four year cliff vesting, except for grants made under the 2015 Non-Employee\nDirector Stock Incentive\nPlan, which are primarily 12 month cliff vesting) and restricted stock units that vest\nbased on our achieving\nspecified performance measurements and the recipient’s continued service over time (primarily three year cliff\nvesting).\nWith respect to time-based restricted stock units, we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on\nour\nclosing stock price.\nWith respect to performance-based restricted stock units, the number of shares that ultimately\nvest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured\nagainst specified targets over a\nspecified period, as determined by the Compensation Committee of\nthe Board of Directors.\nAlthough there is no\nguarantee that performance targets will be achieved, we estimate the fair value of performance-based\nrestricted\nstock units based on our closing stock price at time of grant.\nThe Plans provide for adjustments to the performance-based restricted\nstock units targets for significant events,\nincluding, without limitation, acquisitions, divestitures, new business ventures,\ncertain capital transactions\n(including share repurchases), restructuring costs, if any, certain litigation settlements or payments, if any, changes\nin tax rates in certain countries, changes in accounting principles or in applicable\nlaws or regulations and foreign\nexchange fluctuations.\nOver the performance period, the number of shares of common\nstock that will ultimately\nvest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward\nor downward based upon our\nestimation of achieving such performance targets.\nThe ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients\nand the\nrelated compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our\nactual performance metrics as defined\nunder the Plans.\nAlthough we believe our judgments, estimates and/or assumptions\nrelated to stock-based compensation are\nreasonable, making material changes to such judgments, estimates and/or\nassumptions could materially affect our\nfinancial results.\nUnrecognized Tax\nBenefits\nASC Topic 740 prescribes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in\naccordance with other provisions contained within this guidance.\nThis topic prescribes a recognition threshold and\na measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement\nof tax positions taken or expected\nto be taken in a tax return.\nFor those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely\nthan not to be\nsustained upon examination by the taxing authorities.\nThe amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of\nbenefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate audit\nsettlement.\nIn the normal course of\nbusiness, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing\nauthorities.\nSuch examinations may result in\nfuture tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities for uncertain\ntax positions taken in respect of certain\ntax matters.\nAccounting Standards Update\nFor a discussion of accounting standards updates that have been adopted\nor will be adopted in the future, please see\nincluded under Item 8.\n67"

    "text": "We are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the U.S.\ndollar and each other, and changes to the credit markets.\nWe attempt to minimize these risks by primarily using\nforeign currency forward contracts and by maintaining counter-party credit limits.\nThese hedging activities provide\nonly limited protection against currency exchange and credit risks.\nFactors that could influence the effectiveness of\nour hedging programs include currency markets and availability of hedging\ninstruments and liquidity of the credit\nmarkets.\nAll foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are components\nof hedging programs and are\nentered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing or anticipated\ncurrency exposure.\nWe do not enter into such\ncontracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by diversifying\nour investments, maintaining a\nstrong balance sheet and having multiple sources of capital.\nForeign Currency Agreements\nThe value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar\nand the value of certain underlying functional\ncurrencies of the Company, including its foreign subsidiaries, may affect our financial results.\nFluctuations in\nexchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues, gross margins, operating expenses\nand retained\nearnings, all of which are expressed in U.S. dollars.\nWhere we deem it prudent, we engage in hedging programs\nusing primarily foreign currency forward contracts aimed at limiting\nthe impact of foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations on earnings.\nWe purchase short-term (i.e., generally 18 months or less) foreign currency forward\ncontracts to protect against currency exchange risks associated with intercompany\nloans due from our international\nsubsidiaries and the payment of merchandise purchases to foreign\nsuppliers.\nWe do not hedge the translation of\nforeign currency profits into U.S. dollars, as we regard this as an accounting\nexposure, not an economic\nexposure.\nA hypothetical 5% change in the average value of the U.S. dollar\nin 2020 compared to foreign currencies\nwould have changed our 2020 reported Net income attributable to Henry\nSchein, Inc. by approximately $1.3\nmillion.\nAs of December 26, 2020, we had forward foreign currency exchange\nagreements, which expire through November\n16, 2023, which include a mark-to-market loss of $9.9 million as determined\nby quoted market prices. Included in\nthe forward foreign currency exchange agreements, Henry Schein, Inc.\nhad EUR/USD forward contracts notionally\ntotaling an amount of approximately €200 million, with a reported fair value\nof these contracts as a net liability of\n$9.6 million.\nA 5% increase in the value of the Euro to the USD from December 26,\n2020, with all other variables\nheld constant, would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these forward contracts\nby decreasing the\nvalue of these instruments by $11.9 million.\nTotal\nReturn Swaps\nOn March 20, 2020, we entered into a total return swap for the purpose\nof economically hedging our unfunded non-\nqualified supplemental retirement plan (“SERP”) and our deferred compensation\nplan (“DCP”).\nThis swap will\noffset changes in our SERP and DCP liabilities.\nAt the inception, the notional value of the investments in these\nplans was $43.4 million.\nAt December 26, 2020, the notional value of the investments\nin these plans was $67.6\nmillion.\nAt December 26, 2020 the financing rate for this swap was\nbased on LIBOR of 0.15% plus 0.38%, for a\ncombined rate of 0.53%.\nFrom March 20, 2020, the effective date of the swap, to December 26, 2020, we have\nrecorded a gain, within the selling, general and administrative line item\nin our consolidated statement of income, of\napproximately $21.2 million, net of transaction costs, related to this undesignated\nswap for the year ended\nDecember 26, 2020.\nThis gain was offset by the change in fair value adjustment in deferred compensation,\nresulting in a neutral impact to our results of operations.\nThis swap is expected to be renewed on an annual basis.\nShort-Term Investments\nWe limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents, short-term investments and derivative instruments, by\nmonitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are\nthe counterparties to such financial\ninstruments.\nAs a risk management policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and utilizing\nnumerous investment grade counterparties.\n68\nVariable\nInterest Rate Debt\nAs of December 26, 2020, we had variable interest rate exposure for certain\nof our revolving credit facilities and\nour U.S. trade accounts receivable securitization.\nOur revolving credit facility which we entered into on April 18, 2017\nand expires on April 18, 2022, has an interest\nrate that is based on the U.S. Dollar LIBOR plus a spread based on our\nleverage ratio at the end of each financial\nreporting quarter.\nAs of December 26, 2020, there was $0.0 million outstanding under\nthis revolving credit\nfacility.\nDuring the year ended December 26, 2020, the average outstanding\nbalance under this revolving credit\nfacility was approximately $21.4 million.\nBased upon our average outstanding balance for this revolving\ncredit\nfacility, for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points, our interest expense thereunder would have increased by\nless than $0.1 million.\nOur U.S trade accounts receivable securitization, which we entered into\non April 17, 2013 and was scheduled to\nexpire on April 29, 2022, has an interest rate that is based upon the asset-backed\ncommercial paper rate.\nOn June\n22, 2020, the expiration date for this facility was extended to June 12, 2023.\nAs of December 26, 2020, the\ncommercial paper rate was 0.22% plus 0.95%, for a combined rate of\n1.17%. At December 26, 2020 the\noutstanding balance was $0.0 million under this securitization facility.\nDuring the year ended December 26, 2020,\nthe average outstanding balance under this securitization facility was approximately\n$92.3 million.\nBased upon our\naverage outstanding balance for this securitization facility, for each hypothetical increase of 25 basis points, our\ninterest expense thereunder would have increased by $0.2 million.\n69"

per share data)\n77\nNote 1 –Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nWe distribute health care products and services primarily to office-based health care practitioners with operations or\naffiliates in the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile,\nChina, the Czech Republic,\nFrance, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, Spain,\nSweden, Switzerland, Thailand,\nUnited Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Henry\nSchein, Inc. and all of our controlled\nsubsidiaries.\nAll intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nInvestments in\nunconsolidated affiliates, which are greater than or equal to 20% and less than or equal\nto 50% owned or\ninvestments in unconsolidated affiliates of less than 20% in which we have the ability\nto influence the operating or\nfinancial decisions, are accounted for under the equity method.\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified\nto conform to the current period presentation.\nWe consolidate a Variable\nInterest Entity (“VIE”) where we hold a variable interest\nand are the primary\nbeneficiary.\nThe VIE is a trade accounts receivable securitization.\nWe are the primary beneficiary because we\nhave the power to direct activities that most significantly affect the economic performance\nand have the obligation\nto absorb the majority of the losses or benefits.\nThe results of operations and financial position of this VIE\nare\nincluded in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor the consolidated VIE, the trade accounts receivable transferred\nto the VIE are pledged as collateral to the\nrelated debt.\nThe creditors have recourse to us for losses on these trade\naccounts receivable.\nAt December 26,\n2020 and December 28, 2019, trade accounts receivable that can only\nbe used to settle obligations of this VIE were\n$\n0.0\nmillion and $\n127\nmillion, respectively, and the liabilities of the VIE where the creditors have recourse to us\nwere $\n0.0\nmillion and $\n100\nmillion, respectively.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United\nStates requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nActual results could differ from those estimates.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) a\npandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global\neconomy, disrupted global supply chains\nand created significant volatility and disruption of global financial markets.\nIn response, many countries\nimplemented business closures and restrictions, stay-at-home and social\ndistancing ordinances and similar measures\nto combat the pandemic, which significantly impacted global business\nand dramatically reduced demand for dental\nproducts and certain medical products in the second quarter of 2020.\nDemand increased in the second half of the\nyear resulting in growth over the prior year driven by sales of personal\nprotective equipment (PPE) and COVID-19\nrelated products.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n78\nOur consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions\nmade by us that affect, among other things,\nour goodwill, long-lived asset and indefinite-lived intangible asset valuation;\ninventory valuation; equity investment\nvaluation; assessment of the annual effective tax rate; valuation of deferred income\ntaxes and income tax\ncontingencies; the allowance for doubtful accounts; hedging activity; vendor\nrebates; measurement of\ncompensation cost for certain share-based performance awards and cash bonus\nplans; and pension plan\nassumptions.\nDue to the significant uncertainty surrounding the future impact\nof COVID-19, our judgments\nregarding estimates and impairments could change in the future.\nIn addition, the impact of COVID-19 had a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows in the\nsecond quarter of 2020. In the\nlatter half of the year, dental and medical practices began to re-open worldwide, and continued to do so\nduring the\nremainder of the year.\nHowever, patient volumes remain below pre-COVID-19 levels and certain regions in the\nU.S. and internationally are experiencing an increase in COVID-19\ncases.\nAs such, there is an ongoing risk that the\nCOVID-19 pandemic may again have a material adverse effect on our business, results\nof operations and cash\nflows and may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition\nand liquidity.\nHowever, the extent of\nthe potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nFiscal Year\nWe report our results of operations and cash flows on a\n52\n-\n53\nweek basis ending on the last Saturday of December.\nThe years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019 and December\n29, 2018 consisted of\n52\nweeks.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods\nor services in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration that we expect to receive for those goods or services.\nTo recognize revenue, we do the following:\n•\nidentify the contract(s) with a customer;\n•\nidentify the performance obligations in the contract;\n•\ndetermine the transaction price;\n•\nallocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract;\nand\n•\nrecognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of dental and medical consumable products, equipment (Health care distribution\nrevenues), software products and services and other sources (Technology and value-added services revenues).\nProvisions for discounts, rebates to customers, customer returns and other\ncontra revenue adjustments are included\nin the transaction price at contract inception by estimating the most likely\namount based upon historical data and\nestimates and are provided for in the period in which the related sales are\nrecognized.\nRevenue derived from the sale of consumable products is recognized at a point\nin time when control transfers to the\ncustomer.\nSuch sales typically entail high-volume, low-dollar orders shipped\nusing third-party common carriers.\nWe believe that the shipment date is the most appropriate point in time indicating control has transferred to the\ncustomer because we have no post-shipment obligations and this is when\nlegal title and risks and rewards of\nownership transfer to the customer and the point at which we have an\nenforceable right to payment.\nRevenue derived from the sale of equipment is recognized when control\ntransfers to the customer.\nThis occurs\nwhen the equipment is delivered.\nSuch sales typically entail scheduled deliveries of large equipment primarily\nby\nequipment service technicians.\nSome equipment sales require minimal installation, which\nis typically completed at\nthe time of delivery.\nOur product generally carries standard warranty terms provided\nby the manufacturer,\nhowever, in instances where we provide warranty labor services, the warranty costs are accrued\nin accordance with\nAccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 460 “Guarantees”.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n79\nRevenue derived from the sale of software products is recognized when products\nare shipped to customers or made\navailable electronically.\nSuch software is generally installed by customers and does\nnot require extensive training\ndue to the nature of its design.\nRevenue derived from post-contract customer support for software,\nincluding annual\nsupport and/or training, is generally recognized over time using time elapsed\nas the input method that best depicts\nthe transfer of control to the customer.\nRevenue derived from other sources, including freight charges, equipment repairs\nand financial services, is\nrecognized when the related product revenue is recognized or when\nthe services are provided.\nWe apply the\npractical expedient to treat shipping and handling activities performed after the\ncustomer obtains control as\nfulfillment activities, rather than a separate performance obligation in the\ncontract.\nSales, value-add and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing\nactivities are excluded from\nrevenue.\nCertain of our revenue is derived from bundled arrangements that include\nmultiple distinct performance obligations,\nwhich are accounted for separately.\nWhen we sell software products together with related services (i.e.,\ntraining\nand technical support), we allocate revenue to software using the residual\nmethod, using an estimate of the\nstandalone selling price to estimate the fair value of the undelivered\nelements.\nThere are no cases where revenue is\ndeferred due to a lack of a standalone selling price.\nBundled arrangements that include elements that are not\nconsidered software consist primarily of equipment and the related\ninstallation service.\nWe allocate revenue for\nsuch arrangements based on the relative selling prices of the goods or services.\nIf an observable selling price is not\navailable (i.e., we do not sell the goods or services separately), we\nuse one of the following techniques to estimate\nthe standalone selling price:\nadjusted market approach; cost-plus approach; or the residual\nmethod.\nThere is no\nspecific hierarchy for the use of these methods, but the estimated selling\nprice reflects our best estimate of what the\nselling prices of each deliverable would be if it were sold regularly on\na standalone basis taking into consideration\nthe cost structure of our business, technical skill required, customer\nlocation and other market conditions.\nSee\nfor additional disclosures of disaggregated net sales and\nfor disclosures of net sales by segment and geographic data.\nContract Balances\nContract balances represent amounts presented in our consolidated balance\nsheet when either we have transferred\ngoods or services to the customer or the customer has paid consideration to us\nunder the contract.\nThese contract\nbalances include accounts receivable, contract assets and contract liabilities.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are generally recognized when health care distribution\nand technology and value-added\nservices revenues are recognized.\nIn accordance with the “expected credit loss” model, the carrying amount\nof\naccounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects\nour best estimate of the amounts that we do\nnot expect to collect.\nIn addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, we consider many\nfactors in\nestimating our reserve, including types of customers and their credit worthiness,\nexperience and historical data\nadjusted for current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts.\nContract Assets\nContract assets include amounts related to any conditional right to consideration\nfor work completed but not billed\nas of the reporting date and generally represent amounts owed to us by\ncustomers, but not yet billed. Contract assets\nare transferred to accounts receivable when the right becomes unconditional.\nThe contract assets primarily relate to\nour bundled arrangements for the sale of equipment and consumables and\nsales of term software licenses.\nCurrent\ncontract assets are included in Prepaid expenses and other and the non-current\ncontract assets are included in\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES

of\nDecember 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 were not material.\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities are comprised of advance payments and upfront payments\nfor service arrangements provided\nover time that are accounted for as deferred revenue amounts.\nContract liabilities are transferred to revenue once\nthe performance obligation has been satisfied.\nCurrent contract liabilities are included in Accrued expenses:\nOther\nand the non-current contract liabilities are included in Other liabilities within\nour consolidated balance sheets.\nAt\nDecember 28, 2019, the current portion of contract liabilities of $\n70.8\nmillion was reported in Accrued expenses:\nOther, and $\n6.2\nmillion related to non-current contract liabilities were reported\nin Other liabilities.\nDuring the year\nended December 26, 2020,\nwe recognized substantially all of the current contract liability amounts\nthat were\npreviously deferred at December 28, 2019.\nAt December 26, 2020, the current and non-current portion of contract\nliabilities were $\n71.5\nmillion and $\n8.2\nmillion, respectively.\nDeferred Commissions\nSales commissions earned by our sales force that relate to long term\narrangements are capitalized as costs to obtain\na contract when the costs incurred are incremental and are expected to be recovered.\nDeferred sales commissions\nare amortized over the estimated customer relationship period.\nWe apply the practical expedient related to the\ncapitalization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract, and recognize such costs as an expense when incurred if\nthe amortization period of the assets that we would have recognized is one year or less.\nOur deferred commission\nbalances as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 were not\nmaterial.\nSales Returns\nSales returns are recognized as a reduction of revenue by the amount\nof expected returns and are recorded as refund\nliability within current liabilities.\nWe estimate the amount of revenue expected to be reversed to calculate the sales\nreturn liability based on historical data for specific products, adjusted\nas necessary for new products.\nThe\nallowance for returns is presented gross as a refund liability and we\nrecord an inventory asset (and a corresponding\nadjustment to cost of sales) for any products that we expect to be returned.\nInventories and Reserves\nInventories consist primarily of finished goods and are valued at\nthe lower of cost or net realizable value.\nCost is\ndetermined by the first-in, first-out method for merchandise or actual cost\nfor large equipment and high tech\nequipment.\nIn accordance with our policy for inventory valuation, we\nconsider many factors including the\ncondition and salability of the inventory, historical sales, forecasted sales and market and economic trends.\nFrom\ntime to time, we adjust our assumptions for anticipated changes in any\nof these or other factors expected to affect\nthe value of inventory.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash\nequivalents.\nDue to the short-term maturity of such investments, the\ncarrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of\nfair value.\nOutstanding checks in excess of funds on deposit of $\n1.3\nmillion and $\n29.5\nmillion, primarily related to\npayments for inventory, were classified as accounts payable as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019.\nDirect Shipping and Handling Costs\nFreight and other direct shipping costs are included in cost of sales.\nDirect handling costs, which represent\nprimarily direct compensation costs of employees who pick, pack and otherwise\nprepare, if necessary, merchandise\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n81\nfor shipment to our customers are reflected in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses.\nDirect

Costs\nWe generally expense advertising and promotional costs as incurred.\nTotal advertising and promotional expenses\nwere $\n30.8\nmillion, $\n25.2\nmillion and $\n12.9\nmillion for the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019\nand December 29, 2018.\nSupplier Rebates\nSupplier rebates are included as a reduction of cost of sales and are recognized\nover the period they are earned.\nThe\nfactors we consider in estimating supplier rebate accruals include forecasted\ninventory purchases and sales, in\nconjunction with supplier rebate contract terms, which generally provide\nfor increasing rebates based on either\nincreased purchase or sales volume.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization.\nDepreciation is\ncomputed primarily under the straight-line method\n(see\nfor estimated useful\nlives).\nAmortization of leasehold improvements is computed using\nthe straight-line method over the lesser of the\nuseful life of the assets or the lease term.\nCapitalized software costs consist of costs to purchase and develop\nsoftware.\nCosts incurred during the application\ndevelopment stage for software bought and further customized by outside suppliers\nfor our use and software\ndeveloped by a supplier for our proprietary use are capitalized.\nCosts incurred for our own personnel who are\ndirectly associated with software development are capitalized.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred income\ntax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events\nthat have been recognized in our\nfinancial statements or tax returns.\nIn estimating future tax consequences, we generally consider all expected\nfuture\nevents other than enactments of changes in tax laws or rates.\nThe effect on deferred income tax assets and\nliabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in\nthe period that includes the enactment date.\nWe file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with our\n80\n% or greater owned U.S. subsidiaries.\nForeign Currency Translation\nand Transactions\nThe financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries\nare determined using local currency as\nthe functional currency.\nAssets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange\nrate in effect at\neach year-end.\nIncome statement accounts are translated at the average rate\nof exchange prevailing during the year.\nTranslation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included\nin\nAccumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity.\nGains and losses resulting from foreign\ncurrency transactions are included in earnings.\nRisk Management and Derivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur\nobjective is to manage the impact that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations\ncould have on recognized asset\nand liability fair values, earnings and cash flows, as well as our net\ninvestments in foreign subsidiaries.\nOur risk\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n82\nmanagement policy requires that derivative contracts used as hedges be\neffective at reducing the risks associated\nwith the exposure being hedged and be designated as a hedge at the inception\nof the contract.\nWe do not enter into\nderivative instruments for speculative purposes.\nOur derivative instruments primarily include foreign currency\nforward agreements related to certain intercompany loans, certain forecasted\ninventory purchase commitments with\nforeign suppliers and foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of our\neuro-denominated foreign\noperations which are designated as net investment hedges.\nForeign currency forward agreements related to forecasted inventory\npurchase commitments with foreign suppliers\nand foreign currency swaps related to foreign currency denominated debt are designated\nas cash flow hedges.\nFor\nderivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the\nchanges in the fair value of the derivative is\nrecorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income\nin stockholders’ equity and subsequently\nreclassified into earnings in the period(s) during which the hedged transaction\naffects earnings.\nWe classify the\ncash flows related to our hedging activities in the same category on our consolidated\nstatements of cash flows as the\ncash flows related to the hedged item.\nForeign currency forward contracts related to our euro-denominated\nforeign operations are designated as net\ninvestment hedges.\nFor derivatives that are designated and qualify as net investment\nhedges, the changes in the fair\nvalue of the derivative is recorded in the foreign currency translation\ngain (loss) component of Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income in stockholders’ equity until the net investment\nis sold or substantially liquidated.\nOur foreign currency forward agreements related to foreign currency\nbalance sheet exposure provide economic\nhedges but are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.\nFor agreements not designated as hedges, changes in the value of the derivative,\nalong with the transaction gain or\nloss on the hedged item, are recorded in earnings.\nTotal return swaps are entered into for the purpose of economically hedging our unfunded non-qualified\nsupplemental retirement plan (“SERP”) and our deferred compensation\nplan (“DCP”).\nThis swap will offset\nchanges in our SERP and DCP liabilities. This swap is expected\nto be renewed on an annual basis.\nAcquisitions\nWe account for business acquisitions and combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, where the net\nassets of businesses purchased are recorded at their fair value at\nthe acquisition date and our consolidated financial\nstatements include their results of operations from that date.\nAny excess of acquisition consideration over the fair\nvalue of identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nThe major classes of assets and liabilities that we\ngenerally allocate purchase price to, excluding goodwill, include identifiable\nintangible assets (i.e., trademarks and\ntrade names, customer relationships and lists, non-compete agreements and\nproduct development), property, plant\nand equipment, deferred taxes and other current and long-term assets and\nliabilities.\nThe estimated fair value of\nidentifiable intangible assets is based on critical estimates, judgments and assumptions\nderived from: analysis of\nmarket conditions; discount rates; discounted cash flows; customer\nretention rates; and estimated useful lives.\nSome prior owners of such acquired subsidiaries are eligible to receive additional\npurchase price cash consideration\nif certain financial targets are met.\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value\nthose\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well\nas contingent consideration, where applicable,\nour estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement.\nAs a result, during the measurement period we\nmay record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with\nthe corresponding offset to goodwill\nwithin our consolidated balance sheets.\nAt the end of the measurement period or final determination\nof the values\nof such assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent\nadjustments are recognized in\nour consolidated statements of operations.\nFor the years\nended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019 and\nDecember 29, 2018, there were no material adjustments recorded in our consolidated\nstatement of income relating\nto changes in subsequent adjustments or estimated contingent purchase price\nliabilities.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n83\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nSome minority stockholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right,\nat certain times, to require us to acquire\ntheir ownership interest in those entities at fair value.\nTheir interests in these subsidiaries are classified outside\npermanent equity on our consolidated balance sheets and are carried\nat the estimated redemption amounts.\nThe\nredemption amounts have been estimated based on expected future earnings\nand cash flow and, if such earnings and\ncash flow are not achieved, the value of the redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests might be impacted.\nChanges in the\nestimated redemption amounts of the noncontrolling interests subject\nto put options are reflected at each reporting\nperiod with a corresponding adjustment to Additional paid-in capital.\nFuture reductions in the carrying amounts are\nsubject to a “floor” amount that is equal to the fair value of the redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests at the time they\nwere originally recorded.\nThe recorded value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests cannot\ngo below the floor\nlevel.\nThese adjustments do not impact the calculation of earnings\nper share.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests represent our less than 50% ownership interest\nin an acquired subsidiary.\nOur net income\nis reduced by the portion of the subsidiaries net income that is attributable\nto noncontrolling interests.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment analysis annually or\nmore frequently if there is a triggering\nevent or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would\nmore likely than not reduce the fair value of a\nreporting unit below its carrying value.\nSuch impairment analyses for goodwill requires a comparison of\nthe fair\nvalue to the carrying value of reporting units.\nWe regard our reporting units to be our operating segments: global\ndental; global medical;\nand technology and value-added services.\nGoodwill was allocated to such reporting units,\nfor the purposes of preparing our impairment analyses, based on a specific\nidentification basis.\nOn December 29, 2019 we adopted Account Standards Update (“ASU”)\n2017-04 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other\n(Topic 350): Simplifying the Test\nfor Goodwill Impairment, which eliminated step two from the goodwill\nimpairment test, thereby eliminating the requirement to calculate the\nimplied fair value of a reporting unit.\nWe\nperform our annual goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of\nour reporting units to the carrying\nvalue of those units.\nGoodwill as of December 26, 2019 and December 29, 2018\nwere tested under the prior\nstandard.\nFor the year ended December 26, 2020 we tested goodwill for impairment,\non the first day of the fourth quarter,\nusing a quantitative analysis comparing the carrying value of our reporting\nunits, including goodwill, to the\nestimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow\nmethodology. If the fair value of a reporting\nunit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered\nnot impaired.\nConversely,\nimpairment loss would be equivalent to the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value limited\nto\nthe total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nFor the years ended December 26, 2019 and December 29, 2018 we tested\ngoodwill for impairment on the first day\nof the fourth quarter, using a quantitative analysis which consisted of a two-step approach.\nThe first step of our\nquantitative analysis consisted of a comparison of the carrying value of\nour reporting units, including goodwill, to\nthe estimated fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash\nflow methodology. If step one resulted in the\ncarrying value of the reporting unit exceeding the fair value of such reporting\nunit, we would have then proceeded\nto step two which would have required us to calculate the amount of impairment\nloss, if any, that we would have\nrecorded for such reporting unit.\nThe calculation of the impairment loss in step two would have been\nequivalent to\nthe reporting unit’s carrying value of goodwill less the implied fair value of such goodwill.\nOur use of a discounted cash flow methodology includes estimates of future\nrevenue based upon budget projections\nand growth rates which take into account estimated inflation rates.\nWe also develop estimates for future levels of\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n84\ngross and operating profits and projected capital expenditures.\nOur methodology also includes the use of estimated\ndiscount rates based upon industry and competitor analysis as well as\nother factors. The estimates that we use in our\ndiscounted cash flow methodology involve many assumptions by\nmanagement that are based upon future growth\nprojections.\nSome factors we consider important that could trigger an interim\nimpairment review include:\nsignificant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected\nfuture operating results; significant\nchanges in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for\nour overall business (e.g., decision to divest a\nbusiness); or significant negative industry or economic trends.\nIf we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill\nis impaired, we record an impairment charge\nin our consolidated statements of income.\nFor the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018,\nthe\nresults of our goodwill impairment analysis did\nno\nt result in any impairments.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, other than goodwill and other definite-lived intangibles,\nare evaluated for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount\nof the assets may not be recoverable through\nthe estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from such\nassets.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of non-compete agreements,\ntrademarks, trade names, customer\nlists, customer relationships and intellectual property.\nFor long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses\nare only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted\nfuture cash flows.\nWe measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and the\nestimated fair value.\nWhen an impairment exists, the related assets are written down to fair value.\nDuring the year ended December 26, 2020, we recorded total impairment\ncharges on intangible assets of\napproximately $\n20.3\nmillion, nearly all of which was recorded in our technology and\nvalue-added services segment.\nCost of Sales\nThe primary components of cost of sales include the cost of the product\n(net of purchase discounts, supplier\nchargebacks and rebates) and inbound and outbound freight charges.\nCosts related to purchasing, receiving,\ninspections, warehousing, internal inventory transfers and other costs of\nour distribution network are included in\nselling, general and administrative expenses along with other operating\ncosts.\nAs a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks\nthroughout our\nindustry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies.\nTotal distribution\nnetwork costs were $\n71.7\nmillion, $\n72.3\nmillion and $\n69.6\nmillion for the years ended December 26, 2020,\nDecember 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income includes certain gains and losses that, under accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the\nUnited States, are excluded from net income as such amounts are recorded\ndirectly as an adjustment to\nstockholders’ equity.\nOur comprehensive income is primarily comprised of net income,\nforeign currency\ntranslation gain (loss), unrealized gain (loss) from foreign currency\nhedging activities, unrealized investment gain\n(loss) and pension adjustment gain (loss).\nLeases\nOn December 30, 2018, we adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases, using a modified retrospective approach, whereby\nwe continue to apply existing lease guidance during the comparative\nperiods and apply the new lease\nrequirements through a cumulative-effect adjustment in the period of adoption. We elected the package of\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n85\npractical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within\nthe new standard, which, among other things,\nallowed us to carry forward the historical lease classification. Information\nrelated to leases as of December 28,\n2019 is presented under Topic 842, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported under\nlegacy guidance in ASC Topic 840, Leases.\nThe most significant impact was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities\nfor operating leases, while our\naccounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged. Adoption\nof the new standard resulted in the\nrecording of additional net operating lease assets of $\n259.9\nmillion and operating lease liabilities of $\n267.3\nmillion,\nand a decrease of $\n1.1\nmillion and $\n8.5\nmillion in prepaid rent and deferred rent liabilities, respectively. The\nstandard did not materially impact our consolidated net income and had\nno impact on cash flows.\nWe determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception.\nAn arrangement contains a lease if it implicitly or\nexplicitly identifies an asset to be used and conveys the right to control\nthe use of the identified asset in exchange\nfor consideration.\nAs a lessee, we include operating leases in Operating lease right-of-use\n(“ROU”) assets,\nOperating lease liabilities, and Non-current operating lease liabilities in our\nconsolidated balance sheet.\nFinance\nleases are included in Property and equipment, Current maturities of\nlong-term debt, and Long-term debt in our\nconsolidated balance\nsheet.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease\nterm and lease liabilities represent our\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.\nOperating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized\nupon commencement of the lease based on the present value of the lease payments\nover the lease term.\nAs most of\nour leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we generally use our incremental\nborrowing rate based on the\nestimated rate of interest for fully collateralized and fully amortizing borrowings\nover a similar term of the lease\npayments at commencement date to determine the present value of\nlease payments.\nWhen readily determinable, we\nuse the implicit rate.\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably\ncertain that we will exercise that option.\nLease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis\nover the lease term.\nExpenses associated with operating leases and finance leases\nare included in “Selling, general\nand administrative” and “Interest expense”, respectively within our Consolidated\nStatement of Income.\nLeases\nwith a lease term of 12 months or less are not capitalized.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for as a single\nlease component, except non-lease components for leases of vehicles, which\nare accounted for separately.\nWhen a\nvehicle lease contains both lease and non-lease components, we allocate\nthe transaction price based on the relative\nstandalone selling price.\nAccounting Pronouncements Adopted\nOn December 29, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles-Goodwill\nand Other” (Topic 350) (“ASU\n2017-04”).\nASU 2017-04 eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment\ntest, thereby eliminating the\nrequirement to calculate the implied fair value of a reporting unit.\nASU 2017-04 requires us to perform our annual\ngoodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of our reporting\nunits to the carrying value of those units.\nIf\nthe carrying value exceeds the fair value, we will be required to recognize\nan impairment charge;

Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or\npaid to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe hierarchy for determining that distinguishes\nbetween (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained\nfrom independent sources\n(observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based\non\nthe best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs).\nThe fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the\nhighest priority to unadjusted quoted prices\nin active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority\nto unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:\n•\nLevel 1— Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets\nor liabilities that are accessible at the\nmeasurement date.\n•\nLevel 2— Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable\nfor the asset or liability,\neither directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;\nquoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets\nthat are not active; inputs other than quoted\nprices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are\nderived principally from or corroborated by\nobservable market data by correlation or other means.\n•\nLevel 3— Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability.\nThe following section describes the fair values of our financial instruments\nand the methodologies that we used to\nmeasure their fair values.\nInvestments and notes receivable\nThere are no quoted market prices available for investments in unconsolidated\naffiliates and notes receivable;\nhowever, we believe the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the interest rates\nin the\napplicable markets.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n102\nDebt\nThe fair value of our debt (including bank credit lines) is classified as\nLevel 3 within the fair value hierarchy and as\nof December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 was estimated at $\n699.0\nmillion and $\n756.7\nmillion, respectively.\nFactors that we considered when estimating the fair value of our debt\ninclude market conditions, such as interest\nrates and credit spreads.\nDerivative contracts\nDerivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices and\nsignificant other observable and unobservable\ninputs.\nWe use derivative instruments to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange\nrates.\nOur derivative instruments primarily include foreign currency forward\nagreements related to certain\nintercompany loans, certain forecasted inventory purchase commitments with\nforeign suppliers and foreign\ncurrency forward contracts to hedge a portion of our euro-denominated\nforeign operations which are designated as\nnet investment hedges;\nand a total return swap for the purpose of economically hedging\nour unfunded non-qualified\nSERP and our DCP.\nThe fair values for the majority of our foreign currency derivative contracts\nare obtained by comparing our contract\nrate to a published forward price of the underlying market rates, which\nis based on market rates for comparable\ntransactions and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nSee\nfor additional information.\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests\nThe values for Redeemable noncontrolling interests are classified within\nLevel 3 of

The positive effect of the APA and the other audit resolutions are not expected to be recurring and,\nas a result, we expect our effective tax rate in future periods to be higher.\nIn 2019, our effective tax rate of\n23.4\n% was primarily impacted by state and foreign income taxes and interest\nexpense.\nIn 2018, our effective tax rate of\n20.0\n% was primarily impacted by a reduction in the estimate of our\ntransition tax associated with the Tax Act, tax charges and credits associated with legal entity reorganizations\noutside the U.S., and state and foreign income taxes and interest expense.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act\n(“CARES Act”) was enacted in\nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe CARES Act includes, but is not limited to, certain income tax\nprovisions that modify the Section 163(j) limitation of business interest and Net\nOperating Loss (“NOL”) carryover\nand carryback rules.\nThe modifications to Section 163(j) increase the allowable business\ninterest deduction from\n30\n% of adjusted taxable income to\n50\n% of adjusted taxable income for years beginning in 2019 and 2020.\nThe\nCARES Act eliminated the NOL income limitation for years beginning\nbefore 2021 and it extended the carryback\nperiod to five years for losses incurred in 2018, 2019 and 2020.\nWe have analyzed the income tax provisions of the\nCARES Act and have accounted for the impact in the year ended December 26,\n2020, which did not have a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThere are certain other non-income tax benefits available\nto us under the CARES Act that require further clarification or interpretation\nthat may affect our consolidated\nfinancial statements in the future.\nOn December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act was\nenacted into\nlaw and extended certain non-income tax benefits under the CARES\nAct.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n109\nOn July 20, 2020, the IRS issued final regulations related to the Tax Act.\nThe final regulations concern the global\nintangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) and subpart F income provisions of the Tax Act.\nTo provide flexibility to\ntaxpayers, the IRS is permitting the application of these final regulations to\nprior tax years, if the taxpayer elects to\ndo so.\nWe have analyzed the final regulations, which do not have a material impact to our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government passed the Tax Act.\nThe Tax Act is comprehensive tax legislation\nthat implemented complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not\nlimited to, the reduction of the corporate\ntax rate from\n35\n% to\n21\n%, modification of accelerated depreciation, the repeal of the domestic\nmanufacturing\ndeduction and changes to the limitations of the deductibility of interest.\nAdditionally, the Tax\nAct moved from a\nglobal tax regime to a modified territorial regime, which requires U.S. companies\nto pay a mandatory one-time\ntransition tax on historical offshore earnings that have not been repatriated to the U.S.\nThe transition tax is payable\nover eight years.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded provisional amounts\nfor any items that could be\nreasonably estimated at the time.\nThis included the one-time transition tax that we estimated to\nbe $\n140.0\nmillion\nand a net deferred tax expense of $\n3.0\nmillion attributable to the revaluation of deferred taxes due to the lower\nenacted federal income tax rate of 21%.\nWe completed our analysis in the year ended December 29, 2018 and\nrecorded a net $\n10.0\nmillion reduction to the one-time transition tax and an additional $\n1.7\nmillion net deferred tax\nbenefit from the revaluation of deferred\ntaxes to reflect the new tax rate.\nWithin our consolidated balance sheets, transition tax of $\n9.9\nmillion was included in “Accrued taxes” for 2020 and\n2019 and $\n74.5\nmillion and $\n94.9\nmillion were included in “Other liabilities” for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe FASB Staff Q&A, Topic\n740 No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity\ncan make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred\ntaxes for temporary differences expected to\nreverse as GILTI in future years or provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred.\nWe\nelected to recognize the tax on GILTI as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred.\nWe recorded a current\ntax expense for the GILTI provision of $\n2.4\nmillion $\n3.9\nmillion and $\n7.6\nmillion for 2020, 2019, and 2018,\nrespectively.\nDue to the one-time transition tax and the imposition of the GILTI provisions, all previously unremitted earnings\nwill no longer be subject to U.S. federal income tax; however, there could be U.S. state and/or foreign withholding\ntaxes upon distribution of such unremitted earnings.\nDetermination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax\nliability with respect to such earnings is not practicable.\nASC 740 prescribes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized\nin the financial statements in\naccordance with other provisions contained within this guidance.\nThis topic prescribes a recognition threshold and\na measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement\nof tax positions taken or expected\nto be taken in a tax return.\nFor those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely\nthan not to be\nsustained upon examination by the taxing authorities.\nThe amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of\nbenefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate audit\nsettlement.\nIn the normal course of\nbusiness, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing\nauthorities.\nSuch examinations may result in\nfuture tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities for uncertain\ntax positions taken in respect to certain\ntax matters.\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, which are included in “Other\nliabilities” within our consolidated\nbalance sheets as of December 26, 2020 was approximately $\n84.0\nmillion, of which $\n70.1\nmillion would affect the\neffective tax rate if recognized.\nIt is possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits\nmay change in the next\n12 months, which may result in a material impact on our consolidated statement of\nincome.\nThe tax years subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions include\nthe years 2012 and forward by the IRS, as\nwell as the years 2008 and forward for certain states and certain foreign\njurisdictions.\nAll tax returns audited by the\nIRS are officially closed through 2011 and 2014 through 2016.\nAll IRS audit fieldwork has been completed for the\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n110\nyears 2012 and 2013.\nIn the quarter ended December 28, 2019, we reached a settlement with\nthe U.S. Competent\nAuthority to resolve certain transfer pricing issues related to 2012 and 2013.\nFor all remaining outstanding issues\nfor 2012 and 2013, we have provided all necessary documentation to\nthe Appellate Division to date and are waiting\nfor responses.\nWe do not believe the final resolution will have a material impact to our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nDuring the quarter ended September 26, 2020 we finalized negotiations\nwith the Advance Pricing\nDivision and reached an agreement on an appropriate transfer pricing\nmethodology for the years 2014-2025.\nThe\nobjective of this resolution is to mitigate future transfer pricing audit\nadjustments.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we\nreached a favorable resolution with the IRS relating to select audit years.\nThe total amounts of interest and penalties are classified as a component of\nthe provision for income taxes.\nThe\namount of tax interest expense (credit) was approximately $(\n3.3\n) million, $\n2.2\nmillion, and $\n3.6\nmillion in 2020,\n2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe total amount of accrued interest is included in “Other liabilities”, and was\napproximately $\n14.0\nmillion as of December 26, 2020 and $\n18.0\nmillion as of December 28, 2019.\nNo\npenalties\nwere accrued for the periods presented.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits:\nDecember 26,\nDecember 28,\nDecember 29,\n2020\n2019\n2018\nBalance, beginning of period\n$\n91,100\n$\n77,800\n$\n83,200\nAdditions based on current year tax positions\n4,900\n4,900\n5,000\nAdditions based on prior year tax positions\n7,900\n17,300\n9,400\nReductions based on prior year tax positions\n(\n1,000\n)\n(\n1,000\n)\n(\n1,600\n)\nReductions resulting from settlements with taxing authorities\n(\n18,600\n)\n(\n4,200\n)\n(\n1,600\n)\nReductions resulting from lapse in statutes of limitations\n(\n14,300\n)\n(\n3,700\n)\n(\n16,600\n)\nBalance, end of period\n$\n70,000\n$\n91,100\n$\n77,800\nNote 15 – Concentrations of Risk\nCertain financial instruments potentially subject us to concentrations of credit\nrisk.\nThese financial instruments\nconsist primarily of cash equivalents, trade receivables, long-term investments,\nnotes receivable and derivative\ninstruments.\nIn all cases, our maximum exposure to loss from credit\nrisk equals the gross fair value of the financial\ninstruments.\nWe routinely maintain cash balances at financial institutions in excess of insured amounts. We have\nnot experienced any loss in such accounts and we manage this risk through\nmaintaining cash deposits and other\nhighly liquid investments in high quality financial institutions.\nWe continuously assess the need for reserves for\nsuch losses, which have been within our expectations.\nWe do not require collateral or other security to support\nfinancial instruments subject to credit risk, except for long-term notes receivable.\nWe limit our credit risk with respect to our cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and derivative\ninstruments, by monitoring the credit worthiness of the financial institutions who are\nthe counter-parties to such\nfinancial instruments.\nAs a risk management policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure by diversifying and\nutilizing numerous investment grade counter-parties.\nWith respect to our trade receivables, our credit risk is somewhat limited due to a relatively large customer base\nand\nits dispersion across different types of health care professionals and geographic areas.\nFor the year ended\nDecember 26, 2020, two customers accounted for slightly more than\n3\n% of our net sales from continuing\noperations.\nFor the year ended December 28, 2019, one customer accounted\nfor slightly less than\n2\n% of our net\nsales from continuing operations.\nWith respect to our sources of supply, our top 10 health care distribution\nsuppliers from continuing operations and our single largest supplier from continuing\noperations accounted for\napproximately\n30\n% and\n4\n%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases in 2020 and approximately\n31\n% and\n6\n%,\nrespectively, of our aggregate purchases in 2019.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n111\nOur long-term notes receivable primarily represent strategic financing arrangements\nwith certain industry affiliates\nand amounts owed to us from sales of certain businesses.\nGenerally, these notes are secured by certain assets of the\ncounterparty; however, in most cases our security is subordinate to other commercial financial institutions.\nWhile\nwe have exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by these counter-parties,\nwe conduct ongoing\nassessments of their financial and operational performance.\nNote 16 – Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nWe are exposed to market risks as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the U.S.\ndollar and each other, and changes to the credit risk of the derivative counterparties.\nWe attempt to minimize these\nrisks by primarily using foreign currency forward contracts and by\nmaintaining counter-party credit limits.\nThese\nhedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange\nand credit risks.\nFactors that could\ninfluence the effectiveness of our hedging programs include currency markets and\navailability of hedging\ninstruments and liquidity of the credit markets.\nAll foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into are\ncomponents of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose\nof hedging an existing or anticipated\ncurrency exposure.\nWe do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes and we manage our credit risks by\ndiversifying our counterparties, maintaining a strong balance sheet and having\nmultiple sources of capital.\nDuring 2019 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of our euro-denominated\nforeign operations which are designated as net investment hedges.\nThese net investment hedges offset the change\nin the U.S dollar value of our investment in certain euro-functional currency subsidiaries due to fluctuating foreign\nexchange rates.\nGains and losses related to these net investment hedges are recorded\nin\nAccumulated other\ncomprehensive loss\nwithin our consolidated balance sheets.\nAmounts excluded from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness are included in interest expense within our consolidated statements\nof income.\nThe aggregate\nnotional value of this net investment hedge, which matures on\nNovember 16, 2023\n, is approximately €\n200\nmillion.\nDuring the years ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 we\nrecognized approximately $\n4.7\nmillion and\n$\n0.6\nmillion, respectively, of interest savings as a result of this net investment hedge.\nOn\nMarch 20, 2020\n,\nwe entered into a total return swap for the purpose of economically hedging our unfunded non-\nqualified SERP and DCP.  This swap will offset changes in our SERP and DCP liabilities.\nAt the inception, the\nnotional value of the investments in these plans was $\n43.4\nmillion.\nAt December 26, 2020, the notional value of\nthe investments in these plans was $\n67.6\nmillion.\nAt December 26, 2020, the financing rate for this swap is based\non LIBOR of\n0.15\n% plus\n0.38\n%, for a combined rate of\n0.53\n%.\nFrom March 20, 2020, the effective date of the\nswap, to December 26, 2020, we have recorded a gain, within the selling,\ngeneral and administrative line item in\nour consolidated statement of income, of approximately $\n21.2\nmillion, net of transaction costs, related to this\nundesignated swap for the year ended December 26, 2020.\nThis gain was partially offset by the change in fair\nvalue adjustment of $\n10.6\nmillion in the SERP and the DCP, which occurred prior to the inception of the swap on\nMarch 20, 2020.\nThis swap is expected to be renewed on an annual basis and\nis expected to result in a neutral\nimpact to our results of operations.\nSee\nfor additional information.\nFluctuations in the value of certain foreign currencies as compared\nto the U.S. dollar may positively or negatively\naffect our revenues, gross margins, operating expenses and retained earnings, all of which are expressed\nin U.S.\ndollars.\nWhere we deem it prudent, we engage in hedging programs using primarily\nforeign currency forward\ncontracts aimed at limiting the impact of foreign currency exchange\nrate fluctuations on earnings.\nWe purchase\nshort-term (i.e., generally\n18 months\nor less) foreign currency forward contracts to protect against\ncurrency\nexchange risks associated with intercompany loans due from our international\nsubsidiaries and the payment of\nmerchandise purchases to our foreign suppliers.\nWe do not hedge the translation of foreign currency profits into\nU.S. dollars, as we regard this as an accounting exposure, not an\neconomic exposure.\nOur hedging activities have\nhistorically not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAccordingly, additional disclosures\nrelated to derivatives and hedging activities required by ASC 815 have\nbeen omitted.\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n112\nNote 17 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nRevenue

($\n34.4\nmillion after-tax) and $\n32.6\nmillion ($\n25.3\nmillion after-tax) for the years ended December 28, 2019\nand December 29, 2018.\nOur accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows present our\nstock-based compensation expense as an\nadjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating\nactivities for all periods presented.\nIn the\naccompanying consolidated statements of cash flows, there were\nno\nbenefits associated with tax deductions in\nexcess of recognized compensation as a cash inflow from financing\nactivities for the years ended December 26,\n2020, December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018.\nStock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted\nto employees and non-\nemployee directors.\nWe measure stock-based compensation at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of\nthe award, and recognize the cost (net of estimated forfeitures) as compensation\nexpense on a straight-line basis\nover the requisite service period.\nOur stock-based compensation expense is reflected in selling, general\nand\nadministrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income.\nStock-based awards are provided to certain employees and non-employee directors\nunder the terms of our 2020\nStock Incentive Plan (formerly known as the 2013 Stock Incentive Plan),\nand our 2015 Non-Employee Director\nStock Incentive Plan (together, the “Plans”).\nThe Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of\nthe\nBoard of Directors.\nEquity-based awards are granted solely in the form of restricted\nstock units, with the exception\nof providing stock options to employees pursuant to certain pre-existing\ncontractual obligations.\nAs of December\n26, 2020, there were\n65,243\nshares

Stock Incentive Plan.\nGrants of restricted stock units are stock-based awards granted to recipients with\nspecified vesting provisions.\nIn\nthe case of restricted stock units, common stock is generally delivered\non or following satisfaction of vesting\nconditions.\nWe issue restricted stock units that vest solely based on the recipient’s continued service over time\n(primarily four year cliff vesting, except for grants made under the 2015 Non-Employee\nDirector Stock Incentive\nPlan, which are primarily\n12 month\ncliff vesting) and restricted stock units that vest based on our

STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n116\nWith respect to time-based restricted stock units, we estimate the fair value on the date of grant based on\nour\nclosing stock price.\nWith respect to performance-based restricted stock units, the number of shares that ultimately\nvest and are received by the recipient is based upon our performance as measured\nagainst specified targets over a\nspecified period, as determined by the Compensation Committee of\nthe Board of Directors.\nAlthough there is no\nguarantee that performance targets will be achieved, we estimate the fair value of\nperformance-based restricted\nstock units based on our closing stock price at time of grant.\nThe Plans provide for adjustments to the performance-based restricted\nstock units targets for significant events,\nincluding, without limitation, acquisitions, divestitures, new business ventures,\ncertain capital transactions\n(including share repurchases), restructuring costs, if any, certain litigation settlements or payments, if any, changes\nin tax rates in certain countries, changes in accounting principles or\nin applicable laws or regulations and foreign\nexchange fluctuations.\nOver the performance period, the number of shares of common\nstock that will ultimately\nvest and be issued and the related compensation expense is adjusted upward\nor downward based upon our\nestimation of achieving such performance targets.\nThe ultimate number of shares delivered to recipients\nand the\nrelated compensation cost recognized as an expense will be based on our\nactual performance metrics as defined\nunder the Plans.\nAs a result of the Separation, the number of our unvested (as of the\ndate of the Separation) equity-based awards\nfrom previous grants made under our Long-term Incentive Program under the\nPlans was increased by a factor of\napproximately\n1.2633\n, along with a corresponding\ndecrease\nin our price per share.\nWe record deferred income tax assets for awards that will result in future deductions on our income tax returns\nbased on the amount of compensation cost recognized and our statutory tax\nrate in the jurisdiction in which we will\nreceive a deduction.\nStock-based compensation grants for the three years ended December 26,\n2020 consisted of restricted stock/unit\ngrants.\nCertain stock-based compensation granted may require us\nto settle in the form of a cash payment.\nDuring\nthe year ended December 26, 2020, we recorded a liability of $\n0.8\nmillion relating to the grant date fair value of\nstock-based compensation to be settled in cash.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of stock-based awards\ngranted before forfeitures was $\n60.23\n, $\n56.83\nand $\n71.38\nper share during the years

Derivative Litigation, No. 1:19-cv-06485-LDH-JO, and appointed the\ntwo law firms that filed\nthe Finazzo case as co-lead counsel for the consolidated action.\nThe parties agreed to a resolution of this matter\nsubject to various conditions, including court approval.\nThe settlement involves the adoption of certain procedures\nbut does not involve the payment of any money except a fee to the\nplaintiffs’ attorneys that is immaterial.\nAfter the\ncourt referred the motion to approve the settlement to a Magistrate Judge,\nthe parties consented to having the case\nassigned to the Magistrate Judge for all purposes.\nThe Magistrate Judge to which the matter was ultimately\nassigned held a fairness hearing and issued an order and judgment approving\nthe settlement.\nThe order and\njudgment approving the settlement have become final.\nOn February 5, 2021, Jack Garnsey filed a putative shareholder derivative\naction on behalf of Covetrus, Inc. in the\nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, naming as defendants Benjamin Shaw, Christine T.\nKomola, Steven Paladino, Betsy Atkins, Deborah G. Ellinger, Sandra L. Helton, Philip A. Laskaway, Mark J.\nManoff, Edward M. McNamara, Ravi Sachdev, David E. Shaw, Benjamin Wolin,\nand Henry Schein, Inc., with\nCovetrus, Inc. named as a nominal defendant.\nThe complaint alleges that the individual defendants breached\ntheir\nfiduciary duties under state law in connection with the same allegations\nasserted in the City of Hollywood securities\nclass action described above and further alleges that Henry Schein aided\nand abetted such breaches. The complaint\nalso asserts claims for contribution under the federal securities laws against\nHenry Schein and other defendants,\nalso arising out of the allegations in the City of Hollywood lawsuit.\nThe complaint seeks declaratory, injunctive,\nand monetary relief. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously against this action.\nFrom time to time, we may become a party to other legal proceedings,\nincluding, without limitation, product\nliability claims, employment matters, commercial disputes, governmental\ninquiries and investigations (which may\nHENRY SCHEIN, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n122\nin some cases involve our\nentering into settlement arrangements or consent decrees), and other\nmatters arising out\nof the ordinary course of our business.\nWhile the results of any legal proceeding cannot be predicted with certainty,\nin our opinion none of these other pending matters are currently anticipated\nto have a material adverse effect on our\nconsolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nAs of December 26, 2020, we had accrued our best estimate of potential losses relating to claims that were probable\nto result in liability and for which we were able to reasonably estimate a loss.  This accrued amount, as well as\nrelated expenses, was not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Our method for\ndetermining estimated losses considers currently available facts, presently enacted laws and regulations and other\nfactors, including probable recoveries from third parties.\nNote 21

    "text": "Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including\nour principal executive officer and\nprincipal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report as\nsuch term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and\n15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on\nthis evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer,\nconcluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 26,\n2020 to ensure that all\nmaterial information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file\nor submit under the Exchange Act is\naccumulated and communicated to them as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure and\nthat all such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported\nwithin the time periods specified in the\nSEC’s rules and forms.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe combination of acquisitions and continued acquisition integrations undertaken\nduring the quarter and carried\nover from prior quarters as well as changes to the operating methods of some\nof our internal controls over financial\nreporting due to the COVID-19 pandemic, when considered in the aggregate,\nrepresents a material change in our\ninternal control over financial reporting.\nDuring the quarter ended December 26, 2020,\nwe completed the acquisition of a dental business in North America\nwith approximate aggregate annual revenues of approximately $20\nmillion.\nIn addition, post-acquisition integration\nrelated activities continued for our global dental and North American\nmedical businesses acquired during prior\nquarters, representing aggregate annual revenues of approximately $370 million.\nThese acquisitions, the majority\nof which utilize separate information and financial accounting systems, have\nbeen included in our consolidated\nfinancial statements since their respective dates of acquisition.\nAll acquisitions and continued acquisition integrations involve necessary\nand appropriate change-management\ncontrols that are considered in our annual assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of\nour internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nIn addition, as a result of a combination of continued governmental imposed\nand Company directed closures of\nsome of our facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had\nto maintain a number of changes to the\noperating methods of some of our internal controls. For example, moving\nfrom manual sign-offs and in-person\nmeetings to electronic sign-offs and electronic communications such as email and\ntelephonic or video conference\ndue to out-of-office working arrangements. However, the design of our internal control framework and objectives\nover financial reporting remains unchanged and we do not believe that\nthese changes have materially affected, or\nare reasonably likely to materially affect, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate\ninternal control over financial reporting,\nas such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).\nOur internal control system is designed to provide\nreasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the\npreparation and fair presentation of\npublished financial statements.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including our\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting based on the\nframework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013),\nupdated and reissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations, or the COSO\nFramework. Based on our\n125\nevaluation under the COSO Framework, our management concluded that our\ninternal control over financial\nreporting was effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 26, 2020.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 26,\n2020 has been independently\naudited by BDO USA, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, and their attestation is included\nherein.\nLimitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control\nA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide\nonly reasonable, not absolute, assurance\nthat the objectives of the internal control system are met. Because of\nthe inherent limitations of any internal control\nsystem, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that\nall control issues, if any, within a company\nhave been detected.\n126\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nStockholders and Board of Directors\nHenry Schein, Inc.\nMelville, NY\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe\nhave audited Henry\nSchein, Inc.’s\n(the “Company’s”)\ninternal control over\nfinancial reporting as\nof December\n26, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee\nof\nSponsoring\nOrganizations\nof\nthe\nTreadway\nCommission\n(the\n“COSO\ncriteria”).\nIn\nour\nopinion,\nthe\nCompany\nmaintained,\nin\nall\nmaterial\nrespects,\neffective\ninternal\ncontrol\nover\nfinancial\nreporting\nas\nof\nDecember\n26,\n2020,\nbased on the COSO criteria.\nWe\nalso\nhave\naudited,\nin\naccordance\nwith\nthe\nstandards\nof\nthe\nPublic\nCompany\nAccounting\nOversight\nBoard\n(United\nStates)\n(“PCAOB”),\nthe\nconsolidated\nbalance\nsheets\nof\nthe\nCompany\nas\nof\nDecember\n26,\n2020\nand\nDecember\n28,\n2019, the\nrelated\nconsolidated statements\nof\nincome, comprehensive\nincome,\nstockholders’ equity,\nand\ncash\nflows\nfor\neach\nof\nthe\nthree\nyears\nin\nthe\nperiod\nended\nDecember\n26,\n2020,\nand\nthe\nrelated\nnotes\nand\nschedule and our report dated February 17, 2021 expressed an unqualified\nopinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s\nmanagement is\nresponsible for\nmaintaining effective\ninternal control\nover financial\nreporting and\nfor\nits\nassessment\nof\nthe\neffectiveness\nof\ninternal\ncontrol\nover\nfinancial\nreporting,\nincluded\nin\nthe\naccompanying\n“Item 9A, Management’s\nReport on Internal\nControl over Financial Reporting”.
