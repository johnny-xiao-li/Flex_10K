    "text": "General\nMartin Marietta Materials, Inc. (the Company or Martin Marietta) is a natural resource-based building materials company.  The Company supplies aggregates (crushed stone, sand and gravel) through its network of approximately 300 quarries, mines and distribution yards in 27 states, Canada and The Bahamas.  In 2020, the aggregates product gross profit accounted for 68% of the Company’s consolidated total product gross profit.  In the western United States, Martin Marietta also provides cement and downstream products, namely, ready mixed concrete, asphalt and paving services, in markets that are naturally vertically integrated and where the Company has a leading aggregates position.  Specifically, the Company has two cement plants in Texas, and ready mixed concrete and asphalt operations in Texas, Colorado and Wyoming.  Asphalt operations and paving services are exclusively in Colorado.  The Company’s heavy-side building materials are used in infrastructure, nonresidential and residential construction projects.  Aggregates are also used in agricultural, utility and environmental applications and as railroad ballast.  The aggregates, cement, ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are reported collectively as the “Building Materials Business”.  The Company also operates a Magnesia Specialties business with production facilities in Michigan and Ohio.  The Magnesia Specialties business produces magnesia-based chemical products that are used in industrial, agricultural and environmental applications.  It also produces dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers for steel production and land stabilization.  Magnesia Specialties’ products are shipped to customers domestically and worldwide.\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS PRIOR TO 2020, SEE THE INFORMATION APPEARING UNDER THE HEADING “GENERAL” INCLUDED IN\nOF THE COMPANY’S\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WHICH INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.\nBusiness Segment Information\nThe Company conducts its Building Materials Business through two reportable segments, organized by geography: East Group and West Group. The East Group provides aggregates products only. The West Group provides aggregates, cement and downstream products. The top ten states accounted for 87% of the Building Materials Business total revenues in 2020: Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, Iowa, Florida, South Carolina, Indiana, Maryland and Nebraska. The Company’s Magnesia Specialties is reported as a separate segment, which includes its magnesia-based chemicals and dolomitic lime businesses.  For more information on the organization and geographic area of the Company’s business segments,\nsee “\n” and “\n” of the “Notes to Financial Statements” of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which appear in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Form 10-K).\nBuilding Materials Business\nThe profitability of the Building Materials Business, which serves customers in the construction marketplace, is sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and cyclical swings in construction spending, which are in turn affected by fluctuations in levels of public-sector infrastructure funding; interest rates; access to capital markets; and demographic, geographic, employment and population dynamics. The heavy-side construction business, inclusive of much of the Company’s operations, is conducted outdoors. Therefore, erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes, and other weather-related conditions, including precipitation, flooding, hurricanes, snowstorms, extreme temperatures and droughts, can significantly affect production schedules, shipments, costs, efficiencies and profitability.  Generally, the financial results for the first and fourth quarters are subject to the impacts of winter weather, while the second and third quarters are subject to the impacts of heavy precipitation.\nAggregates are an engineered, granular material consisting of crushed stone, sand and gravel, which is manufactured to specific sizes, grades and chemistry for use primarily in construction applications.  The Company’s operations consist primarily of open pit quarries; however, the Company is the largest operator of underground aggregates mines in the United States with 14 active underground mines located in the East Group.\nCement is the basic agent used to bind aggregates, sand and water in the production of ready mixed concrete.  The Company has a strategic and leading cement position in Texas, with production facilities in Midlothian, Texas, south of Dallas/Fort Worth, and Hunter, Texas, north of San Antonio.  These plants produce Portland and specialty cements, have a combined\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1 – Business\nannual\nclinker\ncapacity of 4.5 million tons, and operated\nat 80%\nutilization in 20\n20\n.  The Midlothian plant permit allows the Company to expand production by up to\n0.8 million\nadditional tons.  In addition to the two production facilities, the Company operates several cement distribution terminals.  Calcium carbonate in the form of limestone is the principal raw material used in the production of cement.  The Company owns more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its cement production plants.\nReady mixed concrete, a mixture primarily consisting of cement, aggregates, sand and water, is measured in cubic yards and specifically batched or produced for customers’ construction projects and then transported and poured at the project site. The aggregates used for ready mixed concrete is a washed material with limited amounts of fines (such as dirt and clay). The Company operates 120 ready mix plants in Texas, Colorado and Wyoming.  Asphalt is most commonly used in surfacing roads and parking lots and consists of liquid asphalt, or bitumen, the binding medium, and aggregates. Similar to ready mixed concrete, each asphalt batch is produced to customer specifications. The Company’s asphalt and paving operations are exclusively in Colorado. Market dynamics for these downstream product lines include a highly competitive environment and lower barriers to entry compared with aggregates and cement.\nThe Building Materials Business markets its products primarily to the construction industry, with 36% of aggregates shipments in 2020 to contractors in connection with highway and other public infrastructure projects and the balance of its shipments primarily to contractors for nonresidential and residential construction projects. The Company also believes exposure to fluctuations in nonresidential and residential, or private-sector, construction spending is lessened by the business’ mix of public sector-related shipments.\nFunding of public infrastructure, the Company’s largest end-use market, is discussed in greater detail under “\n” in\n,’’ of this Form 10-K.\nThe Building Materials Business covers a wide geographic area.  The five largest revenue-generating states (Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia, and Iowa) accounted for 71% of the Building Materials Business’ total revenues by state of destination in 2020.  The Building Materials Business is accordingly affected by the economies in these regions and has been adversely affected in part by recessions and weaknesses in these economies from time to time. In 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic impacted the global economy.  The Company, being considered an essential business, continued to operate but experienced a modest volume decline in aggregates shipments due to a slowdown in overall construction activity.  However, management believes this slowdown represents a delay rather than cancellations of projects.\nNatural aggregates sources can be found in relatively homogeneous deposits in certain areas of the United States.  As a general rule, the distance covered by truck shipments from an individual quarry is limited because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the price of the product itself. As described below, the Company’s distribution system mainly uses trucks, but also has access to a waterborne network where the per-mile unit cost of transporting aggregates is much lower.  In addition, acquisitions have enabled the Company to extend its customer base through increased access to rail transportation. Proximity of quarry facilities to customers or to long-haul transportation corridors is an important factor in competition for aggregates businesses.\nThe Company’s distribution network moves aggregates materials from domestic and offshore sources via its long-haul rail and waterborne distribution network, to markets where aggregates supply is limited.  The Company’s rail network primarily serves its Texas, Florida, Colorado and Gulf Coast markets while the Company’s locations in The Bahamas and Nova Scotia transport materials via oceangoing ships. The Company’s strategic focus includes expanding inland and offshore capacity and acquiring distribution facilities and port locations to offload transported material.  At December 31, 2020, the Company’s distribution facilities consisted of 84 terminals.  The long-haul distribution network can diversify market risk for locations that engage in long-haul transportation of their aggregates products.  The risk of a downturn in one market may be somewhat mitigated by other markets served by the location, particularly where a producing quarry serves a local market and transports products via rail, water and/or truck to be sold in other markets.  As the Company continues to move more aggregates by rail and water, associated internal freight costs are expected to reduce gross margin.  This typically occurs where the Company transports aggregates from a production location to a distribution location, and the customer pays a selling price that includes a freight component.  Margins are negatively affected because the Company typically does not charge the customer a profit associated with the transportation component of the selling price of the materials.  Moreover, the Company’s expansion of its rail-based distribution network, coupled with the extensive use of rail service, increases the Company’s dependence on and exposure to railroad performance, including track congestion, crew availability, railcar availability, locomotive availability, and the ability to renegotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts.  The waterborne distribution network also increases the Company’s exposure to certain risks, including, among other items, meeting minimum tonnage\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1 – Business\nrequirements of shipping contracts, demurrage costs, fuel costs, ship availability and weather disruptions.  The Company has long-term agreements\nwith shipping companies to provide ships to transport the Company’s aggregates to various coastal ports.\nThe Company generally acquires contiguous property around existing quarry locations. This property can serve as buffer property or additional mineral reserve capacity, assuming the underlying geology supports economical aggregates mining. In either instance, the acquisition of additional property around an existing quarry allows the expansion of the quarry footprint and extension of quarry life. Some locations having limited reserves may be unable to expand.\nA long-term capital focus for the Company, primarily in the midwestern United States due to the nature of its indigenous aggregates supply, is underground limestone aggregates mines. Production costs are generally higher at underground mines than surface quarries since the depth of the aggregates deposits and the access to the reserves result in higher costs related to development, explosives and depreciation costs. However, these locations often possess marketplace transportation advantages that can lead to higher average selling prices than more distant surface quarries.\nThe construction aggregates industry has been consolidating, and the Company has actively participated in the industry’s consolidation. When acquired, new locations sometimes do not satisfy the Company’s internal safety, maintenance, pit development, or other standards, and may require additional resources before benefits of the acquisitions are fully realized. Industry consolidation slowed several years ago as the number of suitable small- to mid-sized acquisition targets in high-growth markets declined. During that period of fewer acquisition opportunities, the Company focused on investing in internal expansion or efficiency projects in high-growth markets. The number of acquisition opportunities has increased in the last several years as the economy recovered from the protracted recession.  Opportunities include public and large private, family-owned businesses, as well as asset swaps and divestitures from companies executing their strategic plans, rationalizing non-core assets, and repairing financially-constrained balance sheets. The Company’s Board of Directors (the Board of Directors) and management continue to review and monitor the Company’s long-term strategic plans, commonly referred to as SOAR (Strategic Operating Analysis and Review), which include assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses, increasing the Company’s presence in its core businesses, investing in internal\nexpansion projects in high-growth markets, and pursuing new opportunities related to the Company’s existing markets.\nThe Company reports cement and downstream operations within the Building Materials Business’ West Group reportable segment; their results are affected by volatile factors, including fuel costs, operating efficiencies and weather, to a greater extent than the Company’s aggregates operations.  Liquid asphalt and cement serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete, respectively.  Therefore, fluctuations in prices for these raw materials directly affect the Company’s operating results.\nEnvironmental and zoning regulations have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries and to develop new quarry operations. Although it cannot be predicted what policies will be adopted in the future by federal, state, and local governmental bodies regarding these matters, the Company anticipates that future restrictions will likely make zoning and permitting more difficult, thereby potentially enhancing the value of the Company’s existing mineral reserves.\nManagement believes its aggregates reserves are sufficient to permit production at present operational levels for the foreseeable future. The Company does not anticipate any significant difficulty in obtaining reserves used for production. The Company’s aggregates reserves average approximately 90 years, based on current production levels. However, certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand. Moreover, as noted above, environmental and zoning regulations\nwill likely make it harder for the Company to expand its existing quarries or develop new quarry operations\n.\nThe Company generally sells its aggregates, ready mixed concrete and asphalt products upon receipt of customer orders or requests. The Company generally maintains inventories of aggregates products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of customers.\nCement\nThe cement operations of the Building Materials Business produce Portland and specialty cements. Similar to aggregates, cement is used in infrastructure projects, nonresidential and residential construction, and the railroad, agricultural, utility and environmental industries.\nConsequently, the cement industry is cyclical and dependent on the strength of the construction sector.\nCement consumption is dependent on the time of year and prevalent weather conditions. According to the Portland Cement Association, nearly two-thirds of U.S. cement consumption occurs in the six months between May and October.  Approximately 70% - 75% of all cement shipments are sent to ready mixed concrete operators. The rest are shipped to\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1 – Business\nmanufacturers of concrete-related products, contractors, materials dealers\nand\noil well/mining/drilling companies, as well as government entities.\nEnergy accounted for approximately 21% of the cement production cost profile in 2020. Therefore, profitability of cement is affected by changes in energy prices and the available supply of these products.  The Company currently has fixed-price supply contracts for coal but also consumes natural gas, alternative fuel and petroleum coke. Further, profitability of the cement operations is also subject to kiln maintenance, which typically requires a plant to be shut down for a period of time.\nThe limestone reserves used as a raw material for cement are located on Company-owned property, adjacent to each of the two cement plants.  Management believes that its reserves of limestone are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future.\nThe cement operations generally deliver its products upon receipt of customer orders or requests.  Inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers\n.\nMagnesia Specialties Business\nThe Magnesia Specialties business produces and sells dolomitic lime from its Woodville, Ohio facility and manufactures magnesia-based chemical products for industrial, agricultural and environmental applications at its Manistee, Michigan facility.  These magnesia-based chemical products have varying uses, including flame retardants, wastewater treatment, pulp and paper production and other environmental applications.  In 2020, 67% of Magnesia Specialties’ total revenues were attributable to chemical products, 32% to lime, and 1% to stone sold as construction materials.\nIn 2020, 79% of the lime produced in the Magnesia Specialties business was sold to third-party customers, while the remaining 21% was used internally as a raw material in making the business’ chemical products.  Dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are used primarily by the steel industry.  Products used in the steel industry, either directly as dolomitic lime or indirectly as a component of other industrial products, accounted for 34% of the Magnesia Specialties’ total revenues in 2020, attributable primarily to the sale of dolomitic lime products. Accordingly, a portion of the revenues and profitability of the Magnesia Specialties business is affected by production and inventory trends in the steel industry.  These trends are guided by the rate of consumer consumption, the flow of offshore imports, and other economic factors. The dolomitic lime business runs most profitably at 70% or greater steel capacity utilization; domestic capacity utilization was negatively impacted by COVID-19 and averaged 65% in 2020, according to the Federal Reserve.  Steel production in 2020 decreased 18% versus 2019.\nIn the Magnesia Specialties business, a significant portion of costs is of a fixed or semi-fixed nature.  The production process requires the use of natural gas, coal and petroleum coke.  Therefore, fluctuations in their pricing directly affect operating results.  To help mitigate this risk, the Magnesia Specialties business has fixed-price agreements for approximately 63% of its 2021 coal, natural gas and petroleum coke needs.  For 2020, the Company’s average cost per MCF (thousand cubic feet) for natural gas decreased 9% versus 2019.\nGiven high fixed costs, low capacity utilization can negatively affect the segment’s results from operations. Management expects future organic profit growth to result from increased pricing, efficiency enhancements, rationalization of the current product portfolio and/or further cost reductions.  Management has shifted the strategic focus of the magnesia-based business to specialty chemicals that can be produced at volume levels that support efficient operations.  Accordingly, these products are not as dependent on the steel industry as the dolomitic lime product line.  However, demand for chemicals products in 2020 was negatively impacted by COVID-19.\nThe principal raw materials used in the Magnesia Specialties business are dolomitic limestone and magnesium-rich brine.  Management believes that its reserves of dolomitic limestone and brine are sufficient to permit production at the current operational levels for the foreseeable future.\nMagnesia Specialties generally delivers its products upon receipt of customer orders or requests. Inventory for products is generally maintained in sufficient quantities to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers. A significant portion of the 275,000-ton dolomitic lime capacity from a lime kiln at Woodville, Ohio is committed under a long-term supply contract.\nThe Magnesia Specialties business is highly dependent on rail transportation, particularly for movement of dolomitic lime from Woodville to Manistee and direct customer shipments of dolomitic lime and magnesia chemicals products from both Woodville and Manistee. The segment can be affected by the specific transportation and other risks and uncertainties outlined under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Form 10-K.\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1 – Business\nPatents and Trademarks\nAs of January 31, 2021, the Company owns, has the right to use, or has pending applications for patents pending or granted by the United States and various countries and trademarks related to its business. The Company believes that its rights under its existing patents, patent applications and trademarks are of value to its operations, but no one patent or trademark or group of patents or trademarks is material to the conduct of the Company’s business as a whole.\nCustomers\nNo material part of the business as a whole, or of any segment of the Company, is dependent upon a single customer or upon a few customers. The loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the segment. The Company’s products are sold principally to commercial customers in private industry. Although large amounts of construction materials are used in public works projects, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county, or municipal governments, or agencies thereof.\nCompetition\nThe nature of the Company’s competition varies among its products due to the widely differing amounts of capital necessary to build and maintain production facilities. Crushed stone production from quarries or mines, and sand and gravel production by dredging, is moderately capital intensive. Construction of cement production facilities is highly capital intensive and requires long lead times to complete engineering design, obtain regulatory permits, acquire equipment and construct a plant. Most domestic cement producers are owned by large foreign companies operating in multiple international markets. Many of these producers maintain the capability to import cement from foreign production facilities. Ready mixed concrete production requires relatively small amounts of capital to build a concrete batching plant and acquire delivery trucks. Accordingly, economics can lead to lower barriers to entry in some concrete markets. As a result, depending on the local market, the Company may face competition from small producers as well as large, vertically-integrated companies with facilities in many markets.\nThe Company operates in a largely-fragmented industry with over 5,000 domestic aggregates producers, including large, public companies and a large number of small, privately-held companies.  Other publicly traded companies among the ten largest U.S. aggregates producers include the following:\nDue to the localized nature of the industry resulting from the high cost of transportation relative to the price of the product, the Building Materials Business primarily operates in smaller distinct areas that can vary from one another.\nCapacity for cement plants is often stated in terms of “clinker” capacity; clinker is the initial product of cement production. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, United States cement production is widely dispersed, with the top five companies collectively producing approximately 61% of U.S. clinker capacity. An estimated 84% of U.S. clinker capacity is owned by companies headquartered outside of the United States. The Company’s cement operations also compete with imported cement because of the higher value of the product and the existence of major ports or terminals in Texas.\nThe Company’s ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are also in markets with numerous operators, large and small.\nThe Company believes that its ability to transport materials by rail and waterborne vessels has enhanced its ability to compete in the building materials industry.\nThe Magnesia Specialties business competes with various companies in different geographic and product areas principally on the basis of quality, price, technological advances, and technical support for its products. While the revenues of the Magnesia Specialties business in 2020 were predominantly domestic,\na portion was derived from customers located outside the United States.\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1 – Business\nEnvironmental and Governmental\nRegulations\nOverview\nThe Company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to zoning, land use, mining, air emissions (including CO\n2\nand other greenhouse gases), water use, allocation and discharges, waste management, noise and dust exposure control, reclamation and other environmental, health and safety, and regulatory matters. Certain of the Company’s operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous within the meaning of these laws and regulations. Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for certain of the Company’s operations, and such permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation.\nEnvironmental Compliance and Accruals\nThe Company regularly monitors and reviews its operations, procedures, and policies for compliance with existing laws and regulations, changes in interpretations of existing laws and enforcement policies, new laws that are adopted, and new laws that the Company anticipates will be adopted that could affect its operations. The Company has a full-time team of environmental engineers and managers that perform these responsibilities. The direct costs of ongoing environmental compliance were approximately $32.8 million in 2020 and $26.0 million in 2019 and are related to the Company’s environmental staff, ongoing monitoring costs for various matters (including those matters disclosed in this Form 10-K), and asset retirement costs. Capitalized costs related to environmental control facilities were approximately $17 million in 2020 and are expected to be approximately $15 million and $18 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively. The Company’s capital expenditures for environmental matters were not material to its results of operations or financial condition in 2020 and 2019. However, the Company’s expenditures for environmental matters generally have increased over time and are likely to increase in the future. Despite the Company’s compliance efforts, risk of environmental liability is inherent in the Company’s businesses, and environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company in the future.\nMany of the applicable requirements of environmental laws are satisfied by procedures that the Company adopts as best business practices in the ordinary course of its operations. For example, plant equipment that is used to crush aggregates products may, in the ordinary course of operations, have an attached water spray bar that is used to clean the stone. The water spray bar also serves as a dust control mechanism that complies with applicable environmental laws. Moreover, the Company does not separate the portion of the cost, depreciation, and other financial information relating to the water spray bar that is attributable only to environmental purposes, as such an allocation would be arbitrary. The incremental portion of such operating costs that is attributable to environmental compliance rather than best operating\npractices is impractical to quantify. Accordingly, the Company expenses costs in that category when incurred as operating expenses.\nAs is the case with others in the cement industry, the Company’s cement operations produce varying quantities of cement kiln dust (CKD). This production by-product consists of fine-grained, solid, highly alkaline material removed from cement kiln exhaust gas by air pollution control devices. Since much of the CKD is unreacted raw materials, it is generally permissible to recycle the CKD back into the production process, and large amounts often are treated in such manner. CKD that is not returned to the production process or sold as a product itself is disposed in landfills. CKD is currently exempted from federal hazardous waste regulations under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.\nThe environmental accruals recorded by the Company are based on internal studies of the required remediation costs and estimates of potential costs that arise from time to time under federal, state and/or local environmental protection laws. Many of these laws and their attendant regulations are complex, and are subject to challenges and new interpretations by regulators and the courts. In addition, new laws are also adopted from time to time. It is often difficult to accurately and fully quantify the costs to comply with new rules until it is determined to which type of operations they will apply and the manner in which they will be implemented is more accurately defined. This process typically takes years to finalize, and the rules often change significantly from the time they are proposed to the time they are final. The Company typically has several appropriate alternatives available to satisfy compliance requirements, which could range from nominal costs to some alternatives that may be satisfied in conjunction with equipment replacement or expansion that also benefits operating efficiencies or capacities and carry significantly higher costs.\nManagement believes that its current accrual for environmental costs is reasonable, although those amounts may increase or decrease depending on the impact of applicable rules as they are finalized or amended from time to time and changes in facts and circumstances.  The Company believes that its operations and facilities, both owned or leased, are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations or financial condition. See “Legal Proceedings” under Item 3 of this Form 10-K, “Note O:\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1 – Business\nCommitments and Contingencies” of the “Notes to Financial Statements” of the Company’s consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplemental Data,” of this Form 10-K, and\nthe\n“\nEnvironmental\nRegulation and Litigation”\nsection\nincluded under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of this Form 10-K.\nHowever, future events, such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies\n, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of certain products or business activities, may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nMine Safety and Land Reclamation\nIn general, mining, production and distribution facilities for aggregates, cement, ready mixed concrete, and asphalt must comply with air quality, water quality, and other environmental regulations, zoning and special use permitting requirements, applicable mining regulations, and federal health and safety requirements. As the Company locates and acquires new production and distribution facilities, the Company works closely with local authorities during the zoning and permitting processes to design new quarries, mines, production and distribution facilities in such a way as to minimize disturbances. The Company frequently acquires large tracts of land so that quarry, mine, production and distribution facilities can be situated with substantial distance from surrounding property owners. Also, in certain markets the Company’s ability to transport material by rail and water allows it to locate its facilities further away from residential areas. The Company has established policies designed to minimize disturbances to surrounding property owners from its operations.\nAs is the case with other similarly situated companies, some of the Company’s products contain varying amounts of crystalline silica, a common mineral also known as quartz. Excessive, prolonged inhalation of very small-sized particles of crystalline silica has been associated with lung diseases, including silicosis, and several scientific organizations and some states, such as California, have reported that crystalline silica can cause lung cancer. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have established occupational thresholds for crystalline silica exposure as respirable dust. The Company monitors occupational exposures at its facilities and implements dust control procedures and/or makes available appropriate respiratory protective equipment to maintain the occupational exposures at or below the appropriate levels. The Company, through safety information sheets and other means, also communicates what it believes to be appropriate warnings and cautions its employees and customers about the risks associated with excessive, prolonged inhalation of mineral dust in general and crystalline silica in particular.\nThe Company is generally required by state or local laws or pursuant to the terms of an applicable lease to reclaim quarry sites after use. Future reclamation costs are estimated using statutory reclamation requirements and management’s experience and knowledge in the industry, and are discounted to their present value using a credit-adjusted, risk-free interest rate. The future reclamation costs are not offset by potential recoveries. For additional information regarding compliance with legal requirements, see “\n” of the “\n” of the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in\nof this Form 10-K. The Company performs activities on an ongoing basis, as an integral part of the normal quarrying process, that may reduce the ultimate reclamation obligations. For example, the perimeter and interior walls of an open pit quarry are sloped and benched as they are developed to prevent erosion and provide stabilization. This sloping and benching meets dual objectives -- safety regulations required by MSHA for ongoing operations as well as final reclamation requirements. Therefore, these types of activities are included in normal operating costs and are not a part of the asset retirement obligation.\nHistorically, the Company has not incurred substantial reclamation costs in connection with the closing of quarries. Reclaimed\nquarry sites owned by the Company are from time to time available for sale, typically for commercial development or use as reservoirs.\nGreenhouse Gases and Climate Change\nAmid concerns that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are contributing to climate change, a number of governmental bodies, including the U.S. Congress and various U.S. states, have proposed, enacted or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes to mitigate or address the potential impacts of climate change, including provisions for emissions reporting or reductions, the use of alternative fuels, carbon credits (such as a \"cap and trade\" system) and a carbon tax. For example, in the United States, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) promulgated a rule mandating that sources considered to be large emitters of GHGs report those emissions. The manufacturing operations of the Company’s Magnesia Specialties business release carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides during the production of lime, magnesium oxide and hydroxide products. The Company’s two magnesia-based chemicals facilities, as well as its two cement plants in Texas, file annual reports of their GHG emissions in accordance with the USEPA reporting rule. The primary operations of the Company, however, including its aggregates, ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines, are not major sources of GHG\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1 – Business\nemissions. In fact, most of the GHG emissions from aggregates plant operations are tailpipe emissions from mobile sources, such as heavy construction and earth-moving equipment.\nIn 2010, the USEPA also issued a GHG emissions permitting rule, referred to as the “Tailoring Rule,” which may require some industrial facilities to obtain permits for GHG emissions under the U.S. Clean Air Act’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V operating permit programs. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2014 that the USEPA exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the Tailoring Rule but upheld the Best Available Control Technology (BACT) requirements for GHGs emitted by sources already subject to PSD or Title V permitting requirements for other pollutants. Both of the Company’s cement plants, as well as its Magnesia Specialties plants, hold Title V Permits, and each (other than the Manistee, Michigan facility) is also subject to PSD requirements.  With the change of the U.S. presidential administration, it is too early to determine whether the USEPA will proceed with revisions of the Tailoring Rule or proceed otherwise. It is also unknown how the USEPA may revise BACT requirements. In fact, although several large-scale projects for carbon capture are in the development phase, no technologies or methods of operation for reducing or capturing GHGs have been proven successful in large scale applications, other than improvements in fuel efficiency. Thus, if future modifications to our facilities require PSD review for other pollutants, GHG BACT requirements could be triggered and may require significant additional costs. However, it is currently impossible to estimate the cost of any such future requirements.\nU.S. President Biden has made climate change a central focus of his administration.  In addition to re-entering the Paris Agreement on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued a pair of executive orders and a presidential memorandum making the climate change central to U.S. Policy and setting out several administrative priorities and undertakings.  Although it is still too early to determine the actions the federal governmental will take to implement the orders, or the full scope, timing or ramifications of such measures, it is clear that the administration intends to make a significant and sweeping push on the climate front and, like other signatories to the Paris Agreement, intends to pursue a goal of a Net Zero GHG by 2050. The orders, combined with democratic control of both chambers of the 117\nth\nU.S. Congress, suggest that additional executive and/or legislative action is likely, although the timing and scope of such action is unclear. It also seems probable that the USEPA and other agencies will likely use their rule-making authority and procurement decisions to further address climate change. Various states where the Company has operations are considering climate change initiatives as well, and the Company may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed.\nIf and when the USEPA issues new regulations and/or Congress passes additional legislation on GHGs, the Woodville, Ohio and Manistee, Michigan Magnesia Specialties operations, as well as the Company’s two cement plants in Texas, which release CO\n2\nin certain of their processes and use carbon-based fuels for power equipment, kilns and the Company’s mobile fleet, will likely be subject to any new requirements. The Company anticipates that any increased operating costs or taxes relating to GHG emission limitations at the Woodville or cement operations facilities would be passed on to customers. The magnesium oxide products produced at the Manistee operation, however, compete against other products that, due to the form and/or structure of the source material, require less energy in the calcination process, resulting in the generation of fewer GHGs per ton of production. Therefore, the Manistee facility may be required to absorb additional costs due to the regulation of GHG emissions in order to remain competitive in pricing in that market. In addition, the cement produced by the Company’s two plants in Texas, like other U.S. operators, is subject to strict limits set by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and other agencies, including those relating to “clinker substitution”, or the replacement of ground clinker in cement with alternate materials such as pozzolan, slag and fly ash, which has implications for the Company’s fuel use and efforts to reduce GHG emissions from its operations.  For example, various industry associations are engaged in an effort to ask the U.S. DOT and other agencies to revise their standards allowing for greater rates of clinker substitution, similar to the rates currently permitted for European cement producers.  If higher rates of substitution and blending are, in fact, permitted in the future, the result is likely to be both reduced clinker and power consumption in cement production, which would, in turn, reduce GHGs emitted in connection with each ton of cement produced in the U.S.\nIn light of the various regulatory uncertainties, the Company at this time cannot reasonably predict what the costs of any future compliance requirements may be. Nonetheless, the Company does not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the Magnesia Specialties business or Building Materials Business. The Company continues to monitor GHG regulations and legislation and its potential impact on the Company’s cement business, financial condition and product demand.\nIn addition to impacts from increased regulation, climate change may result in physical and financial impacts that could have adverse effects on the Company’s operations or financial condition. Physical impacts may include disruptions in production and/or regional supply or product distribution networks due to major storm events, shifts in regional rainfall and temperature patterns and intensities, as well as flooding from sea level changes. In addition, production and shipment levels for the Building Materials Business correlate with general construction activity, which occurs outdoors and, as a result, is affected by erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes and other unusual or unexpected weather-related conditions, which\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1 – Business\ncan significantly affect that business.\nExcessive rainfall and other severe weather jeopardize production, shipments and profitability in all markets served by the Company.\nIn addition, climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset. In particular, the Company’s operations in the southeastern and Gulf Coast regions of the United States and\nT\nhe Bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity, most notably in August, September and October. The last few years brought an unprecedented amount of precipitation to the United States and particularly to Texas and the southeastern United States, notably the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia, where\nit\nimpacted the Company’s facilities.\nThe Company’s businesses also are dependent on reliable sources of electricity and fuels. The Company could incur increased costs or disruptions in its operations if climate change regulation or severe weather impacts the price or availability of electricity or fuels or other materials used in its operations. These and other climate-related risks also could impact the Company’s customers, such as a downturn in the construction sector, which could lead to reduced demand for the Company’s products. The Company may not be able to pass on to its customers all the costs relating to these risks.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing risks and uncertainties relating to climate change, there may also be opportunities for the Company to increase its business or revenues. For example, warm and/or moderate temperatures in March and November allow the construction season to start earlier and end later, respectively, which could have meaningful positive impacts on the Company’s first- and fourth-quarter results, respectively. In addition, the Company’s magnesium hydroxide products are used to increase fuel efficiency in various industries, including both coal- and gas-fired electricity generation, which has a direct impact on reducing energy use and GHG emissions by more GHG-intense companies. Finally, the desire for sustainable building solutions has led to greater recognition of the benefits of concrete construction in the effort to move to a circular economy thorough innovative products, longevity and recyclability, and increased demand for green construction projects would have a direct impact on the Company’s cement and concrete business.\nIn an effort to mitigate the risks to the Company associated with GHG emissions while ensuring and improving financial sustainability, the Company has adopted a corporate-wide management strategy that has resulted in multiple operating initiatives to implement or evaluate GHG reduction processes and technologies that also improve operational efficiencies, including: using alternative fuels such as biodiesel; reducing overall fuel use by converting from quarry trucks to conveyor belt systems; right-sizing quarry trucks to marry the appropriately sized truck with the size of production to reduce the number of required trips; replacing older railcars with more efficient, high-capacity models that reduce the number of required trips; adding rail capacity in lieu of truck movements; and installing emissions monitoring equipment and real-time fleet management software. For example, in 2015, the Company’s Midlothian cement plant was recognized by the USEPA as a high performing, energy efficient facility following investments in innovative air pollution control technologies and usage of alternative fuels.\nLand Management\nThe Company owns approximately 140,000 acres of land, the vast majority of which is used in connection with active facilities. The Company regularly reviews its land holdings to determine their highest and best use based on its management expertise, and sell or develop for sale surplus property. Land holdings that do not have economically recoverable reserves for current or future mining or are otherwise not in locations that complement the Company’s operating facilities are considered as candidates for sale.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2021, the Company has\napproximately 8,700\nemployees, of which approximately 6,600 are hourly employees and approximately 2,100 are salaried employees. Included among these employees are nearly 900 hourly employees represented by labor unions (10.3% of the Company’s employees). Of such amount,\n9.7\n% of the Building Materials Business’ hourly employees are members of a labor union and\n100\n% of the Magnesia Specialties segment’s hourly employees are represented by labor unions. The Company’s principal union contracts for the Magnesia Specialties business cover employees at the Manistee, Michigan, magnesia-based chemicals plant and the Woodville, Ohio, lime plant. The Woodville and Manistee collective bargaining agreements expire June 2022 and August 2023, respectively. The Company believes it has good relations with its employees, including its unionized employees. While the Company’s management does not expect material difficulties in renewing these labor contracts, there can be no assurance that a successor agreement will be reached at any of these locations.\nManagement believes the Company’s success depends on its ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel. None of Martin Marietta’s accomplishments, and nothing it has achieved, would be possible without its employees; the people who both drive the work and are most affected by it. These individuals are the heart of Martin Marietta. The Company’s management oversees various employee initiatives to foster and improve its employees and the Management Development and Compensation Committee regularly reviews the compensation program to achieve those objectives.\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1 – Business\nHealth and safety in the workplace is one of the Company’s core values.\nThe\nGuardian Angel safety program provides that every employee has the right, and the obligation, to stop any unsafe condition and that zero safety incidents is achievable. It includes the concept that every employee acts as a wingman for other employees, to observe and act on any situation that potentially creates unsafe circumstances.\nThe\ncompanywide safety performance, inclusive of our more recently acquired operations, continues to deliver near or better than world-class safety levels. In 2020, 90\n%\nof\nthe Company’s\nbusiness units worked without a reportable incident and 99\n%\nof\nits\nbusiness units worked without a lost-time incident, achieving a world-class lost-time incident rate for the fourth consecutive year.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of keeping the Company’s employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, the Company has taken actions aligned with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to implement robust protocols to protect its workforce so that they can safely perform their jobs.\nThe Company established a new employer brand in 2019 — ONE — that reflects the thoughts, feelings and hearts of employees at every level of Martin Marietta. This included a standard approach to safety mentoring that ensures every employee has the knowledge and resources needed to complete their work safely and efficiently. The Company also established a World Class Task Force, whose mission is to improve Martin Marietta and is fostering a level of communication never before seen at the Company. In 2020, the Company launched an Inclusion and Engagement Steering Committee, comprised of diverse employees across the Company. The Company has taken these steps to better allow it to grow responsibly and encourage employee engagement.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company maintains an internet address at\nwww.martinmarietta.com\n.

    "text": "An investment in Martin Marietta common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. You should consider the following factors carefully, in addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase or otherwise trade the Company’s securities.\nThis Form 10-K and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the Company contain statements that, to the extent they are not recitations of historical fact, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities law. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and are based on assumptions that the Company believes in good faith are reasonable, but which may be materially different from actual results. Investors can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate only to historic or current facts. The words “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “scheduled,” and similar expressions in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Any or all of the Company’s forward-looking statements in this Form 10‑K and in other publications may turn out to be wrong.\nStatements and assumptions on future revenues, income and cash flows, performance, economic trends, the outcome of litigation, regulatory compliance, and environmental remediation cost estimates are examples of forward-looking statements. Numerous factors, including potentially the risk factors described in this section, could affect our forward-looking statements and actual performance.\nInvestors are also cautioned that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties. Other factors besides those listed may also adversely affect the Company and may be material to the Company. The Company has listed the known material risks it considers relevant in evaluating the Company and its operations. The forward-looking statements in this document are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof based on management’s current expectations, and the Company does not undertake an obligation to update such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, other than as required by law.\nFor a discussion identifying some important factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, see the factors listed below, along with the discussion of “Competition” under Item 1 of this Form 10-K, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under Item 7 of this Form 10-K, and “Note A: Accounting Policies” and “Note O: Commitments and Contingencies” of the “Notes to Financial Statements” of the Company’s consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplemental Data,” of this Form 10-K.\nIndustry and COVID-19 Risk Factors\nOur business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry\nEconomic and political uncertainty can impede growth in the markets in which we operate. Demand for our products, particularly in the private nonresidential and residential construction markets, could decline if companies and consumers are unable to obtain credit for construction projects or if an economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations of capital projects. State and federal budget issues may also hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending. The lack of available credit may limit the ability of states to issue bonds to finance construction projects. As a result of these issues, several of our top revenue-generating states, from time-to-time, stop bidding or slow bid projects in their transportation departments.\nWe sell most of our aggregates (our primary business) and our cement products, to the construction industry, therefore our results depend on that industry’s strength. Since our businesses depend on construction spending, which can be cyclical, our profits are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and the intensity of the underlying spending on aggregates and cement products. Construction spending is affected by economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic and population shifts, and changes in construction spending by federal, state and local governments. If economic conditions change, a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our products. The recession of the late 2000s and early 2010s (the Great Recession) was an example, and our shipment volumes were significantly reduced.  Construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts.\nWhile our business operations cover a wide geographic area, our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their selling price.  If economic conditions\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1A – Risk Factors\nand construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas, particularly in\nthe Building Materials\nBusiness’\ntop five\nrevenue\n-generating states of Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Iowa\n,\nour profitability will decrease.\nWe experienced this situation\nduring\nthe Great Recession.\nThe Great Recession resulted in large declines in shipments of aggregates products in our industry. Subsequent to the Great Recession and until the impact from COVID-19 beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we experienced slow-but-steady construction growth that coincided with the longest economic recovery in United States history.\nWhile historical spending on public infrastructure projects has been, comparatively, more stable as governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest rate-sensitive than private sector spending, we experienced a slight retraction in aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market after uncertainty regarding the passage of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014. Contractors were not able to get any certainty on the availability of federal infrastructure funding until late 2015 with the enactment of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act.\nOur Building Materials Business is seasonal and subject to the weather, which can significantly impact operations\nSince the heavy-side construction business is conducted outdoors, erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions affect our business. Adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms, cold weather, snow and heavy or sustained rainfall, reduce construction activity, restrict the demand for our products and impede our ability to efficiently transport material. Adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss, needed plant and equipment repairs, time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events. Severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies and restrict production. Production and shipment levels of the Building Materials Business’ products follow activity in the construction industry, which typically are strongest in the spring, summer and fall. Because of the weather’s effect on the construction industry’s activity, the production and shipment levels for the Company’s Building Materials Business, including all of its aggregates-related downstream operations, vary by quarter. The second and third quarters are generally subject to heavy precipitation, and thus are more profitable if precipitation is lighter, while the first and fourth quarters are subject to the impacts of winter weather, and thus are generally the least profitable. The Company’s operations in the southeastern and Gulf Coast regions of the United States and The Bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity, most notably in August, September and October.\nOur businesses could be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or any other outbreak of disease, epidemic or pandemic, or similar public health threat, or fear of such an event and its related economic and societal response\nOur businesses could be negatively impacted by the widespread outbreak of an illness or other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis that results in economic and trade disruptions. In or around December 2019, COVID-19 was initially reported. Four months later, in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared it a global pandemic. The proliferation of COVID-19 cases in the United States, and the extent that geography of outbreaks primarily matches the regions in which the Company’s Building Materials Business principally operates, in combination with the related governmental orders limiting individuals’ movements and social gatherings, as well as requiring many businesses to close for an undetermined period of time, are negatively impacting economic activity, consumer confidence and discretionary spending, and overall market conditions.\nFurther, COVID-19 could continue to negatively affect the health of our employees, employee productivity, customer purchasing patterns and fulfillment of purchase orders, availability of supplies, pricing for raw materials, and the ability to transport materials via the Company’s distribution network. While our operations have been designated as “essential” under applicable government orders otherwise restricting business activities to prevent further outbreak of COVID-19, and accordingly have been permitted to continue to operate during the pendency of these orders, it is possible that they may not continue to be so treated under future government orders, or, even if so treated, site-specific health and safety concerns might otherwise require certain of the Company’s operations to be halted for some period of time. We are monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and on our product demand. Due to economic uncertainty related to COVID-19, contractors and customers may delay advancing, or ultimately cancel, building projects. In addition, reduced travel due to remote working and stay-at-home practices, including as a result of governmental orders restricting activity, may continue to negatively impact fuel tax revenues that fund highway projects.  While we do not currently expect that the virus will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity, we are unable to accurately and fully predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on the results of operations due to various uncertainties, including the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1A – Risk Factors\nother third-parties in response to COVID-19 and the timing and pace of any economic recovery as COVID-19 impacts ultimately abate.\nCompetition and Growth Risk Factors\nOur Building Materials Business depends on the availability of quality aggregates reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically\nOur challenge is to find quality aggregates deposits that we can mine economically, with appropriate permits, near either growing markets or long-haul transportation corridors that economically serve applicable markets. As communities have grown, they have settled in and around attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining. We try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion, buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves, developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various methods, including rail and water. While our distribution network allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical, we can give no assurances that we will be successful at this strategy.\nOur businesses face many competitors\nOur businesses have many competitors, some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do. Some of our competitors operate on a worldwide basis. Our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market, the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate, the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market. We also face competition for some of our products from alternative products. For example, our Magnesia Specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesia-based products. As other examples, our aggregates, ready mixed concrete, and asphalt and paving businesses may compete with recycled asphalt and concrete products that could be used instead of new products and our cement operations may compete with international competitors who are importing products into the United States from jurisdictions with lower production and regulatory costs.\nOur future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry, and we may acquire businesses by paying all or in part with shares of our common stock\nWe expect to continue to grow, in part, by acquiring other businesses. In the past, we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations, expand our operations and enter new geographic markets. We will continue to pursue selective acquisitions, joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our Company. However, the continued success of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at an appropriate price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations. We cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations.\nWe may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock. We may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations. If we use our common stock in this way, the ownership interests of our existing shareholders at that time will be diluted and the price of our stock could decline. We operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing long-term shareholder return.\nOur integration of the acquisition or business combination with other businesses may not be as successful as projected\nWe have a successful history of business combinations and integration of these businesses into our heritage operations. However, in connection with the integration of any other business that we acquire, there is a risk that we will not be able to achieve such integration in a successful manner or on the time schedule we have projected or in a way that will achieve the level of synergies, cost savings or operating efficiencies we forecast from the acquisition.\nAny other significant business acquisition or combination we might choose to undertake may require that we devote significant management attention and resources to preparing for and then integrating our business practices and operations. Based on our history, we believe we would be successful in this integration process. Nevertheless, we may fail to realize some of the anticipated benefits of any potential acquisition or other business combination that we pursue in the future, if the\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1A – Risk Factors\nintegration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include:\nOur acquisitions could harm our results of operations\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities and enter into acquisition agreements. Acquisitions involve significant challenges and risks, including risks that:\nOur cement and Magnesia Specialties businesses may become capacity-constrained\nIf our cement or Magnesia Specialties businesses becomes capacity-constrained, we may be unable to timely satisfy the demand for some of our products, and any resulting changes in customers would introduce volatility to the earnings of these segments. We can address capacity needs by enhancing our manufacturing productivity, increasing the operational availability of equipment, reducing machinery down time and extending machinery useful life. Future demand for our products may require us to expand our manufacturing capacity further, particularly through the purchase of additional manufacturing equipment. However, we may not be able to increase our capacity in time to satisfy increases in demand that may occur from time to time. Capacity constraints may prevent us from satisfying customer orders and result in a loss of sales to competitors that are not capacity-constrained. In addition, we may suffer excess capacity if we increase our capacity to meet actual or anticipated demand and that demand decreases or does not materialize. While we are permitted to expand production by up to 0.8 million additional tons at our Midlothian cement plant, it could take us a significant period of time before such production expansion could come to fruition.\nOur cement business could suffer if cement imports from other countries significantly increase or are sold in the U.S. in violation of U.S. fair trade laws\nIn the past, the cement industry has obtained antidumping orders imposing duties on imports of cement and clinker from other countries that violated U.S. fair trade laws. Currently, an antidumping order against cement and clinker from Japan is set to expire but is under review for extension by the Federal Trade Commission. As has always been the case, cement operators with import facilities can purchase cement from other countries, such as those in Latin America and Asia, which could compete with domestic producers. In addition, if environmental regulations increase the costs of domestic producers compared to foreign producers that are not subject to similar regulations, imported cement could achieve a significant cost\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1A – Risk Factors\nadvantage over domestically produced cement. An influx of cement or clinker products from countries not subject to antidumping orders, or sales of imported cement or clinker in violation of U.S. fair trade laws, could adversely affect our cement product line.\nEconomic, Political and Legal Risk Factors\nChanges in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning, land use, the environment, health and safety and other areas of the law, as well as litigation relating to these matters, affect our businesses. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities\nMany federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning, land use, air emissions (including carbon dioxide and other GHGs), water use, allocation and discharges, waste management, noise and dust control, mining, reclamation and other environmental, health and safety matters govern our operations. Some of our operations require permits, which may impose additional operating standards, and are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. Certain of our operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous within the meaning of these laws and regulations. Despite our extensive efforts to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations, the risk of liabilities, particularly environmental liabilities, is inherent in the operation of our businesses. These potential liabilities could result in material costs, including for fines or personal injury or damages claims, which could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability.\nFuture events, including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities may result in additional or unanticipated compliance and other costs. We could be required to invest in preventive or remedial action, like pollution control facilities, which could be substantial or which could result in restrictions on our operations or delays in obtaining required permits or other approvals.\nOur operations are subject to manufacturing, operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations, including the related storage and transportation of raw materials, explosives, products, hazardous substances and wastes. We are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks, explosions, discharges or releases of hazardous substances, exposure to dust, and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery.\nThese risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death, or property damage, and may result in civil or criminal penalties, which could hurt our productivity or profitability. For example, from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations, as well as operations we have acquired from others, and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties.\nWe are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations. While we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation\nwill have a material adverse effect on our operations or our\nfinancial condition\n, an\nunexpected and material adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action could potentially have a negative effect on our Company.\nClimate change and related legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business, including potential physical and financial impacts\nAmid concerns that GHG emissions are contributing to climate change, a number of governmental bodies, including the U.S. Congress and various U.S. states, have proposed, enacted or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes to mitigate or address the potential impacts of climate change, including provisions for emissions reductions or the use of alternative fuels, carbon credits (such as a \"cap and trade\" system) and a carbon tax. For example, in the U.S., the USEPA promulgated a mandatory reporting rule covering GHG emissions from sources considered to be large emitters. The USEPA has also promulgated a GHG emissions permitting rule, referred to as the Tailoring Rule, which may require some industrial facilities to obtain operating permits for GHG emissions under the U.S. Clean Air Act. Although the U.S. Supreme Court subsequently ruled in June 2014 that the USEPA exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the Tailoring Rule but upheld the BACT requirements for GHGs emitted by sources that already require Title V operating permits or are subject to PSD requirements for other pollutants. With the change of the U.S. presidential administration, it is too early to tell whether the USEPA will proceed with revisions of the Tailoring Rule or proceed in a different direction, nor is it known how the USEPA may revise the BACT requirements. If future modifications to our Magnesia Specialties or cement facilities require PSD review for other pollutants, GHG permitting requirements may also be triggered, which could require us to incur significant additional costs. It is not possible, however, to estimate the cost of any future requirements at this time.\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1A – Risk Factors\nU.S. President Biden has made climate change a central focus of his administration.  In addition to reentering the Paris Agreement,\non January 27,\n2021,\nPresident Biden issued a pair of executive orders and a presidential memorandum making the climate change central to U\n.\nS\n.\nPolicy and setting out several administrative priorities and undertakings.  Although it is still too early to determine the actions the federal governmental will take to implement the orders, or the full scope, timing or ramifications of such measures, it is clear that the administration intends to make a significant and sweeping push on the climate front and, like other signatories to the Paris Agreement, intends to pursue a goal of a Net Zero GHG by 2050.  The orders, combined with democratic control of both chambers of the U.S. Congress, suggest that additional executive and/or legislative action is likely, although the timing and scope of such action\nis\nunclear.\nAdditionally, i\nt seems probable that the USEPA and other agencies will likely use their rule-making authority and procurement decisions to further address climate change. Various states where\nwe have\noperations are considering climate change initiatives\nas well\n, and\nwe\nmay be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed.  In light of the various regulatory uncertainties,\nwe\ncannot at this time reasonably predict what the costs of any future compliance requirements may be, but we do not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the Magnesia Specialties\nbusiness\nor Building Materials\nB\nusiness.\nWe\ncontinue to monitor GHG regulations and legislation and its potential impact on our cement business, financial condition and product demand.\nAlthough our aggregates, ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are not major sources of GHG emissions, any additional regulatory restrictions on emissions of GHGs imposed by the USEPA will likely impact our magnesia-based chemicals operations in Woodville, Ohio, and Manistee, Michigan, as well as our two cement plants in Texas, each of which file annual reports of GHG emissions as required by the USEPA reporting rule. However, it is currently impossible to estimate the cost of any such future requirements at this time. In addition, we may not be able to recover any increased operating costs or taxes relating to GHG emission limitations at those plants from our customers in order to remain competitive in pricing in the relevant markets.\nIn addition to impacts from increased GHG and other climate-related regulation, climate change may result in physical and financial impacts that could have adverse effects on our operations or financial condition. Given the nature of our operations, physical impacts may include disruptions in production and/or regional supply or product distribution networks due to major storm events, shifts in regional rainfall and temperature patterns and intensities, as well as flooding from sea level changes. In addition, production and shipment levels for the Building Materials Business correlate with general construction activity, most of which occurs outdoors and, as a result, is affected by erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes and other unusual or unexpected weather-related conditions, which can significantly affect that business. Excessive rainfall and other severe weather events also jeopardize production, shipments and profitability in all markets served by our operations. In particular, our operations in the southeastern and Gulf Coast regions of the United States and The Bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity, most notably in August, September and October. In addition, climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset.\nOur businesses also are dependent on reliable sources of electricity and fuels. We could incur increased costs or disruptions in our operations if climate change legislation and regulation or severe weather impacts the price or availability of purchased electricity or fuels or other materials used in our operations. These and other climate-related risks also could impact our customers, such as a downturn in the construction sector, which could lead to reduced demand for our products. We may not be able to pass on to our customers all the costs related to mitigating these risks.\nThe overall impacts of climate change on our operations and the Company are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate. However, climate change legislation and regulation concerning GHGs could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business is dependent on funding from a combination of federal, state and local sources\nOur products are used in public infrastructure projects, which include the construction, maintenance and improvement of highways, streets, roads, bridges, schools and similar projects. Accordingly, our business is dependent on the level of federal, state, and local spending on these projects. The visibility into future federal infrastructure funding was clarified and stabilized to some extent in 2015 with the passage of the current federal highway bill, the FAST Act, which reauthorized federal highway and transportation funding programs. The FAST Act was extended for one year and now is set to expire September 30, 2021.  If a reauthorization bill is not finalized prior to the FAST Act expiration, the Company anticipates some level of funding would be continued with continuing resolutions. Uncertainty of federal funding has led to an increase in state and alternative methods of infrastructure funding. We expect to see increased infrastructure spending at the state and local levels in 2021, aided by $10 billion for state departments of transportation provided by the December 2020 federal stimulus package as well as $14 billion of approved ballot initiatives.  At the federal level, we expect to see stable infrastructure\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1A – Risk Factors\nspending in\n202\n1\nresulting from the FAST Act\nextension\n, but\nbeyond that\nwill be dependent on a successor\nbill\nto the\nFAST Act or continuing resolutions in the future for any greater federal impact on funding. Any enhanced federal infrastructure bill will require Congressional approval.\nWe cannot be assured, however, of such approval or of the existence, amount and timing of appropriations for spending on future projects.\nOur businesses could be impacted by rising interest rates\nOur operations are highly dependent upon the interest rate-sensitive construction and steelmaking industries. Therefore, our business in these industries may decline if interest rates rise and costs increase.\nNotably, demand in the residential construction market in which we sell our aggregates products is affected by interest rates which are currently at historically low levels. There can be no assurance, however, that interest rates will not increase in the future, affecting our business in an adverse manner. The residential construction market accounted for 24% of our aggregates shipments in 2020.\nAside from these inherent risks from within our operations, our earnings are also affected by changes in short-term interest rates. However, rising interest rates are not necessarily predictive of weaker operating results.\nRising interest rates could also result in disruptions in the credit markets, which could affect our business, as described in greater detail under “\nDisruptions in the credit markets could affect our business”\nbelow.\nIncreases in our effective income tax rate may harm our results of operations\nA number of factors may increase our future effective income tax rate, including:\nAny significant increase in our future effective income tax rate could reduce net earnings and free cash flow for future periods.\nPersonnel Risks\nLabor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses\nLabor unions represent approximately 10% of the hourly employees of our Building Materials Business and all of the hourly employees of our Magnesia Specialties business. Our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our Magnesia Specialties business at the Woodville, Ohio, lime plant and the Manistee, Michigan magnesia chemicals plant expire in June 2022 and August 2023, respectively.\nDisputes with our trade unions, or the inability to renew our labor agreements, could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses, raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations.\nWe depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of, and on our ability to attract and retain, our key personnel and executive officers, including qualified management, technical, marketing and sales, and support personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining such qualified personnel, which could negatively affect our business. In addition, because of our reliance on our senior management team, the\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1A – Risk Factors\nunanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and develop or recruit talent to succeed our senior management and other key positions throughout the organization. If we fail to identify and develop or recruit successors, we are at risk of being harmed by the departures of these key employees. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nFinancial, Accounting and Cost Management Risk Factors\nOur business is a capital-intensive business\nThe property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive. Therefore, we require large amounts of cash to operate our businesses. We believe that our cash on hand, along with our projected operating cash flows and our available financing resources, is adequate to support our anticipated operating and capital needs. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business, we may be required, among other things, to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures.\nOur earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies, which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management. Our estimates and assumptions could be wrong\nThe accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards. These estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments. If we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates, our financial results could differ.\nWhile we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate, we could be wrong. Accordingly, our financial results could be different, either higher or lower. We urge you to read the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section included under\nof the Form 10-K.\nThe adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results\nThe accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are periodically changed. New or revised accounting standards could, either positively or negatively, affect results reported for periods after adoption of the standards as compared to the prior periods, or require retrospective application changing results reported for prior periods. We urge you to read about our accounting policies in\nof our Consolidated financial statements included under\nof this Form 10-K.\nReports from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s (PCAOB) inspections of public accounting firms continue to outline findings and recommendations which could require these firms to perform additional work as part of their financial statement audits. Our costs to respond to these additional requirements may increase.\nDisruptions in the credit markets could affect our business\nWe have considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to our business. Demand for aggregates products, particularly in the infrastructure construction market, have been negatively affected by federal and state budget challenges and the uncertainty over future highway funding levels. Further, delays or cancellations to capital projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence is eroded by economic uncertainty.\nA recessionary construction economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on all of our accounts receivable with our customers. We are protected in part, however, by payment bonds posted by many of our customers or end-users as well as state lien rights. Nevertheless, we may experience a delay in payment from some of our customers during a construction downturn, which would negatively affect operating cash flows. Historically, our bad debt write-offs have not been significant to our operating results, and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate.\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1A – Risk Factors\nThe credit environment could impact\nour\nability to borrow money in the future. Additional financing or refinancing might not be available and, if available, may not be at economically favorable terms. Further, an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings.\nA reduction in our credit ratings, regardless of the cause, could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing and/or increase our cost of obtaining financing. There is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates, which could negatively affect our business.\nWe may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions, if they arise, or to refinance our outstanding debt. It is possible a large strategic acquisition would require that we issue new equity and debt securities in order to maintain our investment-grade credit rating and could result in a ratings downgrade notwithstanding our issuance of equity securities to fund the transaction. We are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets, through the interest payable on any variable-rate debt, including the interest cost on future borrowings under our credit facilities. While management believes our credit ratings will remain at a composite investment-grade level, we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels. Also, while we believe the Company will continue to have adequate credit available to meet its needs, there can be no assurance of that.\nOur Magnesia Specialties business faces currency risks from its overseas activities\nOur Magnesia Specialties business sells some of its products outside the United States. Therefore, the operations of the Magnesia Specialties business are affected from time to time by the fluctuating values of the currency exchange rates of the countries in which it does business in relation to the value of the U.S. Dollar. The business tries to mitigate the short-term effects of currency exchange rates by primarily denominating sales in the U.S. Dollar. This still leaves the business subject to certain risks, depending on the strength of the U.S. Dollar.\nUnexpected equipment failures, catastrophic events and scheduled maintenance may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns\nOur manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment, such as our kilns and finishing mills. This equipment, on occasion, may be out of service as a result of planned maintenance, failures or damage during accidents. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions. We have one- to two-week scheduled outages at least once a year to refurbish our cement and dolomitic lime production facilities. In 2020, the cement operations incurred shutdown costs of $19.7 million during the year. In 2020, the Magnesia Specialties business incurred shutdown costs of $5.1 million during the year. Any significant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage as well as cause us to lose revenue due to lost production time.\nOur paving operations present additional risks to our business\nOur paving operations face challenges when our contracts have penalties for late completion. In some instances, including many of our fixed-price contracts, we guarantee project completion by a certain date. If we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled, we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages. Under these circumstances, the total project cost could exceed our original estimate, and we could experience a loss of profit or a loss on the project. In our paving operations, we also have fixed-price and fixed-unit-price contracts where our profits can be adversely affected by a number of factors beyond our control, which can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of our original bid. These same issues and risks can also impact some of our contracts in our asphalt and ready mixed concrete operations. These risks are somewhat mitigated by the fact that a majority of our road paving contracts are projects that are short in duration.\nOur ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines have lower profit margins and operating results can be more volatile\nOur ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations typically generate lower profit margins than our aggregates and cement operations due to potentially volatile input costs, highly competitive market dynamics, and lower barriers to entry. Therefore, if we expand these operations, our consolidated gross margin would likely be adversely affected. Our overall ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations’ gross margin was 10.9% for 2020 and 10.4% for 2019.\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1A – Risk Factors\nSuppliers, Raw Materials, and Energy Costs Risk Factors\nShort supplies and high costs of fuel, energy and raw materials affect our businesses\nOur businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel, natural gas, coal, petroleum coke and other energy. The financial results of these businesses have historically been affected by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy. Changes in energy costs also affect the prices that we pay for related supplies, including explosives, conveyor belting and tires. While we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy, such as fixed-price supply contracts for coal and petroleum coke, significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results. Moreover, fluctuations in the supply and costs of these fuels and energy can make planning for our businesses more difficult. Because of the fluctuating trends in diesel fuel prices, we may enter into fixed-price fuel agreements from time to time for a portion of our diesel fuel to reduce our diesel fuel price risk.\nOur Magnesia Specialties business has fixed-price agreements for 63% of its 2021 coal, natural gas, and petroleum coke needs. The cement operations have fixed-price agreements for a portion of their 2021 coal and natural gas needs.\nCement production requires large amounts of energy, including electricity and fossil fuels. Energy costs represented approximately 21% of the 2020 direct production costs of our cement operations. Therefore, the cost of energy is one of our largest expenses. Prices for energy are subject to market forces largely beyond our control and can be quite volatile. Price increases that we are unable to pass through in the form of price increases for our products, or disruption of the uninterrupted supply of fuel and electricity, could adversely affect us. Accordingly, volatility in energy costs can adversely affect the financial results of our cement operations.\nSimilarly, our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations also require a continued supply of liquid asphalt and cement, which serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete, respectively. Some of these raw materials we produce internally, but most are purchased from third parties. These purchased raw materials are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuations, which are beyond our control. The financial results of our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these raw materials. We generally see frequent volatility in the costs for these raw materials.\nCement is sensitive to supply and price volatility\nCement competition is often based primarily on price, which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand. Prices may fluctuate significantly in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions and other market conditions, which we cannot control. When cement producers increase production capacity or more cement is imported into the market, an oversupply of cement in the market may occur if supply exceeds demand. In that case cement prices generally decline. We cannot be assured that prices for our cement products sold will not decline in the future or that such decline will not have a material adverse effect on our cement product line.\nOur Magnesia Specialties business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels\nOur Magnesia Specialties business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry. While we have reduced this risk over the last few years, this business is still dependent, in part, on the strength of the cyclical steel industry. The Magnesia Specialties business also requires significant amounts of natural gas, coal and petroleum coke, and financial results are negatively affected by increases in fuel prices or shortages.\nCyber and Information Security Risk Factors\nWe are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks\nWe are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, including reliance on third-party vendors and third-party software. Any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction or interruption of these systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. There is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption, theft of information or reputational damage as a result of a cyber-attack, such as an infiltration of a data center, or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our third-party providers. While we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and routinely test the\nPart I\n♦\nItem 1A – Risk Factors\nsecurity of our information systems network, we cannot\nensure\nthat our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business.\nOther Risk Factors\nDelays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations\nTransportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers, whether by truck, rail or water. We also rely heavily on third-party truck and rail transportation to ship coal, natural gas and other fuels to our plants. Any significant delays, disruptions or the non-availability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations. Transportation operations are subject to capacity constraints, high fuel costs and various hazards, including extreme weather conditions and slowdowns due to labor strikes and other work stoppages. In Texas, we compete for third-party trucking services with operations in the oil and gas fields, which can significantly constrain the availability of those services to us. If there are material changes in the availability or cost of transportation services, we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to transport our products or fuels at a reasonable cost, which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs.\nThe availability of railcars can also affect our ability to transport our products. Railcars can be used to transport many different types of products across all of our segments. If owners sell or lease railcars for use in other industries, we may not have enough railcars to transport our products.\nWe have long-term agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregates products from our Bahamas and Nova Scotia operations to various coastal ports. These contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options. Our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products.\nSome of our products are distributed by barges along rivers in Ohio and West Virginia. We may experience, to a lesser degree, risks associated with distributing our products by barges, including significant delays, disruptions or the non-availability of our barge transportation system that could negatively affect our operations, water levels that could affect our ability to transport our products by barge, and barges that may not be available in quantities that we might need from time to time to support our operations.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws and North Carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor\nOur restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws and North Carolina law contain provisions that may delay, deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our Board of Directors. This could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest. These provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our Board of Directors in connection with the transaction. Provisions that could delay, deter, or inhibit a future acquisition include the following:\nAdditionally, the occurrence of certain change-of-control events could result in an event of default under certain of our existing or future debt instruments."

    "text": "Part I\n♦\nItem 2 – Properties\nBuilding Materials Business\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company processed or shipped aggregates from\napproximately 300\nquarries, underground mines, and distribution yards in\n27\nstates, Canada and The Bahamas, of which\n130\nare located on land owned by the Company free of major encumbrances,\n61\nare on land owned in part and leased in part,\n91\nare on leased land, and\n14\nare on facilities neither owned nor leased, where raw materials are removed under an agreement. The Company’s aggregates reserves, on average, represent approximately 90 years at current production levels. However, certain locations may be subject to more limited reserves and may not be able to expand. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, the Company processed and shipped ready mixed concrete and asphalt products from\n128\nproperties in\nthree\nstates, of which\n100\nare located on land owned by the Company free of major encumbrances, two are on land owned in part and leased in part, two are at facilities neither owned nor leased and 24\nare on leased land.\nThe Company uses various drilling methods, depending on the type of aggregates, to estimate aggregates reserves that are economically mineable. The extent of drilling varies and depends on whether the location is a potential new site (greensite), an existing location, or a potential acquisition. More extensive drilling is performed for potential greensites and acquisitions, and, in rare cases, the Company may rely on existing geological data or results of prior drilling by third parties. Subsequent to drilling, selected core samples are tested for soundness, abrasion resistance, and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry. If the reserves meet the Company’s standards and are economically mineable, then they are either leased or purchased.\nThe Company estimates proven and probable reserves based on the results of drilling. Proven reserves are reserves of deposits designated using closely spaced drill data and are believed to be relatively homogenous. Proven reserves have a certainty of 85% to 90%. Probable reserves are reserves that are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes and/or assumptions about the economically mineable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties. The degree of certainty for probable reserves is 70% to 75%. In determining the amount of reserves, the Company’s policy is to exclude calculations that exceed certain depths, so for deposits such as granite, that typically continue to depths well below the ground, there may be additional deposits that are not included in the reserve calculations. The Company also deducts reserves not available due to property boundaries, set-backs, and plant configurations, as deemed appropriate when estimating reserves. The Company uses the same methods of analysis to evaluate and estimate the amount of its aggregates reserves used in the cement manufacturing process for its cement operations as it does for its aggregates operations. For additional information on the Company’s assessment of reserves, see “\n” included under Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” of this Form 10-K.\nSet forth in the tables below are the Company’s estimates of reserves of recoverable aggregates (hard rock and sand and gravel) of suitable quality for economic extraction, shown on a state-by-state basis, and the Company’s total annual production for the last three years, along with the Company’s estimate of years of production available, shown on a reportable segment-by-reportable segment basis. The number of producing quarries shown on the table includes underground mines. The Company’s reserve estimates for the last two years are shown for comparison purposes on a state-by-state basis. The changes in reserve estimates at a particular state level from year to year reflect the tonnages of reserves on locations that have been opened or closed during the year, whether by acquisition, disposition, or otherwise; production and sales in the normal course of business; additional reserve estimates or refinements of the Company’s existing reserve estimates; opening of additional reserves at existing locations; the depletion of reserves at existing locations; and other factors. The Company evaluates its reserve estimates primarily on a Company-wide, or reportable segment-by- reportable segment basis, and does not believe comparisons of changes in reserve estimates on a state-by-state basis from year to year are particularly meaningful. The Company’s estimate of reserves shown in the tables below include reserves used in the Company’s cement product line and Magnesia Specialties business.\nPart I\n♦\nItem 2 – Properties\nThe Company calculates its aggregate reserves for purposes of this table based on land that has been zoned for quarrying and land for which the Company has determined zoning is not required.\nCement\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company, through its subsidiaries, processed or shipped cement from eight properties in two states, of which six are located on land owned by the Company free of major encumbrances, one is on land that is owned in part and leased in part and one is on leased land. The Company’s cement operations have production facilities located at two\nPart I\n♦\nItem 2 – Properties\nsites in Texas: Midlothian, Texas, south of Dallas/Fort Worth;\nand\nHunter, Texas, north of San Antonio. The following table summarizes certain information about the Company’s cement manufacturing facilities at December 31,\n2020\n:\nReserves identified with the facilities shown above are contained on approximately 2,844 acres of land owned by the Company. As of December 31, 2020, the Company estimated its total proven and probable limestone reserves on such land to be approximately 682 million tons.\nThe Company’s cement manufacturing facilities include kilns, crushers, pre-heaters/calciners, coolers, finish mills and other equipment used to process limestone and other raw materials into cement, as well as equipment used to extract and transport the limestone from the adjacent quarries. These cement manufacturing facilities are served by rail and truck.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company, through its subsidiaries, also operated, directly or through third parties, six cement distribution terminals.\nMagnesia Specialties Business\nThe Magnesia Specialties business currently operates major manufacturing facilities in Manistee, Michigan, and Woodville, Ohio. Both of these facilities are owned.\nOther Properties\nThe Company’s principal corporate office, which it owns, is located in Raleigh, North Carolina. The Company owns and leases various administrative offices for its five operating business segments. The Company plans to move its principal corporate office to leased space in early 2021 and sell the owned headquarters buildings.\nCondition and Utilization\nThe Company’s principal properties, which are of varying ages and are of different construction types, are believed to be generally in good condition, are generally well maintained, and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used.\nDuring 2020, the principal properties of the aggregates operations were believed to be utilized at average productive capacities of approximately 75% and were capable of supporting a higher level of market demand. The Company adjusts its production schedules to meet volume demand for its products.\nDuring 2020, the Texas cement plants operated on average at 80% utilization. The Portland Cement Association (PCA) has projected that Texas cement consumption will increase modestly in 2021 from 2020. The cement business’ leadership, in collaboration with the aggregates and ready mixed concrete teams, have developed strategic plans regarding interplant efficiencies, as well as tactical plans addressing plant utilization and efficiency.\nThe Company’s Magnesia Specialties business expects future organic earnings growth to result from increased pricing, recovery from the impact from COVID-19, rationalization of the current assets and portfolio and/or further cost reductions. In the current operating environment, where steel utilization is between 75% and 80%, any unplanned change in costs or customers introduces volatility to the earnings of the Magnesia Specialties segment. The dolomitic lime business of the Magnesia Specialties segment operated at 73% utilization in 2020.\nPart I\n♦\nItem 3 – Legal Proceedings"

    "text": "INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW\nMartin Marietta Materials, Inc. (the Company or Martin Marietta) is a natural resource-based building materials company. The Company supplies aggregates (crushed stone, sand and gravel) through its network of approximately 300 quarries, mines and distribution yards in 27 states, Canada and The Bahamas. In the western United States, Martin Marietta also provides cement and downstream products, namely ready mixed concrete, asphalt and paving services, in markets where the Company has a leading aggregates position. Specifically, the Company has two cement plants in Texas and ready mixed concrete and asphalt operations in Texas, Colorado and Wyoming. Asphalt operations and paving services are exclusively in Colorado. The Company’s heavy-side\nbuilding materials are used in infrastructure\n, nonresidential and residential construction projects. Aggregates are also used in agricultural, utility and environmental applications and as railroad ballast. The aggregates, cement, ready mixed concrete, asphalt and paving product lines are reported collectively as the “Building Materials” business.\nAs more fully discussed in the\nConsolidated Strategic Objectives\nsection, geography is critically important for the Building Materials business. The Company conducts its Building Materials business through two reportable segments, organized by geography: East Group and West Group. The East Group, whose operations were previously reported in the Mid-America and Southeast Groups, consists of the East and Central Divisions.\nThe West Group is comprised of the Southwest and West Divisions.\nThe East Group provides aggregates products only. The\nWest Group provides\naggregates, cement\nand downstream\nproducts and services. Further, the following five states accounted for 71% of the Building Materials business 2020 total revenues: Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Iowa.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nMagnesia Specialties\nThe Company operates a Magnesia Specialties business with production facilities in Michigan and Ohio. The Magnesia Specialties business produces magnesia-based chemicals products used in industrial, agricultural and environmental applications. It also produces dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers for steel production and land stabilization. Magnesia Specialties’ products are shipped to customers worldwide.\nConsolidated Strategic Objectives\nThe Company’s strategic planning process, or\nS\ntrategic\nO\nperating\nA\nnalysis and\nR\neview (SOAR), provides the framework for execution of Martin Marietta’s long-term strategic plan. Guided by this framework and considering the cyclicality of the Building Materials business, the Company determines capital allocation priorities to maximize long-term shareholder value creation. The Company’s strategy includes ongoing evaluation of aggregates-led opportunities of scale in new domestic markets (i.e., platform acquisitions), expansion through acquisitions that complement existing operations (i.e., bolt-on acquisitions) and divestitures of assets that are not consistent with stated strategic goals. The Company finances such opportunities with the goal of preserving its financial flexibility by having a leverage ratio (consolidated debt-to-consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA) within a range of 2.0 times to 2.5 times within a reasonable time following the completion of a debt-financed transaction.\nThe Company, by purposeful design, will continue to be an aggregates-led business (aggregates product gross profit represented 68% of 2020 total consolidated gross profit) that focuses on markets with strong, underlying growth fundamentals where it can sustain or achieve a leading market position. Driven by this\nintentional approach, the Company has leading positions, defined as either #1 or #2,\nin approximately 90% of its markets. As part of its long-term strategic plan, the Company may also pursue strategic cement and targeted downstream opportunities. For Martin Marietta, strategic cement and targeted downstream operations are\nlocated in vertically-integrated markets where the Company has, or envisions, a clear path toward a leading aggregates position.\nGenerally, the Company’s building materials products are both sourced and sold locally. As a result, geography is critically important when assessing market attractiveness and growth opportunities. Attractive geographies exhibit (a) population growth and/or population density, both of which are drivers of heavy-side building materials consumption; (b) business and employment diversity, drivers of greater economic stability; and (c) a superior state financial position, a driver of public infrastructure growth and support.\nIn order to assess population growth and density, the Company focuses on the megaregions of the United States. Megaregions are large networks of metropolitan population centers covering thousands of square miles. According to\nAmerica 2050\n, a planning and policy program of the Regional Plan Association, a majority of the nation’s population and economic growth through 2050 will occur in 11 megaregions. The Company has a presence in most of the megaregions. As evidence of the successful execution of SOAR, the Company’s leading positions in the Texas Triangle and Colorado’s Front Range megaregions, its growth platform in the southern portion of the Northeast megaregion and its enhanced position in the Piedmont Atlantic megaregion, primarily in the Atlanta area, are the results of acquisitions since 2011. The Company has a legacy presence in the southeastern portion of the Great Lakes megaregion, encompassing operations in Indiana and Ohio. The megaregions and the Company’s key states are more fully discussed in the\nBuilding Materials Business’ Key Considerations\nsection.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn considering business and employment diversity, the Company focuses its geographic footprint along significant transportation corridors, particularly where land is readily available for the construction of fulfillment and/or data centers. The retail sector values transportation corridors, as logistics and distribution are critical considerations for construction supporting that industry. In addition, technology companies view these areas as attractive locations for data centers.\nAdditionally, the Company considers a state’s financial position in determining the opportunities and attractiveness of areas for expansion or development. In this assessment, the Company reviews a state’s financial health rating, issued by S&P Global Ratings and where AAA is the highest score. The Company’s top ten revenue-generating states have been evaluated and scored a financial health rating of AA or AAA. The Company also reviews the state’s ability to securing additional infrastructure funding and financing.\nIn line with the Company’s strategic objectives, management’s overall focus includes the following items:\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n2020 Performance Highlights\nAchieved Industry-Leading Safety Performance:\nAchieved Record Financial Performance:\nThe Company achieved record products and services revenues, consolidated gross profit, earnings from operations, net earnings attributable to Martin Marietta, diluted earnings per share and Adjusted EBITDA (defined in\nResults of Operations\nsection), driven by resilient customer demand and improved pricing and profitability across all product lines of the Building Materials business. The Company achieved its ninth consecutive year of growth for products and services revenues, gross profit, Adjusted EBITDA and earnings per diluted share (excluding the one-time impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (2017 Tax Act) on 2017 financial amounts). The Company’s commitment to safety and operational excellence resulted in the following financial performance (comparisons with 2019):\n•\nConsolidated total revenues of $4.73 billion compared with $4.74 billion\n•\nRecord consolidated gross profit of $1.25 billion compared with $1.18 billion, an increase of 6.3%\n•\nConsolidated selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses representing 6.5% of total revenues\n•\nNet earnings attributable to Martin Marietta of $721.0 million compared with $611.9 million, an increase of 17.8%\n•\nEarnings per diluted share of $11.54 compared with $9.74\n•\nRecord consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $1.39 billion\n•\nRecord operating cash flow of $1.05 billion\nContinued Disciplined Execution Against Capital Allocation Priorities:\n•\nDividend increase of 4% in August 2020, resulting in total annual dividends paid of $140.3 million, or $2.24 per share\n•\nRepurchased 0.2 million shares of common stock for $50.0 million\n•\nCapital investments into operations of $367 million\n•\nNet long-term debt repayment of $149 million\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nBuilding Materials Business\nThe Building Materials business serves customers in the construction marketplace. The business’ profitability is sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and cyclical swings in construction spending, which are affected by fluctuations in levels of public-sector infrastructure funding; interest rates; access to capital markets; and demographic, geographic, employment and population dynamics.\nThe heavy-side construction business, inclusive of much of the Company’s operations, is conducted outdoors. Therefore, erratic weather patterns, precipitation and other weather-related conditions, including flooding, hurricanes, snowstorms, cold temperatures and droughts, can significantly affect production schedules, shipments, costs, efficiencies and profitability. Generally, the financial results for the first and fourth quarters are subject to the impacts of\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nwinter weather, while the second and third quarters\ncan be\nsubject to the impacts of heavy precipitation. The impacts of erratic weather patterns are more fully discussed in the\nBuilding Materials Business’ Key Considerations\nsection.\nProduct Lines\nAggregates are an engineered, granular material consisting of crushed stone and sand and gravel, manufactured to specific sizes, grades and chemistry for use primarily in construction applications. The Company’s operations consist primarily of open pit quarries; however, the Company is also the largest operator of underground aggregates mines in the United States, with 14 active underground mines located in the East Group. The Company’s aggregates reserves average approximately 90 years at the 2020 annual production level.\nCement is the basic agent used to bind aggregates, sand and water in the production of ready mixed concrete. The Company has a strategic and leading cement position in the state of Texas, with production facilities in Midlothian, Texas, south of Dallas/Fort Worth, and Hunter, Texas, north of San Antonio. These two facilities produce Portland and specialty cements, have a combined annual capacity of approximately 4.5 million tons, and collectively operated at approximately 80% utilization in 2020. The Midlothian plant has a permit that allows for annual capacity expansion of 0.8 million tons. In addition to the two production facilities, the Company operates several cement distribution terminals. Calcium carbonate in the form of limestone is the principal raw material used in the production of cement. The Company owns more than 600 million tons of limestone reserves adjacent to its cement production plants.\nReady mixed concrete, a mixture primarily of cement, sand, aggregates and water, is measured in cubic yards and specifically batched or produced for customers’ construction projects and then transported and poured at the project site. The aggregates used for ready mixed concrete are a washed material with limited amounts of fines (i.e., dirt and clay). The Company operates 120 ready mix plants in Texas, Colorado and Wyoming. Asphalt is most commonly used in surfacing roads and parking lots and consists of liquid asphalt, or bitumen, the binding medium, and aggregates. Similar to ready mixed concrete, each asphalt batch is produced to customer specifications. The Company’s asphalt operations and paving services are located in Colorado. Market dynamics for these downstream product lines include a highly competitive environment and lower barriers to entry compared with the Company’s upstream product lines of aggregates and cement.\nEnd-Use Trends\n♦\nTotal value of construction put in place increased 5%\n♦\nPublic construction spending increased 5%\n♦\nPrivate nonresidential construction market spending decreased 3%\n♦\nPrivate residential construction market spending increased 12%\nThe principal end-use markets of the Building Materials business are public infrastructure (i.e., highways; streets; roads; bridges; and schools); nonresidential construction (i.e., manufacturing and distribution facilities; industrial complexes; office buildings; large retailers and wholesalers; healthcare, hospitality and energy-related activity); and residential construction (i.e., subdivision development; and single- and multi-family housing). Aggregates are also used in agricultural, utility and environmental applications and as railroad ballast, collectively comprising the ChemRock/Rail market.\nPublic infrastructure projects can require several years to complete, while residential and nonresidential construction\nprojects are\nusually completed within one year. Generally, customer purchase orders do not contain firm quantity commitments, regardless of end-use market.\nTherefore, management does\nnot utilize a Company\nbacklog in managing\nits business\n.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe public infrastructure market accounted for 3\n6\n% of the Company’s aggregates shipments in\n2020\n.\nA\nnticipated lower shipments in portions of North Carolina\n, reduced energy-sector activity and COVID-19-driven project delays\nwere primary factors for the\n1\n% shipment decline to this end use\n.\nThe\nCompany’s shipments to this end-use market remain below the most recent five-year average of 3\n8\n% and ten-year average of 4\n3\n%.\nWhile construction spending in the public and private market sectors is affected by\neconomic cycles\n, the\nhistoric level of spending on public\ninfrastructure projects has been comparatively more stable due to the predictability of funding from federal, state and local governments, with approximately half of the funding from federal government and half from state and local governments. The\nFixing America’s Surface Transportation Act\n(FAST Act), signed into law on December 4, 2015, authorized $305 billion over fiscal years 2016 through 2020 and was subsequently extended for one year, providing an additional $13.6 billion to the Highway Trust Fund.\nPublic construction projects, once awarded, are typically seen through to completion. Thus, delays from weather or other factors can serve to extend the duration of the construction cycle. State and local initiatives that support infrastructure funding, including gas tax increases and other ballot initiatives, are increasing in size and number as these governments recognize the need to play an expanded role in public infrastructure funding. In November 2020, 303 state and local ballot initiatives, or 94% of all infrastructure funding measures up for vote, were approved. That set a 20-year approval rating record. The approved infrastructure initiatives are estimated to generate nearly $14 billion in one-time and recurring revenues, with initiatives in Texas accounting for over $11 billion of this total.\nThe nonresidential construction market accounted for 34% of the Company’s aggregates shipments in 2020. Following strong activity in 2019, aggregates shipments to this end use decreased 9%, reflecting reduced energy-sector activity from low oil prices and the completion of certain windfarm and a pause in some liquefied natural gas projects. The Dodge Momentum Index, a twelve-month leading indicator of construction spending for nonresidential building compiled by McGraw-Hill Construction and where the year 2000 serves as an index basis of 100, was 134.6 in December 2020. While down 5% compared with December 2019, the index increased 9% from November 2020 to December 2020, suggesting positive momentum in the nonresidential construction sector at the onset of 2021.\nThe residential construction market accounted for 24% of the Company’s aggregates shipments in 2020, and increased 6% compared with 2019. This end use is interest rate sensitive and typically moves in direct correlation with economic cycles. The Company’s exposure to residential construction is split between aggregates used in the construction of subdivisions (including roads, sidewalks, utilities and storm and sewage drainage), aggregates used in new single-family home construction and aggregates used in construction of multi-family units. Construction of both subdivisions and single-family homes is nearly three times more aggregates intensive than construction of multi-family units. Through an economic cycle, multi-family construction generally begins early in the cycle and then transitions to single-family construction. Therefore, the timing of new subdivision starts, as well as new single-family housing permits, are strong indicators of residential volumes. Residential housing starts of 1.4 million units for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased 7% compared with 2019, but remain below the 50-year historical annual average of 1.5 million units. For the year ended December 31, 2020, national housing permits increased 5% versus 2019. The Company expects continued growth in the residential market driven by\nundersupply, low interest rates, favorable demographics, job growth, deurbanization, land availability and efficient permitting.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe remaining\n6\n% of the Company’s\n2020\naggregates shipments was to the ChemRock/Rail market, which includes\nballast and agricultural limestone. Ballast is an aggregates product\nused to stabilize railroad track beds and, increasingly, concrete rail\nties are being used as a substitute for wooden ties. Agricultural lime, a high-calcium carbonate material, is used as a supplement in animal feed, a soil acidity neutralizer and agricultural growth enhancer. Additionally, ChemRock/Rail includes rip rap, which is used as a stabilizing material to control\nerosion caused by water runoff at embankments, ocean beaches, inlets, rivers and streams, and high-calcium limestone, which is used as filler in glass, plastic, paint, rubber, adhesives, grease and paper. Chemical-grade, high-calcium limestone is used as a desulfurization material in utility plants.\nPricing Trends\nMaterials pricing for construction projects is generally based on terms committing to the availability of specified products of a stated quantity at an agreed-upon price during a definitive period. Since infrastructure projects span multiple years, announced price changes can have a lag time before taking effect while the Company sells products under existing price agreements. Pricing escalators included in multi-year infrastructure contracts serve to somewhat mitigate this effect. However, during periods of sharp or rapid increases in production costs, multi-year infrastructure contract pricing may provide only nominal pricing growth. Additionally, the Company may implement mid-year price increases, on a market-by-market basis, where appropriate. Pricing is determined locally and is affected by supply and demand characteristics of the local market.\nOn a mix-adjusted basis, which is discussed further in the\nResults of Operations\nsection, 2020 aggregates pricing improved by 4.0% and 2020 cement pricing increased 3.2%.\nCost Structure\nDirect production costs for the Building Materials business are components of cost of revenues incurred at the quarries, mines, cement plants, ready mixed concrete plants, asphalt plants and paving operations and distribution yards and facilities. Cost of revenues also includes the cost of resale materials, freight expenses to transport materials from a producing quarry or cement plant to a distribution yard or facility and production overhead costs.\nGenerally, the significant components of direct production costs for the Building Materials business are (1) labor and related benefits; (2) raw materials; (3) depreciation, depletion and amortization (DDA); (4) repairs and maintenance; (5) contract\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nservices\n; (6)\nsupplies\n; and (7)\nenergy\n. In\n2020\n, these categories represented 9\n0\n% of the Building Materials business’ total\ndirect\nproduction costs.\nProduction is the key driver in determining the levels of variable costs, as it affects the number of hourly employees and related labor hours. Further, components of energy, supplies and repairs and maintenance costs also increase in connection with higher production volumes. Variable costs are expenses that fluctuate with the level of production volume, while fixed costs are expenses that do not vary based on production or sales volume. Accordingly, the Company’s operating leverage can be substantial.\nGenerally, when the Company invests capital in facilities and equipment, increased capacity and productivity, along with reduced labor and repair costs, can offset increased fixed depreciation costs. However, the increased productivity and related efficiencies may not be fully realized in a lower-demand environment, resulting in under absorption of fixed costs.\nWage and benefit inflation and increases in labor costs may be somewhat mitigated by enhanced productivity in an expanding economy. Further, workforce reductions resulting from process automation and mobile fleet right-sizing, primarily in the aggregates operations, have mitigated rising labor costs. During economic downturns, the Company reviews its operations and, where practical, temporarily idles certain sites. The Company is able to serve these markets with other open facilities that are in close proximity. In certain markets, management can create production “super crews” that work on a rotating basis at various locations within a district. For example, within a market, a crew may work three days per week at one quarry and the other two workdays at another quarry. This has allowed the Company to responsibly manage headcount in periods of lower demand.\nThe production of ready mixed concrete and asphalt requires the use of cement and liquid asphalt raw materials, respectively. Therefore, fluctuations in prices for these raw materials directly affect the Company’s operating results.\nCement production is a capital-intensive operation with high fixed costs to run plants that operate continuously with the exception of maintenance shutdowns. Kiln and finishing mill maintenance typically requires a plant to be shut down for a period of time as repairs are made. In 2020 and 2019, the cement operations incurred outage costs of $19.7 million and $26.3 million, respectively. The decrease in outage costs in 2020 compared with 2019 is primarily attributable to improved kiln reliability resulting from prior-period investments and the timing of planned kiln outages. The Company adjusts production levels in anticipation of planned maintenance shutdowns.\nTypically, diesel fuel represents the single largest component of energy costs for the Building Materials business. The average cost per gallon was $1.49 and $2.08 in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in energy costs also affect the prices that the Company pays for related supplies, including explosives, conveyor belting and tires. Further, the Company’s contracts of affreightment for shipping products on its rail and waterborne distribution network typically include provisions for escalations or reductions in the amounts paid by the Company if the price of fuel moves outside a stated range.\nThe impact of inflation on the Company’s businesses has not been significant. Further, historically, the Company has achieved pricing growth in periods of inflation based on its ability to increase its selling prices in a normal economic environment.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBuilding Materials Business’ Key Considerations\nGeography is critically important as products are sourced and sold locally\nThe Company’s geographic footprint is primarily in attractive markets with strong, underlying growth characteristics, including population growth and/or population density and business and economic diversity, both of which generate demand for construction and the Company’s Building Materials products. The Company has a presence in most of the megaregions of the United States, notably: Texas Triangle, Gulf Coast, Piedmont Atlantic, Front Range and Florida, each of which is discussed below. Additionally, Iowa is discussed below as a top five revenue-generating state and, while not part of a megaregion, is an attractive market with a diversified economy.\nTexas Triangle and Gulf Coast\nThe Texas Triangle is primarily defined by the anchoring metropolises of Dallas/Fort Worth, San Antonio and Houston.  Approximately two-thirds of Texans call the Texas Triangle home, and the three anchoring cities had an estimated population of nearly 18 million as of July 1, 2019 as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. The megaregion’s population is expected to exceed 35 million by 2050. The Texas Triangle contains the headquarters of 48 Fortune 500 companies and represents a diverse economy, including the finance, technology, transportation and goods and services sectors.\nUniquely, Houston, which has represented over 25% of Texas’ gross domestic product (GDP) for the past nineteen years, is considered part of both the Gulf Coast and the Texas Triangle megaregions. In addition to Houston, cities in the Gulf Coast megaregion include New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The Gulf Coast megaregion’s population is expected to exceed 16 million in 2025 and 23 million in 2050. The economy is driven by the energy, chemical and transportation sectors.\nThe Texas market remains one of the strongest in the United States and, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, as of September 30, 2020, the state’s GDP comprised 9% of the nation’s $19.1 trillion GDP.  In 2019, the latest ranking available,\nForbes\nrecognized Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston as the second, 20\nth\nand 34\nth\nbest metros for business and careers, respectively. Texas continues to lead the nation in population growth, and its population is estimated to increase 35% from 2020 to 2040. Houston, San Antonio and Dallas are ranked as the fourth, seventh and ninth, respectively, most populous cities in the United States as of July 1, 2019, the latest available information from the U.S. Census Bureau. Over the ten-year period ended November 2020 and as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\n,\nthe metropolitan areas of Austin, Dallas,\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSan Antonio and\nHouston\nhave experienced employment growth of\n40\n%, 2\n7\n%\n, 22%\nand\n18\n%, respectively. Supported by population growth,\nTexas\nleads the country\nin total housing permits for\nthe\nyear\nended\nDecember 31\n, 2020\n.\nThe state’s Department of Transportation (TxDOT) let $7.5 billion in construction projects in fiscal 2020 and has a letting budget of $9.5 billion for fiscal 2021 and $7.7 billion for fiscal 2022. In 2019, TxDOT announced the 2020 Unified Transportation Program, identifying planned investments totaling over $77 billion of infrastructure projects over the next ten years. Funding for highway construction comes from dedicated sources, including Propositions 1 and 7, as opposed to the use of general funds. Proposition 1, which passed in 2015, takes a portion of the oil and gas severance tax revenues and allocates them to the state highway fund. Proposition 7 is funded by state sales and use taxes and motor vehicle sales and rental taxes and is used for non-toll roads and certain transportation-related debt. For fiscal 2019 and 2020, these propositions provided $5.4 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, to the state highway fund. Additionally, in November 2020, voters approved 100% of ballot measures that will provide an additional $11.6 billion of infrastructure funding. Though the COVID-19 pandemic slowed economic advancement temporarily, construction activity is recovering, as evidenced by developers and businesses planning expansion throughout Texas.  Amazon, Hewlett Packard, Tesla and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport have announced plans for significant new projects in Austin, Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston. Further, continued federal regulatory approvals should contribute to increased heavy building materials consumption for large energy-sector projects over for the next several years.\nPiedmont Atlantic\nThe Piedmont Atlantic megaregion generally follows the Interstate 85/20 corridor, spanning across North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and Alabama, and includes four primary metropolitan areas: Raleigh-Durham, Charlotte, Atlanta and Birmingham. The Piedmont Atlantic is a fast-growing megaregion; however, it is facing challenges that accompany a growing population, including increased traffic congestion and inadequate infrastructure.\nNorth Carolina continues to demonstrate strong population trends, ranking in the top ten states for population growth for the twelve months ended July 1, 2019, the last annual estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau. North Carolina’s population is estimated to grow to 14 million by 2050. Employment growth in North Carolina has been steady and consistent. Further, in 2019,\nForbes\nranked Raleigh and Charlotte as the third and seventh best cities, respectively, for business and careers. In 2020, UPS, Grifols Therapeutics and Centene announced plans to invest more than $1.7 billion in North Carolina. The state continues to make significant infrastructure investment, with a fiscal year 2021 overall spending schedule of $5.8 billion. Additionally, since 2010, all transportation referendums totaling $1.8 billion have been approved by voters. In October 2020, the state issued $700 million of Build NC Bonds to fund transportation initiatives. The state’s 2020-2029 Statewide\nTransportation Improvement Program, or STIP, reflects investment of approximately $23.7 billion for approximately 1,700 projects\n.  In January 2021, the North Carolina Future Investment Resources for Sustainable Transportation, or NC FIRST, Commission issued an extensive report to the state’s transportation secretary, recommending an additional transportation investment need of $20 billion over the next decade.\nSouth Carolina ranked sixth in the nation for population growth for the twelve months ended July 1, 2019. The state’s infrastructure program is supported by Senate Bill 1258, also known as Act No. 275 and enacted in 2016, allowing up to $4.2 billion to be devoted to highway spending over a ten-year period. South Carolina’s ten-year department of transportation (DOT) plan includes 1,000 miles of upgrades to rural roads and improvements to 140 miles of interstate highways. To fund infrastructure needs, the state passed House Bill 3516 in June 2017, which increased the state’s gas tax $0.02 per gallon per year for six years, the state’s first gas tax increase in 30 years. The bill is expected to generate an additional $625 million per year when fully implemented. Additionally, since 2010, voters approved 78% of ballot measures for transportation funding totaling $3.6 billion. The nonresidential market will benefit from recent announcements by businesses planning to expand their operations in South Carolina, including Continental Tire, Vigilent Labs, Nephron Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Carver Maritime, LLC.  Additionally, the South Carolina Port Authority is investing $2.8 billion for improvements through 2022.\nWith nearly 3% of the nation’s GDP, Georgia continues to be a top-performing state.  According to the Georgia Department of Economic Development, the state is headquarters for 18 Fortune 500 companies and has obtained $4.3 billion in expansions and new project investments since July 1, 2020, creating almost 12,000 jobs. Georgia has consistently ranked as one of the top states for employment and population growth. For all U.S. metropolitan areas with populations greater than one million, Atlanta ranked 18\nth\nin employment gains for the ten-year period ended November 2019.  Georgia’s Major Mobility Investment Program, announced in 2017 and updated in 2019, will invest $11 billion over a ten-year period in 13 highway projects. Additionally, since 2010, Georgia voters approved more than two-thirds of ballot measures to collectively provide $7.3 billion for road and transit projects.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFront Range\nThrough strategic acquisitions since 2011, the Company has built a leading position to serve the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. Extending from the southern portion of Wyoming near Cheyenne, following Interstate 25 through Colorado into New Mexico, incorporating Santa Fe and Albuquerque, the Front Range megaregion is one of the nation’s fastest-growing megaregions. Colorado has ranked in the top eleven states for population growth each year for the ten-year period ended 2020. The Front Range represents 85% of Colorado’s population and is estimated to exceed 10 million residents by 2050, nearly double the 2010 population.\nThe Colorado economy includes a diverse economic base, leading to strong employment and population growth. Denver was ranked fourth by\nForbes\nfor best cities for business and careers in 2019. Senate Bill 17-267, enacted in 2017, includes a component focused on new lease-purchase agreements of state facilities that allocates $1.9 billion of its proceeds to Colorado DOT (CDOT) with the remainder of its proceeds to transportation and capital construction projects over a four-year period. CDOT has a spending budget of $2.3 billion for fiscal year 2020-2021.\nFlorida\nSpanning nearly the entire state, the Florida megaregion is rapidly expanding. Florida is the country’s third-most populous state according to the Census Bureau. Further, the state’s population is estimated to increase by more than seven million, or 32%, from 2020 to 2040. The state’s GDP represents 5% of the nation’s GDP.\nFlorida has a $9.2 billion DOT budget for fiscal year 2020-2021 and a five-year adopted work plan of $54.3 billion through 2025.\nIowa\nIowa has been a top-five Martin Marietta revenue-generating state for decades and has historically experienced a stable and steady economy. Iowa is the nation’s largest corn- and pork-producing state and provides approximately 9% of America’s food supply. The Company’s agricultural lime shipments are dependent on, among other things, weather, demand for agricultural commodities (including corn and soybeans), commodity prices and farm and land values. The Iowa economy has become consistently more diverse over the past several years, in part due to both its low cost and ease of doing business. The state is attractive for starting and expanding businesses due to enticing tax incentives. Facebook is in process of expanding its data center, estimated to be 3.5 million square feet when complete, and has a projected completion date in late 2022 or early 2023.  In 2020, Microsoft Corporation announced plans to build two new data centers at an estimated cost of $1 billion each, with construction expected to begin in September 2021. Additionally, Apple plans to build a $1.3 billion data center near Des Moines, with an estimated project completion date of August 2027.\nGrowth markets with limited supply of indigenous stone must be served via a long-haul distribution network\nThe U.S. Department of the Interior’s geological map of the United States depicts the possible sources of indigenous rock and illustrates its limited supply in certain areas of the United States, including the coastal areas from Virginia to Texas. Further, certain interior United States markets may experience limited availability of locally sourced aggregates resulting from increasingly restrictive zoning, permitting and/or environmental laws and regulations. The Company’s long-haul distribution network is used to supplement, or in many cases wholly supply, the local crushed stone needs of these areas.\nThe long-haul distribution network can diversify market risk for locations that engage in long-haul transportation of aggregates products. This is particularly true where a producing quarry serves a local market and transports products via rail, water and/or truck to be sold in other markets, the risk of a downturn in one market may be somewhat mitigated by other markets served by the location.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nProduct shipments are moved by rail, water and truck through the Company’s long-haul distribution network. The Company’s rail network primarily serves its Texas, Florida, Colorado and Gulf Coast markets, while the Company’s Bahamas and Nova Scotia locations transport materials via oceangoing ships. The Company’s strategic focus includes expanding inland and offshore capacity and acquiring distribution yards and port locations to offload transported material. At December 31,\n2020\n, the distribution network available to the Company consisted of\n84\nterminals.\nThe Company’s increased rail shipments has made it more reliant on railroad performance issues, including track congestion, crew and availability, the effects of adverse weather conditions and the ability to negotiate favorable railroad shipping contracts. Further, changes in the operating strategy of rail transportation providers can create operational inefficiencies and increased costs from the Company’s rail network.\nA portion of railcars and all ships of the Company’s long-haul distribution network are under short- and long-term leases, some with purchase options, and contracts of affreightment. The limited availability of water and rail transportation\nproviders, coupled with limited distribution sites, can adversely affect lease rates for such services and ultimately the freight rates.\nThe Company has long-term agreements providing dedicated shipping capacity from its Bahamas and Nova Scotia operations to its coastal ports. These contracts of affreightment are take-or-pay contracts with minimum and maximum shipping requirements. The minimum requirements were met in 2020. The Company’s waterborne contracts of affreightment have varying expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options. However, there can be no assurance that such contracts can be renewed upon expiration or that terms will continue without significant increases.\nThe multiple transportation modes that have been developed with various rail carriers and deep-water ships provide the Company with the flexibility to effectively serve customers primarily in the Southwest and Southeast coastal markets.\nPublic Infrastructure, the Company’s largest end-use market, is funded through a combination of federal, state and local sources\nTransportation investments generally boost the national economy by enhancing mobility and access and by creating jobs; priorities of many of the government’s economic plans. Public-sector construction related to transportation infrastructure can be aggregates intensive and is funded through a combination of federal, state and local sources. The federal highway bill, currently the FAST Act, provides annual funding for public-sector highway construction projects and includes spending authorizations, which represent the maximum financial obligation that will result from the immediate or future outlays of federal funds for highway and transit programs. The federal government’s surface transportation programs are funded mostly through the receipts of highway user taxes placed in the Highway Trust Fund, which is divided into the Highway Account and the Mass Transit Account. Revenues credited to the Highway Trust Fund are primarily derived from a federal gas tax, a federal tax on certain other motor fuels and interest on the accounts’ accumulated balances. Of the currently imposed federal gas tax of $0.184 per gallon, which has been static since 1993, $0.15 is allocated to the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund.\nSince most states are required to balance their budgets, reductions in revenues generally require a reduction in states’ expenditures. However, the impact of state revenue reductions on highway investment will vary depending on whether the\nmonies come from dedicated revenue sources, such as highway user fees, or whether portions are paid for with general funds.\nIn addition to federal appropriations, each state funds its infrastructure investment from specifically allocated amounts collected from various user fees, typically gasoline taxes and vehicle fees. Over the past several years, states have assumed a significantly larger role in funding infrastructure investment, including\ninitiating special-purpose taxes and raising gas taxes\n. Management believes that financing at the state and local levels, such as bond issuances, toll roads and tax initiatives, will continue to grow and have a fundamental role in advancing infrastructure projects. State infrastructure investment generally leads to increased growth opportunities for the Company. The level of state public-works spending is varied across the nation and dependent upon individual state economies. The degree to which the Company could be affected by a reduction or slowdown in infrastructure spending varies by state. The state economies of the Building Materials business’ ten largest revenue-generating states may disproportionately affect the Company’s financial performance.\nGovernmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest rate-sensitive than private-sector spending. Obligations of federal funds are a leading indicator of highway construction activity in the United States. Before a state or local DOT can solicit bids on an eligible construction project, it enters into an agreement with the Federal Highway Administration to obligate the federal government to pay its portion of the project cost. Federal obligations are subject to annual funding appropriations by Congress.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe need for surface transportation improvements continues to significantly outpace the amount of available funding. A large number of roads, highways and bridges built following the establishment of the Interstate Highway System in 1956 are now in need of major repair or reconstruction. According to The Road Information Program (TRIP), a national transportation research group, vehicle travel on United States highways increased\n25\n% from 2000 to 201\n8\n, while new lane road mileage increased only\n9\n% over the same period. TRIP also reports\nthat\npavement on 11\n% of the nation’s major roads are in poor or mediocre condition and\n27\n% of the nation’s\ninterstate\nbridges are\nin need of repair or replacement, with 3% of bridges rated poor or structurally deficient\n.\nThe\n2020\nTRIP report additionally state\nd\nan estimated backlog of $123 billion of\nimprovements to\nthe nation’s highway system\nexists\nand an increase of annual investment from $23 billion to $57 billion for the next 20 years is needed to address\nthese improvements\nand meet mobility needs.\nManagement believes\ninfrastructure\nactivity for\n202\n1\nand beyond should benefit from the FAST Act\nextension\nand its eventual successor bill\n,\nadditional state and local infrastructure initiatives and\nthe 2017 Tax Act.\nIn addition to highways and bridges, transportation infrastructure includes aviation, mass transit, and ports and waterways. Railroad construction continues to benefit from economic growth, which ultimately generates a need for additional maintenance and improvements.\nErratic weather can significantly impact operations\nProduction and shipment levels for the Building Materials business correlate with general construction activity, most of which occurs outdoors and, as a result, is affected by erratic\nweather, seasonal changes and other climate-related\nconditions which can significantly affect the business. Typically, due to a general slowdown in construction activity during winter months, the first and fourth quarters experience lower production and shipment activity. As such, temperature plays a significant role in the months of March and November, meaningfully affecting the Company’s first- and fourth-quarter\nresults, respectively, where warm and/or moderate temperatures\nin March and November allow the construction season to start earlier and end later, respectively.\nExcessive rainfall jeopardizes production efficiencies, shipments and profitability in all markets served by the Company. In particular, the Company’s operations in the southeastern and Gulf Coast regions of the United States and The Bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity, most notably in August, September and October, though the hurricane season formally starts and ends on June 1 and November 1, respectively.\nThe 2020 Atlantic hurricane season set a record with 30 named storms, of which 13 were hurricanes. To put this in perspective, the average hurricane season has 12 named storms, of which six are hurricanes. The Gulf Coast, eastern seaboard, The Bahamas and Nova Scotia were all impacted by storms in 2020.\nCapital investment decisions driven by capital intensity of the Building Materials business and focus on land\nThe Company’s organic capital program is designed to leverage construction market growth through investment in both permanent and portable facilities at the Company’s operations. Over an economic cycle, the Company typically invests organic capital at an annual level that approximates depreciation expense. At mid-cycle and through cyclical peaks, organic capital investment typically exceeds depreciation expense, as the Company supports current capacity needs and future growth. Conversely, at a cyclical trough, the Company may reduce levels of capital investment. Regardless of cycle, the Company sets a priority of investing capital to ensure safe, environmentally-sound and efficient operations, as well as to provide the highest quality of customer service and establish a foundation for future growth.\nThe Company is diligent in its focus on land opportunities, including potential new sites (greensites) and expanding locations. Land purchases are usually opportunistic and can include contiguous property around existing quarry locations. Such property can serve as buffer property or additional mineral reserve capacity, assuming regulatory hurdles can be cleared and the underlying geology supports economical aggregates mining. In either instance, the acquisition of additional property around an existing quarry typically allows the expansion of the quarry footprint and an extension of quarry life.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nMagnesia Specialties Business\nThe Magnesia Specialties business manufactures magnesia-based chemicals products for industrial, agricultural and environmental applications at its Manistee, Michigan facility. The Magnesia Specialties business produces and sells dolomitic lime from its Woodville, Ohio facility. Of 2020 total revenues, 67% were attributable to chemicals products, 32% were attributable to lime and 1% was attributable to stone.\nIn 2020, 79% of the lime produced was sold to third-party customers, while the remaining 21% was used\ninternally as a raw material for the business’ manufacturing\nof chemicals products. Dolomitic lime products sold to external customers are primarily used by the steel industry, and overall, 34% of Magnesia Specialties’ 2020 total revenues related to products used in the steel\nindustry. Accordingly, a portion of the segment’s revenues\nand\nprofits is\naffected by production\nand\ninventory\ntrends within the steel industry, which are guided by the rate of consumer consumption, the flow of offshore imports and other economic factors. Steel production was adversely affected by COVID-19, notably when domestic auto manufacturers shutdown due to the pandemic. Steel capacity utilization decreased dramatically from a high of nearly 81% in January 2020 to just below 50% in April 2020; steel capacity utilization as of December 2020 was 74%.  The dolomitic lime business runs most\nprofitably at 70% or greater steel capacity utilization; domestic capacity utilization averaged 65% in 2020. The chemical products business focuses on higher-margin specialty chemicals that can be produced at volumes that support efficient operations.\nTotal revenues of the Magnesia Specialties business in 2020 were predominantly derived from domestic customers, and no single foreign country accounted for 10% or more of the total revenues for the business. Financial results can be affected by foreign currency exchange rates, increasing transportation costs or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. To mitigate the short-term effect of currency exchange rates, foreign transactions are denominated in United States dollars.\nA significant portion of the Magnesia Specialties business’ costs is of a fixed or semi-fixed nature. The production process requires the use of natural gas, coal and petroleum coke. Therefore, fluctuations in their pricing directly affect operating results. To help mitigate this risk, the Company has fixed\n-price agreements for approximately\n63% of its 2021 energy needs for coal, natural gas, petroleum coke and electricity. For 2020, the segment’s average cost per MCF (thousand cubic feet) of natural gas decreased 9% versus 2019. Given high fixed costs, low capacity utilization can negatively affect the segment’s results of operations. Management expects future organic profitability growth to result from increased pricing, rationalization of the current product portfolio and/or further cost reductions.\nThe Magnesia Specialties business is highly dependent\non\nrail\ntransportation,\nparticularly\nfor movement of\ndolomitic\nlime from Woodville to Manistee and direct customer\nshipments of dolomitic lime and magnesia chemicals\nproducts\nfrom both Woodville and Manistee. The segment can be affected by the risks mentioned in the long-haul distribution discussion in the\nBuilding Materials Business’ Key Considerations\nsection.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nEnvironmental Regulation and Litigation\nThe expansion and growth of the aggregates industry is subject to increasing challenges from environmental and political advocates aiming to control the pace and direction of future development. Certain environmental groups have published lists of targeted municipal areas, including areas within the Company’s marketplace, for environmental and suburban growth control. The effect of these initiatives on the Company’s growth is typically localized. Further challenges are expected as the momentum of these initiatives ebb and flow across the United States. Rail and other transportation alternatives are being heralded by these special-interest groups as solutions to mitigate road traffic congestion and overcrowding.\nThe Company’s operations are subject to and affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety and other regulatory matters. Certain of the Company’s operations may occasionally use substances classified as toxic or hazardous. The Company regularly monitors and reviews its operations, procedures and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations. Despite these compliance efforts, risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of the Company’s businesses, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.\nEnvironmental operating permits are, or may be, required for certain of the Company’s operations; such permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. New permits are generally required for opening new sites or for expansion at existing operations and can take several years to obtain. In the area of land use, rezoning and special or conditional use permits are increasingly difficult to obtain. Once a permit is issued, the location is required to generally operate in accordance with the approved site plan.\nThe Clean Air Act, originally passed in 1963 and periodically updated by amendments, is the United States’ national air pollution control program that granted the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authority to set limits on the level of various air pollutants. To be in compliance with National Ambient Air Quality Standards, a defined geographic area must be below established limits for six pollutants. Environmental groups have been successful in lawsuits against the federal and certain state departments of transportation, delaying highway construction in municipal areas not in compliance with the Clean Air Act. The EPA designates geographic areas as nonattainment areas when the level of air pollutants exceeds the national standard. Nonattainment areas receive deadlines to reduce air pollutants by instituting various control strategies or otherwise face fines or control by the EPA. Included as nonattainment areas are several major metropolitan areas in the Company’s markets, such as Houston/Brazoria/Galveston, Texas; Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas; Bexar County in San Antonio-New Braunfels, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Boulder, Colorado; Fort Collins/Greeley/Loveland, Colorado; Atlanta, Georgia; and Baltimore, Maryland. Federal transportation funding has been directly tied to compliance with the Clean Air Act.\nLarge emitters (facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more per year) of greenhouse gases (GHG) must report GHG generation to comply with the EPA’s Mandatory Greenhouse Gases Reporting Rule (GHG Rule). The Company files annual reports in accordance with the GHG Rule relating to operations at its two cement plants in Texas, as well as its Magnesia Specialties facilities in Woodville, Ohio, and Manistee, Michigan, each of which emit certain GHG, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. If Congress passes legislation on GHG, these operations will likely be subject to the new program. The Company believes that any increased operating costs or taxes related to GHG emission limitations at its cement or Woodville operations would be passed on to its customers. The Manistee facility may have to absorb extra costs due to the regulation of GHG emissions in order to maintain competitive pricing in its markets. The Company cannot reasonably predict how much those increased costs may be.\nThe Company is engaged in certain legal and administrative proceedings incidental to its normal business activities. In the opinion of management, based upon currently available facts, the likelihood is remote that the ultimate outcome of any litigation or other proceedings, including those pertaining to environmental matters, relating to the Company and its subsidiaries, will have a material adverse effect on the\noverall results of the Company’s operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFINANCIAL OVERVIEW\nIn 2020, the Company achieved record products and services revenues, consolidated gross profit, consolidated earnings from operations, net earnings attributable to Martin Marietta, diluted earnings per share and consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (defined below). The Building Materials business achieved gross margin expansion of 160 basis points, with growth across all product lines. The Magnesia Specialties business experienced a continued decline in chemicals products sales as both domestic and international customer experienced a downturn in economic activity related to COVID-19.\nResults of Operations\nThe discussion and analysis that follow reflect management’s assessment of the financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) of the Company and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements. As discussed in more detail, the Company’s operating results are highly dependent upon activity within the construction marketplace, economic cycles within the public and private business sectors and seasonal and other weather-related conditions. Though the Company’s operations have been considered an essential business during stay-a-home orders in 2020, the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted markets in which the Company operates.  Accordingly, financial results for any year presented, or year-to-year comparisons of reported results, may not be indicative of future operating results. As permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the FAST Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K, the Company has elected to omit the discussion of the earliest period (2018) presented as it was included in its MD&A in its 2019 Form 10-K filed on February 21, 2020, incorporated by reference from\n” thereto.\nThe Company’s Building Materials business generated the majority of consolidated total revenues and earnings from operations. The following comparative analysis and discussion should be read within this context. Further, sensitivity analysis and certain other data are provided to enhance the reader’s understanding of MD&A and are not intended to be indicative of management’s judgment of materiality.\nThe Company’s consolidated operating results and operating results as a percentage of total revenues are as follows:\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA\nEarnings before interest; income taxes; depreciation, depletion and amortization; and the earnings/loss from nonconsolidated equity affiliates (Adjusted EBITDA) is an indicator used by the Company and investors to evaluate the Company’s operating performance from period to period. Adjusted EBITDA is not defined by generally accepted accounting\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nprinciples and, as such, should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings\nattributable to Martin Marietta\n, earnings\nfrom operations\nor operating cash flow.\nHowever, the Company’s m\nanagement\nbelieves that Adjusted\nEBITDA\nmay provide additional information with respect to the Company’s performance.\nSince\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and may vary among companies, Adjusted EBITDA as presented by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies\n.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net earnings attributable to Martin Marietta to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA:\nMixed-Adjusted Average Selling Price\nMix-adjusted average selling price (mix-adjusted ASP) is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the impacts of period-over-period product, geographic and other mix on the average selling price.  Mix-adjusted ASP is calculated by comparing current-period shipments to like-for-like shipments in the comparable prior period.  Management uses this metric to evaluate the realization of pricing increases and believes this information is useful to investors.  The following reconciles reported average selling price to mix-adjusted ASP and corresponding variances.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAdjusted Ready Mixed Concrete Volume Variance\nThe following table presents ready mixed concrete shipment data and volume variances excluding four ready mixed concrete operations acquired in the third quarter of 2020 and excluding shipments from the Arkansas, Louisiana and eastern Texas ready mix business (ArkLaTex business) that was divested in January 2020 during the period of Martin Marietta's ownership to provide a more comparable analysis of ready mixed concrete volume variance:\nTotal Revenues\nThe following table presents revenues data for the Company and its reportable segments by product line for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nPrior-year segment information has been reclassified to conform to changes to the reportable segments effective January 1, 2020 and July 1, 2020 (see Note A to the audited consolidated financial statements).\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGross Profit\nThe following table presents gross profit and gross margin data for the Company and its reportable segments by product line for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nPrior-year segment information has been reclassified to conform to changes to the reportable segments effective January 1, 2020 and July 1, 2020 (see Note A to the audited consolidated financial statements).\nThe following presents a rollforward of the Company’s consolidated gross profit:\nThe increase in Building Materials business gross profit in 2020 compared with 2019 is primarily attributable to increased pricing, effective cost management, and lower energy and cement maintenance costs. The decline in gross profit in Magnesia Specialties is driven by lower sales due to the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. steel industry and inventory rationalization by international customers during the first portion of 2020, partially offset by cost reduction actions.\nCorporate gross profit includes intercompany royalty and rental revenue and expenses, depreciation and unallocated operational expenses excluded from the Company’s evaluation of business segment performance.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nAggregates.\nThe average selling price per ton for aggregates was $\n14.\n77\nand\n$1\n4.33\nfor\n2020\nand\n2019\n, respectively.\nAggregates average selling price increases compared to the prior year are as follows:\nThe following presents aggregates shipments for each reportable segment of the Building Materials business:\nAggregates shipments sold to external customers and internal tons used in other product lines are as follows:\n.\nAggregates volume variance compared to the prior year by reportable segment is as follows:\n1\nTotal aggregates operations include acquisitions from the date of acquisition and divestitures through the date of disposal.\nAggregates pricing improved 3.1% compared with 2019, with the West Group reporting a modest increase of 1.7%, reflecting lower percentage of higher-priced commercial rail-shipped volumes in Texas that offset robust underlying pricing gains. On a mix-adjusted basis, the West Group pricing increase was 3.9%.  Aggregates volume declined in 2020, reflecting the broad economic impact from COVID-19, lower anticipated infrastructure shipments in North Carolina and reduced energy-sector shipments resulting from completed projects that were not immediately replaced.\nCement, Ready Mixed Concrete, Asphalt and Paving Services.\nThe Company’s cement and downstream operations, namely ready mixed concrete, asphalt and paving services, are located in the West Group.\nAverage selling prices for cement, ready mixed concrete and asphalt are as follows:\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nUnit shipments for cement, ready mixed concrete and asphalt are as follows:\nCement shipments increased 2.4% in 2020 versus prior year, reflective of strong demand in North and South Texas, partially offset by reduced energy-sector demand.  Cement pricing improved 1.0% compared with the prior year, with strength in North Texas, Houston and portions of Central Texas offset by lower sales of higher-priced oil-well specialty cement products into West Texas. On a mix-adjusted basis, cement pricing increased 3.2%. Cement product gross margin expanded 510 basis points driven by improved kiln reliability resulting from prior-period investments, lower fuel costs and the timing of planned kiln outages.\nReady mixed concrete pricing improved 2.0% and adjusted shipment volume increased 3.2% in 2020, after excluding shipments from ready mixed concrete operations acquired in the third quarter of 2020 and also excluding 2019 shipments from the Southwest Division’s ArkLaTex business that was divested in January 2020.  In 2020, asphalt pricing increased 2.7% and volumes improved 15.3%, attributable to strong customer demand and favorable weather compared with the prior year.\nMagnesia Specialties.\nIn 2020, Magnesia Specialties reported total revenues of $242.7 million, gross profit of $85.5 million and earnings from operations of $70.7 million, representing decreases of 11%, 10% and 15%, respectively, compared with 2019. The declines in 2020 compared with prior year are primarily attributable to lower lime and periclase shipments to the steel industry in response to COVID-19-induced shutdown of domestic auto manufacturers. Additionally, the business experienced a continued decline in chemicals products sales as both domestic and international customers experienced a downturn in economic activity related to COVID-19. Effective cost control contributed to product gross margin expansion of 80 basis points to 40.6%.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses for 2020 and 2019 were 6.5% and 6.4% of total revenues, respectively. The $3.2 million increase in total expense reflected higher personnel costs and $6.0 million in COVID-19 related expenses primarily for cleaning and sanitizing protocols across the Company’s operations, and were partially offset by reductions in other discretionary costs.\nOther Operating Income, Net\nOther operating income, net, is comprised generally of gains and losses on the sale of assets; recoveries and losses related to certain customer accounts receivable; rental, royalty and services income; accretion expense, depreciation expense and gains and losses related to asset retirement obligations. These net amounts represented income of $59.8 million in 2020 and $9.1 million in 2019. The 2020 amount included $69.9 million of nonrecurring gains on the sales of investment land and divested assets in Austin, Texas; Riverside, California; and Augusta, Kansas. These asset sales collectively generated net cash proceeds of $122.8 million. These gains were recorded in the West Group.  The 2019 amount included the reversal of $6.9 million of accruals for sales tax and unclaimed property contingencies.\nEarnings from Operations\nConsolidated earnings from operations were $1.0 billion and $884.9 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $118.1 million in 2020 and $129.3 million in 2019. The decrease reflects lower average outstanding debt during 2020 compared with 2019 and lower interest rates on variable-rate debt.\nOther Nonoperating (Income) and Expenses, Net\nOther nonoperating income and expenses, net, is comprised generally of interest income; foreign currency transaction gains and losses; pension and postretirement benefit cost (excluding service cost); net equity earnings from nonconsolidated investments and other miscellaneous income and expenses. Consolidated other nonoperating income and expenses, net, was income of $2.0 million in 2020, and an expense of $7.3 million in 2019. The 2020 amount reflected lower pension expense of $8.1 million compared with the prior year and an expense of $11.4 million to finance third-party railroad track maintenance. 2019 expense included the correction of a prior-period error that overstated equity earnings from a nonconsolidated affiliate. The error was deemed immaterial to any previously-reported period and was corrected as an out-of-period expense of $15.7 million ($12.0 million, net of tax). The pretax noncash adjustment was recorded in other nonoperating expenses, net, consistent with the recurring classification of equity earnings from the affiliate.\nIncome Tax Expense\nVariances in the estimated effective income tax rates, when compared with the statutory corporate income tax rate, are due primarily to the statutory depletion deduction for mineral reserves, the effect of state income taxes, stock compensation deductions, and the impact of foreign income or losses for which no tax expense or benefit is recognized. Additionally, certain acquisition-related expenses have limited deductibility for income tax purposes.\nThe permanent benefit associated with the statutory depletion deduction for mineral reserves is typically the significant driver of the estimated effective income tax rate. The statutory depletion deduction is calculated as a percentage of revenues subject to certain limitations. Due to these limitations, changes in sales volumes and pretax earnings may not proportionately affect the statutory depletion deduction and the corresponding impact on the effective income tax rate. However, the impact\nof the depletion deduction on the estimated effective tax rate is inversely affected by increases or decreases in pretax earnings.\nThe Company’s estimated effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 18.9% and 18.2%, respectively.\nThe effective income tax rate for 2020 included a $14.2 million discrete benefit from financing third-party railroad track maintenance.  In exchange, the Company received a federal income tax credit and deduction.  The 2019 income tax rate reflected a discrete income tax benefit of $15.2 million related to a change in tax status of a subsidiary.\nNet Earnings Attributable to Martin Marietta and Earnings Per Diluted Share\nNet earnings attributable to Martin Marietta were $721.0 million, or $11.54 per diluted share, for 2020 and $611.9 million, or $9.74 per diluted share, for 2019.\nLiquidity and Cash Flows\nOperating Activities\nGenerally, the Company’s primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operating activities. Operating cash flow is substantially derived from consolidated net earnings, before deducting depreciation, depletion and amortization, and offset by working capital requirements. Cash provided by operations was $1.05 billion in 2020 and $966.1 million in 2019. The primary driver of the increase in cash provided by operations in 2020 is higher earnings.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization expense were as follows:\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities was $409.7 million in 2020 and $385.9 million in 2019.\nCash paid for property, plant and equipment additions was $359.7 million in 2020 and $393.5 million in 2019, the reduction reflecting the Company’s decision to reduce capital expenditures in light of COVID-19.\nThe Company paid cash of $65.1 million for acquisitions in 2020. There were no acquisitions in 2019.\nPretax proceeds from divestitures and sales of nonoperating land and equipment were $142.3 million in 2020 and $8.4 million in 2019. In 2020, the amount included the divestitures of investment land and assets in Austin, Texas; Riverside, California; and Augusta, Kansas.\nDuring 2020, the Company repaid $112.3 million of loans against company-owned life insurance policies.\nFinancing Activities\nThe Company used $357.0 million and $604.1 million of cash for financing activities during 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNet repayments of long-term debt were $149.0 million in 2020 and $350.1 million in 2019.\nThe Company repurchased 0.2 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of $50.0 million, or $237.40 per share, in 2020 and 0.4 million shares of its common stock for a total cost of $98.2 million, or $236.04 per share, in 2019.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Board of Directors approved total cash dividends on the Company’s common stock of $2.24 per share and $2.06 per share, respectively. Total cash dividends paid were $140.3 million in 2020 and $129.8 million in 2019.\nCash provided by issuances of common stock, which represents the exercises of stock options, excluding the impact of shares withheld for taxes, was $2.3 million and $13.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCapital Structure and Resources\nLong-term debt, including current maturities, was $2.63 billion at December 31, 2020, and was principally in the form of publicly-issued long-term notes and debentures.\nOn March 5, 2020, the Company issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.500% Senior Notes due 2030 (the 2.500% Senior Notes). The 2.500% Senior Notes are carried net of original issue discount, which is being amortized by the effective interest method over the life of the issue. The 2.500% Senior Notes are redeemable prior to December 15, 2029 at their make-whole redemption price at a discount rate of the U.S. Treasury Rate plus 30 basis points, or on or after December 15, 2029 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of $300.0 million of floating rate senior notes at maturity in May 2020.\nThe Company, through\na wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary,\nhas a $400.0 million\ntrade receivable securitization facility (the Trade Receivable Facility)\n. In September 2020, the Company\nextended the maturity of the Trade Receivable Facility to September 22, 2021.\nThe Trade Receivable Facility is backed by eligible trade receivables, as defined. Borrowings are limited to the lesser of the facility limit or the borrowing base, as defined\n. These receivables are originated by the Company and then sold to the wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary.\nThe Company con\ntinues to be responsible for the servicing and administration of the receivables purchased by\nthe wholly-owned special-purpose\nsubsidiary\n.\nThe Trade Receivable Facility contains a cross-default provision to the Company’s other debt agreements.\nThe $700.0 million five-year senior unsecured revolving facility (the Revolving Facility), which matures in December 2024, requires the Company’s ratio of consolidated net debt-to-consolidated EBITDA, as defined, for the trailing-twelve month period (the Ratio) to not exceed 3.50x as of the end of any fiscal quarter, provided that the Company may exclude from the Ratio debt incurred in connection with certain acquisitions during the quarter or the three preceding quarters so long as the Ratio calculated without such exclusion does not exceed 3.75x. Additionally, if there are no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility and the Trade Receivable Facility, consolidated debt, including debt for which the Company is a co-borrower, shall be reduced by the Company’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of $50.0 million, such reduction not to exceed $200.0 million, for purposes of the covenant calculation.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company’s ratio of consolidated net debt-to-consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the agreement governing the Revolving Facility (the Credit Agreement), for the trailing twelve-month EBITDA was 1.75 times and was calculated as follows:\nTotal equity was $5.89 billion at December 31, 2020. At that date, the Company had an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $158.4 million, primarily resulting from unrecognized actuarial losses related to pension benefits.\nPursuant to authority granted by its Board of Directors, the Company can repurchase up to 20 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 13.5 million shares remaining under the repurchase authorization. Future\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nshare repurchases are at the discretion of management and were temporarily paused in March 2020 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Management may resume share repurchases as circumstances dictate.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had $207.3 million in unrestricted cash and short-term investments that are considered cash equivalents. The Company manages its cash and cash equivalents to ensure short-term operating cash needs are met and excess funds are managed efficiently. The Company funds shortages in operating cash through credit facilities. The Company utilizes excess cash to either pay-down credit facility borrowings or invest in money market funds, money market demand deposit accounts or offshore time deposit accounts. Money market demand deposits and offshore time deposit accounts are exposed to bank solvency risk. Money market demand deposit accounts are FDIC insured up to $250,000. The Company’s investments in bank funds generally exceed the FDIC insurance limit.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had restricted cash of $97.1 million for the purchase of like-kind exchange replacement assets under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 1031). In January 2021, unused funds of $47.2 million were transferred to unrestricted cash and can subsequently be used for general corporate purposes. The Company has until March 9, 2021 to utilize additional funds for like-kind exchange replacement assets.  Any remaining unused funds will be transferred to unrestricted cash at that time.\nCash on hand, along with the Company’s projected internal cash flows and availability of financing resources, including its access to debt and equity capital markets, is expected to continue to be sufficient to provide the capital resources necessary to support anticipated operating needs, cover debt service requirements, meet capital expenditures and discretionary investment needs, fund certain acquisition opportunities that may arise and allow for payment of dividends for the foreseeable future. Borrowings under the Revolving Facility are unsecured and may be used for general corporate purposes. The Company’s ability to borrow or issue securities is dependent upon, among other things, prevailing economic, financial and market conditions. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $1.1 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its Revolving Facility and Trade Receivable Facility.\nThe Company may be required to obtain additional financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions or to refinance outstanding debt. Any strategic acquisition of size would likely require an appropriate balance of newly-issued equity with debt in order to maintain a composite investment-grade credit rating.  The Company is exposed to credit markets through the interest cost related to borrowings under its Revolving Facility and Trade Receivable Facility.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was signed into law in March 2020 and provides liquidity support for businesses.  The CARES Act allowed the Company to defer the payment of the 6.2% employer share of Social Security taxes for the period from March 27, 2020 through December 31, 2020.  Half of the deferred obligation will be due December 31, 2021 and the remaining half will be due December 31, 2022.  There will be no interest assessed on amounts deferred.  The Company deferred payment of $27.6 million under this provision.\nContractual and Off Balance Sheet Obligations\nPostretirement medical benefits will be paid from the Company’s assets. The obligation, if any, for retiree medical payments is subject to the terms of the plan. At December 31, 2020, the Company’s recorded benefit obligation related to these benefits totaled $12.6 million.\nThe Company has other retirement benefits related to pension plans. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of the qualified pension plans’ assets exceeded the projected benefit obligation by $41.8 million. The Company estimates that it will make contributions of $75.1 million to qualified pension plans in 2021. Any contributions beyond 2021 are currently undeterminable and will depend on the investment return on the related pension assets. However, management’s practice is to fund at least the service cost annually. At December 31, 2020, the Company had a total obligation of $115.8 million related to unfunded nonqualified pension plans and expects to make contributions of $7.5 million to these plans in 2021.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had $8.4 million accrued for uncertain tax positions, including interest and correlative effects of $0.2 million. Such liabilities may become payable if the tax positions are not sustained upon examination by a taxing authority.\nIn connection with normal, ongoing operations, the Company enters into market-rate leases for property, plant and equipment and royalty commitments principally associated with leased land and mineral reserves. Additionally, the Company enters into equipment rentals to meet shorter-term, nonrecurring and intermittent needs. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $459.0 million in operating lease obligations and $24.5 million in finance lease obligations, representing the present value of future payments. The imputed interest on operating and finance lease obligations was $174.3 million. Management anticipates that, in the ordinary course of business, the Company will enter into additional royalty agreements\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nfor land and mineral reserves during\n202\n1\n.\nAs permitted, short-term leases are excluded from ASC 842 requirements\nand\nfuture noncancelable obligations for these leases as of December 31, 20\n20\nare immaterial\n.\nAs of December 31, 2020, interest payable on the Company’s publicly traded debt through the various maturity dates was $1.35 billion.  The Company has obligations related to contracts of affreightment not accounted for as a lease and royalty agreements totaling $120.2 million and $119.7 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. The Company has purchase commitments for property, plant and equipment of $102.8 million as of December 31, 2020. The Company also has other purchase obligations related to energy and service contracts which totaled $122.4 million as of December 31, 2020.\nContingent Liabilities and Commitments\nThe Company has entered into standby letter of credit agreements relating to certain insurance claims, contract performance and permit requirements. At December 31, 2020, the Company had contingent liabilities guaranteeing its own performance under these outstanding letters of credit of $32.0 million.\nIn the normal course of business, at December 31, 2020, the Company was contingently liable for $390.2 million in surety bonds, which guarantee its own performance and are required by certain states and municipalities and their related agencies. The Company has indemnified the underwriting insurance companies against any exposure under the surety bonds. In the Company’s past experience, no material claims have been made against these financial instruments.\nThe Company is a co-borrower with an unconsolidated affiliate for a $12.5 million revolving line of credit agreement with Truist Bank. The affiliate has agreed to reimburse and indemnify the Company for any payments and expenses the Company may incur from this agreement. The Company holds a lien on the affiliate’s membership interest in a joint venture as collateral for payment under the revolving line of credit.\nOther Financial Information\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company’s audited consolidated financial statements include certain critical estimates regarding the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates require management’s subjective and complex judgments. Amounts reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements could differ materially if management used different assumptions in making these estimates, resulting in actual results differing from those estimates. Methodologies used and assumptions selected by management in making these estimates, as well as the related disclosures, have been reviewed by and discussed with the Company’s Audit Committee. Management’s determination of the critical nature of accounting estimates and judgments may change from time to time depending on facts and circumstances that management cannot currently predict.\nImpairment Review of Goodwill\nGoodwill is required to be tested annually for impairment. An interim review is performed between annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The impairment review of goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because goodwill represented 23% of the Company’s total assets at December 31, 2020; the review requires management to apply judgment and make key assumptions; and an impairment charge could be material to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. The Company performs its impairment evaluation as of October 1, which represents the annual evaluation date.\nThe Company’s reporting units, which represent the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment, are based on the operating segments of the Building Materials business. The Southwest Division is the most significant reporting unit and includes $1.7 billion of the Company’s goodwill. There is no goodwill related to the Magnesia Specialties business.\nCertain of the aforementioned reporting units within the Building Materials business meet the aggregation criteria and are consolidated into reportable segments for financial reporting.\nGoodwill is assigned to the respective reporting unit(s) based on the location of acquisitions at the time of consummation. If subsequent organizational changes result in operations being transferred to a different reporting unit, a proportionate amount of goodwill is transferred from the former to the new reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value, which represents a Step-1 analysis. However, prior to Step 1, the Company may perform an optional qualitative assessment, or Step 0. As part of the qualitative assessment, the Company considers, among other things, the following events and circumstances: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other business or reporting unit-specific events. If the Company concludes it is\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nmore-likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that a reporting unit’s fair value is higher than its carrying value, the Company does not perform any further goodwill impairment testing for that reporting unit. Otherwise, it proceeds to Step 1 of its goodwill impairment analysis. The Company may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly with the quantitative calculation in Step 1. When the Company validates its conclusion by measuring fair value, it may resume performing a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit in any subsequent period. If the reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value, no further calculation is necessary. A reporting unit with a carrying value in excess of its fair value constitutes a Step\n-\n1 failure and\nresults in an\nimpairment charge.\nFor the 2020 annual impairment evaluation, the Company performed a Step-0 analysis for all reporting units and concluded that it is more-likely-than-not that the reporting units’ fair values exceed their carrying values.\nAny potential impairment charges from future evaluations represent a risk to the Company.\nPension Benefit Obligation and Pension Expense – Selection of Assumptions\nThe Company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees and a Supplemental Excess Retirement Plan (SERP) for certain retirees (see Note K to the consolidated financial statements). Annually, as of December 31, management remeasures the defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation based on the present value of the projected future benefit payments to all participants for services rendered to date, reflecting\nexpected future pay increases through the participants’ expected retirement dates. A discount rate assumption is selected annually based on corporate bond rates as of the measurement date to calculate the present value of the projected benefit obligation.\nAnnual pension expense, referred to as net periodic benefit cost within the consolidated financial statements, (inclusive of SERP expense) consists of several components:\nThese components are calculated annually to determine the annual pension expense.\nManagement believes the selection of assumptions related to the annual pension expense and related projected benefit obligation is a critical accounting estimate due to the high degree of volatility in the expense and obligation dependent on selected assumptions. The key assumptions are as follows:\nManagement’s selection of the discount rate is based on an analysis that estimates the current rate of return for high-quality, fixed-income investments with maturities matching the payment of pension benefits that could be purchased to settle the obligations. The Company selected a hypothetical portfolio of Moody’s Aa bonds,\nwith maturities that match the benefit\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nobligations,\nto determine the discount rate. At\nDecember 31, 20\n20\n, the Company selected a discount rate assumption of\n3.\n1\n6\n%, a\n53\n-basis-point\nde\ncrease\ncompared with\nthe prior-year assumption. Of the four key assumptions, the discount rate is generally the most volatile and sensitive estimate. Accordingly, a change in this assumption has the most significant impact on the annual pension expense\nand\nthe\nprojected benefit obligation\n.\nManagement’s selection of the rate of increase in future compensation levels, which reflects cost of living adjustments and merit and promotion increases, is generally based on the Company’s historical increases in pensionable earnings, while giving consideration to any future expectations. A higher rate of increase results in higher pension expense and a higher projected benefit obligation. The assumed long-term rate of increase is 4.5%.\nManagement’s selection of the expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets is based on a building-block approach, whereby the components are weighted based on the allocation of pension plan assets. Based on the currently projected returns on these assets and related expenses, the Company selected an expected return on assets of 6.75%, the same as the prior-year rate. The following table presents the expected return on pension assets as compared with the actual return on pension assets:\nThe difference between the expected return and the actual return on pension assets is included in actuarial gains and losses, which are amortized into annual pension expense as previously described.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company estimated the remaining lives of participants in the pension plans using the Society of Actuaries’ Pri-2012 Base Mortality Table. The no-collar table was used for salaried participants and the blue-collar table\nwas used for hourly participants, both adjusted to reflect the historical experience of the Company’s participants. The Company selected the MP-2020 and the MP-2018 scales for mortality improvement at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively\n.\nAssumptions are selected on December 31 to calculate the succeeding year’s expense. For the 2020 pension expense, assumptions selected at December 31, 2019 were as follows:\nUsing these assumptions, the pension benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019 was $977.8 million and 2020 pension expense was $36.8 million. A change in the assumptions would have had the following impact on the December 31, 2019 pension benefit obligation and the 2020 expense:\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe assumptions selected at December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nUsing these assumptions, pension benefit obligation as of December 31, 2020 was $1.11 billion and 2021 pension expense is expected to be approximately $25.9 million based on current demographics and structure of the plans. Changes in the underlying assumptions would have the following estimated impact on the obligation and expected expense:\nThe Company made pension plan contributions of $88.4 million in 2020 and $385.3 million during the five-year period ended December 31, 2020. Despite these contributions, the Company’s pension plans are underfunded (projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets) by $74.0 million at December 31, 2020. The Company’s projected benefit obligation was $1.11 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $134.1 million versus the prior year, driven by the lower discount rate. The Company expects to make pension plan and SERP contributions of $82.6 million in 2021, of which $75.0 million are voluntary.\nEstimated Effective Income Tax Rate\nThe Company uses the liability method to determine its provision for income taxes. Accordingly, the annual provision for income taxes reflects estimates of the current liability for income taxes, estimates of the tax effect of financial reporting versus tax basis differences using statutory income tax rates and management’s judgment with respect to any valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. The result is management’s estimate of the annual effective tax rate (the ETR).\nIncome for tax purposes is determined through the application of the rules and regulations under the United States Internal Revenue Code and the statutes of various foreign, state and local tax jurisdictions in which the Company conducts business. Changes in the statutory tax rates and/or tax laws in these jurisdictions can have a material effect on the ETR. The effect of these changes, if material, is recognized when the change is enacted.\nAs prescribed by these tax regulations, as well as generally accepted accounting principles, the manner in which revenues and expenses are recognized for financial reporting and income tax purposes is not always the same. Therefore, these differences between the Company’s pretax income for financial reporting purposes and the amount of taxable income for income tax purposes are treated as either temporary or permanent, depending on their nature.\nTemporary differences reflect revenues or expenses that are recognized in financial reporting in one period and taxable income in a different period. An example of a temporary difference is the use of the straight-line method of depreciation of machinery and equipment for financial reporting purposes and the use of an accelerated method for income tax purposes. Temporary differences result from differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of assets or liabilities and give rise to deferred tax assets or liabilities (i.e., future tax deductions or future taxable income). Therefore, when temporary differences occur, they are offset by a corresponding change in a deferred tax account. As such, total income tax expense as reported in the Company’s consolidated statements of earnings is not changed by temporary differences.\nThe Company has deferred tax liabilities, primarily for right-of-use assets, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, employee pension and postretirement benefits and partnerships and joint ventures. The deferred tax liabilities attributable to property, plant and equipment relate to accelerated depreciation and depletion methods used for income tax purposes as compared with the straight-line and units-of-production methods used for financial reporting purposes. These temporary differences will reverse over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. The deferred tax liabilities attributable to goodwill arise as a result of amortizing goodwill for income tax purposes but not for financial reporting purposes. This temporary difference reverses when goodwill is written off for financial reporting purposes, either through divestitures or an impairment\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\ncharge. The timing of such events cannot be estimated. The deferred tax liabilities attributable to employee pension and postretirement benefits relate to deductions as plans are funded for income tax purposes compared with deductions for financial reporting purposes based on accounting standards. The reversal of these differences depends on the timing of the Company’s contributions to the related benefit plans as compared to the annual expense for financial reporting purposes. The deferred tax liabilities attributable to partnerships and joint ventures relate to the difference between the tax basis of the investments in partnerships and joint ventures when compared to the basis for financial reporting purposes. The temporary difference reverses through differences recognized over\nthe\nlife of\nthe\ninvestment or through divestiture.\nThe Company has deferred tax assets, primarily for inventories, unvested stock-based compensation awards, unrecognized losses related to the funded status of the pension and postretirement benefit plans, lease liabilities, valuation reserves, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The deferred tax assets attributable to inventories and valuation reserves relate to the deduction of estimated cost reserves and various period expenses for financial reporting purposes that are deductible in a later period for income tax purposes. The reversal of these differences depends on facts and circumstances, including the timing of deduction for income tax purposes for reserves previously established and the establishment of additional reserves for financial reporting purposes. The deferred tax assets attributable to unvested stock-based compensation awards relate to differences in the timing of deductibility for financial reporting purposes versus income tax purposes. For financial reporting purposes, the fair value of the awards is deducted ratably over the requisite service period. For income tax purposes, no deduction is allowed until the award is vested or no longer subject to substantial risk of forfeiture. The Company reflects all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in income tax expense as a discrete event in the period in which the award vests or settles, increasing volatility in the income tax rate from period to period.\nBusiness Combinations – Allocation of Purchase Price\nThe Company’s Board of Directors and management regularly review strategic long-term plans, including potential investments in value-added acquisitions of related or similar businesses, which would increase the Company’s market presence and/or are related to the Company’s existing markets. When an acquisition is completed, the Company’s consolidated statements of earnings include the operating results of the acquired business starting from the date of acquisition, which is the date control is obtained. The purchase price is determined based on the fair value of assets and equity interests given to the seller and any future obligations to the seller as of the date of acquisition. The Company allocates the purchase price to the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as valued at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded for the excess of the purchase price over the net of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation is a critical accounting policy because the estimation of fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is judgmental and requires various assumptions. Further, the amounts and useful lives assigned to depreciable and amortizable assets versus amounts assigned to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are not amortized, can significantly affect the results of operations in the period of and for periods subsequent to a business combination.\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction, and, therefore, represents an exit price.  Fair value measurement assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants, considering the use of the asset that is physically possible, legally permissible, and financially feasible at the measurement date.  The Company assigns the highest level of fair value available to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the following options:\nLevel 1 fair values are used to value investments in publicly traded entities and assumed obligations for publicly traded long-term debt.\nLevel 2 fair values are typically used to value acquired receivables, inventories, machinery and equipment, land, buildings, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and accruals for payables, asset retirement obligations, environmental remediation and compliance obligations, and contingencies. Additionally, Level 2 fair values are typically used to value assumed contracts at other-than-market rates.\nLevel 3 fair values are used to value acquired mineral reserves and mineral interests produced and sold as final products, and separately-identifiable intangible assets. The fair values of mineral reserves and mineral interests are determined using an excess earnings approach, which requires management to estimate future cash flows, net of capital investments in the\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nspecific operation and contributory asset charges. The estimate of future cash flows is based on available historical information and future expectations and assumptions determined by management, but is inherently uncertain. Key assumptions in estimating future cash flows include changes in sales price, shipment volumes and production costs as well as capital needs. The present value of the projected net cash flows represents the fair value assigned to mineral reserves and mineral interests. The discount rate is a significant assumption used in the valuation model and is based on the required rate of return that a hypothetical market participant would require if purchasing the acquired business, with an adjustment for the risk of these assets not generating the projected cash flows.\nThe Company values separately-identifiable acquired intangible assets which may include, but are not limited to, permits, customer relationships, water rights and noncompetition agreements. The fair values of these assets are typically determined by an excess earnings method, a replacement cost method or, in the case of water rights, a market approach.\nThe useful lives of amortizable intangible assets and the remaining useful lives for acquired machinery and equipment have a significant impact on earnings. The selected lives are based on the expected periods that the assets will provide value to the Company subsequent to the business combination.\nThe Company may adjust the amounts recognized for a business combination during a measurement period after the acquisition date. Any such adjustments are based on the Company obtaining additional information that existed at the acquisition date regarding the assets acquired or the liabilities assumed. Measurement-period adjustments are generally recorded as increases or decreases to the goodwill recognized in the transaction. The measurement period ends once the Company has obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date, but does not extend beyond one year from the date of acquisition. Any adjustments to assets acquired or liabilities assumed beyond the measurement period are recorded through earnings.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nNet property, plant and equipment represented 50% of total assets at December 31, 2020. Accordingly, accounting for these assets represents a critical accounting policy. Useful lives of the assets can vary depending on factors, including production levels, geographic location, portability and maintenance practices. Additionally, climate and inclement weather can reduce the useful life of an asset. Historically, the Company has not recognized significant losses on the disposal or retirement of fixed assets.\nAggregates mineral reserves and mineral interests are components within the plant, property and equipment balance on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company evaluates aggregates reserves, including those used in the cement manufacturing process, in several ways, depending on the geology at a particular location and whether the location is a greensite, an acquisition or an existing operation. Greensites require an extensive drilling program before any significant investment is made in terms of time, site development or efforts to obtain appropriate zoning and permitting (see\nEnvironmental Regulation and Litigation\nsection). The depth of overburden and the quality and quantity of the aggregates reserves are significant factors in determining whether to pursue opening the site. Further, the estimated average selling price for products in a market is also a significant factor in concluding that reserves are economically mineable. If the Company’s analysis based on these factors is satisfactory, the total aggregates reserves available are calculated and a determination is made whether to open the location. Reserve evaluation at existing locations is typically performed to evaluate purchasing\nadjoining properties, for quality control, calculating overburden volumes and for mine planning. Reserve evaluation of acquisitions may require a higher degree of sampling to locate any problem areas that may exist and to verify the total reserves.\nWell-ordered subsurface sampling of the underlying deposit is basic to determining reserves at any location. This subsurface sampling usually involves one or more types of drilling, determined by the nature of the material to be sampled and the particular objective of the sampling. The Company’s objectives are to ensure that the underlying deposit meets aggregates specifications and the total reserves on site are sufficient for mining and economically recoverable. Locations underlain with hard rock deposits, such as granite and limestone, are drilled using the diamond core method, which provides the most useful and accurate samples of the deposit. Selected core samples are tested for soundness, abrasion resistance and other physical properties relevant to the aggregates industry and depend on the aggregates use. The number and depth of the holes are determined by the size of the site and the complexity of the site-specific geology. Some geological factors that may affect the number and depth of holes include faults, folds, chemical irregularities, clay pockets, thickness of formations and weathering. A typical spacing of core holes on the area to be tested is one hole for every four acres, but wider spacing may be justified if the deposit is homogeneous.\nDespite previous drilling and sampling, once accessed, the quality of reserves within a deposit can vary. Construction contracts, for the infrastructure market in particular, include specifications related to the aggregates material. If a flaw in the deposit is discovered, the aggregates material may not meet the required specifications. Although it is possible that the\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\naggregates material can still be used for non-specification uses, this can have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to serve certain customers or on the Company’s profitability. In addition, other issues can arise that limit the Company’s ability to access reserves in a particular quarry, including geological occurrences, blasting practices and zoning issues.\nLocations underlain with sand and gravel are typically drilled using the auger method, whereby a six-inch corkscrew brings up material from below the ground which is then sampled. Deposits in these locations are typically limited in thickness. Additionally, the quality and sand-to-gravel ratio of the deposit can vary both horizontally and vertically. Hole spacing at these locations is approximately one hole for every acre to ensure a representative sampling.\nThe geologist conducting the reserve evaluation makes the decision as to the number of holes and the spacing in accordance with standards and procedures established by the Company. Further, the anticipated heterogeneity of the deposit, based on U.S. geological maps, also dictates the number of holes drilled.\nThe generally accepted reserve categories for the aggregates industry and the designations the Company uses for reserve categories are summarized as follows:\nProven Reserves\n– These reserves are designated using closely spaced drill data as described above and a determination by a professional geologist that the deposit is relatively homogeneous based on the drilling results and exploration data provided in U.S. geologic maps, the U.S. Department of Agriculture soil maps, aerial photographs and/or electromagnetic, seismic or other surveys conducted by independent geotechnical engineering firms. The proven reserves that are recorded reflect reductions incurred through quarrying that result from leaving ramps, safety benches, pillars (underground) and the fines (small particles) that will be generated during processing. Proven reserves are further reduced by reserves that are under the plant and stockpile areas, as well as setbacks from neighboring property lines. The Company typically assumes a loss factor of 25%. However, the assumed loss factor at coastal operations is approximately 40% due to the nature of the material. The assumed loss factor for underground operations is 35% primarily due to pillars.\nProbable Reserves\n– These reserves are inferred utilizing fewer drill holes and/or assumptions about the economically recoverable reserves based on local geology or drill results from adjacent properties.\nThe Company’s proven and probable reserves reflect reasonable economic and operating constraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation, and also include reserves at the Company’s inactive and undeveloped sites, including some sites where permitting and zoning applications will not be filed until warranted by expected future growth. The Company has historically been successful in obtaining and maintaining appropriate zoning and permitting (see\nEnvironmental Regulation and Litigation\nsection).\nMineral reserves and mineral interests, when acquired in connection with a business combination, are valued using an excess earnings approach for the life of the proven and probable reserves.\nThe Company uses proven and probable reserves as the denominator in its units-of-production calculation to record depletion expense for its mineral reserves and mineral interests. For 2020, depletion expense was $35.9 million.\nThe Company begins capitalizing quarry development costs at a point when reserves are determined to be proven or probable, economically mineable and when demand supports investment in the market. Capitalization of these costs ceases when production commences. Capitalized quarry development costs are classified as land improvements.\nNew mining areas may be developed at existing quarries in order to access additional reserves. When this occurs, management reviews the facts and circumstances of each situation in making a determination as to the appropriateness of capitalizing or expensing the related pre-production development costs. If the additional mining location operates in a separate and distinct area of a quarry, the costs are capitalized as quarry development costs and depreciated over the life of the uncovered reserves. Further, a separate asset retirement obligation is created for additional mining areas when the liability is incurred. Once a new mining area enters the production phase, all post-production stripping costs are expensed as incurred as periodic inventory production costs.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements – Safe Harbor Provisions Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nIf you are interested in Martin Marietta stock, management recommends that, at a minimum, you read the Company’s current annual report and Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the past year. The Company’s recent proxy statement for the annual meeting of shareholders also contains important information. These and other materials that have been filed with the SEC are accessible through the Company’s website at www.martinmarietta.com and are also available at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. You may also write or call the Company’s Corporate Secretary, who will provide copies of such reports.\nInvestors are cautioned that all statements in this Annual Report that relate to the future involve risks and uncertainties, and are based on assumptions that the Company believes in good faith are reasonable but which may be materially different from actual results. These statements, which are forward-looking statements\nwithin the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of\nthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, provide the investor with the Company’s expectations or forecasts of future events.  You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts.  They may use words such as “anticipate,” “may,” “expect,” “should,” “believe,” “project,” “intend,” “will,” and other words of similar meaning in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance.  In addition to the statements included in this report, we may from time to time make other oral or written forward-looking statements in other filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or in other public disclosures. Any or all of management’s forward-looking statements here and in other publications may turn out to be wrong.\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and are based on assumptions that may be materially different from actual results, and include, but are not limited to:\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFurther, increased highway construction funding pressures resulting from either federal or state issues can affect profitability. If these negatively affect transportation budgets more than in the past, construction spending could be reduced. Cement is subject to cyclical supply and demand and price fluctuations.\nThe Company’s principal business serves customers in construction markets. This concentration could increase the risk of potential losses on customer receivables; however, payment bonds normally posted on public projects, together with lien rights on private projects, mitigate the risk of uncollectible receivables. The level of demand in the Company’s end-use markets, production levels and the management of production costs will affect the operating leverage of the Building Materials business and, therefore, profitability. Production costs in the Building Materials business are also sensitive to energy and raw material prices, both directly and indirectly. Diesel fuel, coal and other consumables change production costs directly through consumption or indirectly by increased energy-related input costs, such as steel, explosives, tires and conveyor belts. Fluctuating diesel fuel pricing also affects transportation costs, primarily through fuel surcharges in the Company’s long-haul distribution network. The Magnesia Specialties business is sensitive to changes in domestic steel capacity utilization as well as the absolute price and fluctuation in the cost of natural gas.\nTransportation in the Company’s long-haul network, particularly the supply of railcars and locomotive power and condition of rail infrastructure to move trains, affects the Company’s efficient transportation of aggregates products in certain markets, most notably Texas, Colorado, Florida, North Carolina and the Gulf Coast. In addition, availability of railcars and locomotives affects the Company’s movement of essential dolomitic lime for magnesia chemicals to both the Company’s plant in Manistee, Michigan, and its customers. The availability of trucks, drivers and railcars to transport the Company’s product, particularly in markets experiencing high growth and increased demand, is also a risk and pressures the associated costs.\nAll of the Company’s businesses are also subject to weather-related risks that can significantly affect production schedules and profitability. The first and fourth quarters are most adversely affected by winter weather. Hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast generally is most active during the third and fourth quarters.\nRisks also include shipment declines resulting from economic events beyond the Company’s control.\nIn addition to the foregoing, other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report include but are not limited to those listed above in Item 1, “Business – Competition,\n” Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and\n“Note A: Accounting Policies” and “Note O: Commitments and Contingencies” of the “Notes to Financial Statements” of the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nYou should consider these forward-looking statements in light of risk factors discussed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and other filings made with the SEC.  All of the Company’s forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these factors.  In addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company considers immaterial could affect the accuracy of its forward-looking statements, or adversely affect or be material to the Company.  All forward-looking statements are made as of the date of filing or publication and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk"

    "text": "As discussed earlier, the Company’s operations are highly dependent upon the interest rate-sensitive construction and steelmaking industries. Consequently, these marketplaces could experience lower levels of economic activity in an environment of rising interest rates or escalating costs (see\nBusiness Environment\nsection included under Item 7 – MD&A of this Form 10-K).\nManagement has considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to the Company’s business. Demand for aggregates products, particularly in the infrastructure construction market, is affected by federal and state budget and deficit issues. Further, delays or cancellations of capital projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence is eroded by economic uncertainty.\nDemand in the residential construction market is affected by interest rates. During 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate, and at December 31, 2020, the rate was 0.09%. The residential construction market accounted for approximately 24% of the Company’s aggregates shipments in 2020.\nAside from these inherent risks from within its operations, the Company’s earnings are also affected by changes in short-term interest rates.\nVariable-Rate Borrowing Facilities\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had a $700 million Revolving Facility and a $400 million Trade Receivable Facility.  Borrowings under these facilities bear interest at a variable interest rate. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any outstanding variable-rate debt.  However, any future borrowings under the credit facilities or outstanding variable-rate debt are exposed to interest rate risk.\nPension Expense\nThe Company’s results of operations are affected by its pension expense. Assumptions that affect pension expense include the discount rate and, for the defined benefit pension plans only, the expected long-term rate of return on assets. Therefore, the Company has interest rate risk associated with these factors. The impact of hypothetical changes in these assumptions on the Company’s annual pension expense is discussed in the\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates – Pension Expense – Selection of Assumptions\nsection included under Item 7 – MD&A of this Form 10-K.\nEnergy Costs\nEnergy costs, including diesel fuel, natural gas, coal, petroleum coke and liquid asphalt, represent significant production costs of the Company. The Company may be unable to pass along increases in the costs of energy to customers in the form of price increases for the Company’s products. The cement product line and Magnesia Specialties business each have varying fixed-price agreements for a portion of their energy requirements. A hypothetical 10% change in the Company’s energy prices in 2021 as compared with 2020, assuming constant volumes, would change 2021 energy expense by $23.1 million.\nCommodity Risk\nCement is a commodity and competition is based principally on price, which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand. Prices are often subject to material changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and demand, general economic conditions and other market conditions beyond the Company’s control. Increases in the production capacity of industry participants or increases in cement imports tend to create an oversupply of such products leading to an imbalance between supply and demand, which can have a negative impact on product prices. There can be no assurance that product prices will not decline in the future or that such declines will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. A hypothetical 10% change in sales price of the cement product line would impact cement product line revenues by $45.3 million.\nCement is a key raw material in the production of ready mixed concrete. The Company may be unable to pass along increases in the costs of cement and raw materials to customers in the form of price increases for the Company’s products. A hypothetical 10% change in cement costs in 2021 compared with 2020, assuming constant volumes, would change the ready mixed concrete product line cost of sales by $25.5 million. While increases in cement pricing may negatively impact the profitability of the ready mixed concrete operations, the cement business would benefit, although the positive impact may not reflect a direct correlation to the impact to the ready mix business.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"

    "text": "Additional information required in response to this Item 8 is included under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” included as Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nStatement of Responsibility and Management’s\nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement’s Statement of Responsibility\nThe management of Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (the Company or Martin Marietta) is responsible for the consolidated financial statements, the related financial information contained in this Form 10-K and the establishment and maintenance of adequate internal control over financial reporting. The consolidated balance sheets for Martin Marietta, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, total equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, include amounts based on estimates and judgments and\nhave been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States applied on a consistent basis.\nA system of internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance, in a cost-effective manner, that assets are safeguarded, transactions are executed and recorded in accordance with management’s authorization, accountability for assets is maintained and financial statements are prepared and presented fairly in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control systems over financial reporting have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nThe Company operates in an environment that establishes an appropriate system of internal control over financial reporting and ensures that the system is maintained, assessed and monitored on a periodic basis. This internal control system includes examinations by internal audit staff and oversight by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nThe Company’s management recognizes its responsibility to foster a strong ethical climate. Management has issued written policy statements that document the Company’s business code of ethics. The importance of ethical behavior is regularly communicated to all employees through the distribution of the\nCode of Ethical Business Conduct\nand through ongoing education and review programs designed to create a strong commitment to ethical business practices.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which consists of four independent, nonemployee directors, meets periodically and separately with management, the independent auditors and the internal auditors to review the activities of each. The Audit Committee meets standards established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the New York Stock Exchange as they relate to the composition and practices of audit committees.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe management of Martin Marietta is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on management’s assessment under the 2013 framework, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, have\nbeen audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, whose report appears on the following page.\nFebruary 19, 2021\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nReport of Independent Registe\nred Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, total equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 appearing under Item 15(c) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nthat receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements\n.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of the Projected Benefit Obligation\nAs described in Note K to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s net projected benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $1,111.9 million as of December 31, 2020. As disclosed by management, annually, as of December 31, management remeasures the defined benefit plans’ projected benefit obligation based on the present value of projected future benefit payments to all participants for services rendered to date, reflecting expected future pay increases through the participants’ expected retirement dates. The key assumptions are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the mortality table and mortality improvement scale, and the rate of increase in future compensation levels.  The discount rate is generally the most volatile and sensitive estimate. Accordingly, a change in this assumption has the most significant impact on the projected benefit obligation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the projected benefit obligation is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management to determine the projected benefit obligation; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the discount rate assumption; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of the projected benefit obligation, including controls over the discount rate assumption. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the valuation of the projected benefit obligation and the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in (i) testing management’s process for determining the projected benefit obligation, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the actuarial method, and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate assumption.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nRaleigh, North Carolina\nFebruary 19, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nFinancial Statements\nThe accompanying Notes to the Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe accompanying Notes to the Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe accompanying Notes to the Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe accompanying Notes to the Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe accompanying Notes to the Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nNotes to Financial Statements\nNote A: Accounting Policies\nOrganization.\nMartin Marietta is a natural resource-based building materials company. The Company supplies aggregates (crushed stone, sand and gravel) through its network of approximately\n300\nquarries, mines and distribution yards in\n27\nstates, Canada and The Bahamas.  In the western United States, Martin Marietta also provides cement and downstream products, namely, ready mixed concrete, asphalt and paving services, in markets where the Company also has a leading aggregates position. Specifically, the Company has\ntwo\ncement plants and several cement distribution facilities in Texas and Louisiana, and\n120\nready mixed concrete plants and\neight\nasphalt plants in Texas, Colorado and Wyoming. Asphalt operations and paving services are exclusively in Colorado. The Company’s heavy-side building materials are used in infrastructure, nonresidential and residential construction projects. Aggregates are also used in agricultural, utility and environmental applications and as railroad ballast. The aggregates, cement, ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines are reported collectively as the Building Materials business.\nEffective July 1, 2020, the Company made organizational changes, consolidating its operational management and operating divisions in connection with the retirement of\ntwo\nsenior executives as of the end of the second quarter. The Mid-Atlantic Division and Southeast Division were combined to form the East Division. Additionally, the Southwest Aggregates Division and the Cement and Southwest Ready Mix Division were combined to form the Southwest Division. Subsequent to these changes, the Building Materials business consists of\nfour\ndivisions: East, Central, Southwest and West. Each division, as well as the Magnesia Specialties business, represents an operating segment.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Building Materials business contains the following reportable segments: East Group and West Group. The East Group, whose operations were previously reported in the Mid-America and Southeast Groups, consists of the East and Central Divisions and operates in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, eastern Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Nova Scotia and The Bahamas. The West Group is comprised of the Southwest and West Divisions and operates in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, western Nebraska, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. In addition to these states, the Company sells to customers in New York, Delaware, New Mexico and Mississippi. The following states accounted for\n71\n% of the Building Materials business’ 2020 total revenues: Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Iowa. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company moved the management of its one quarry in the state of Washington from the East Group to the West Group, resulting in an immaterial change to its reportable segments. Prior-year segment disclosures have been reclassified to conform to current-year presentation.\nThe Company also operates a Magnesia Specialties business, which produces magnesia-based chemical products used in industrial, agricultural and environmental applications, and dolomitic lime sold primarily to customers for steel production and land stabilization. Magnesia Specialties’ production facilities are located in Ohio and Michigan, and products are shipped to customers worldwide. During 2020, there were no changes to the Magnesia Specialties reportable segment.\nBasis of Presentation and\nUse of Estimates.\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets as well as assumptions used in the calculation of income tax expense, retirement and postemployment benefits, stock-based compensation, the allocation of the purchase price to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of business combinations and revenue recognition for service contracts.  These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s judgment. Management evaluates estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, and adjusts such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Changes in credit, equity and energy markets and changes in construction activity increase the uncertainty inherent in certain estimates and assumptions. As future events and their effects, including the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the related responses, cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from estimates. Changes in estimates, including those resulting from changes in the economic environment, are reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the period in which the change in estimate occurs. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company identified a prior-period error that overstated its earnings from a nonconsolidated equity affiliate. The pretax noncash adjustment was deemed immaterial to prior periods and was therefore corrected as an out-of-period expense of $\n15.7\nmillion\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nthat was\nrecorded in other nonoperating expenses, consistent with the recurring classification of equity earnings from the nonconsolidated affiliate.\nBasis of Consolidation\n.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Partially-owned affiliates are either consolidated or accounted for using the cost method or the equity method, depending on the level of ownership interest or the Company’s ability to exercise control over the affiliates’ operations. Intercompany balances and transactions between subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.\nRevenue Recognition\n.\nTotal revenues include sales of products and services provided to customers, net of discounts or allowances, if any, and include freight and delivery costs billed to customers. Revenues for product sales are recognized when control of the promised good is transferred to unaffiliated customers, typically when finished products are shipped. Revenues derived from the paving business are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method under the cost-to-cost approach. Under the cost-to-cost approach, recognized contract revenue is determined by multiplying the total estimated contract revenue by the estimated percentage of completion. Contract costs are recognized as incurred. The percentage of completion is determined on a contract-by-contract basis using project costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated project costs. The Company believes the cost-to-cost approach is appropriate, as the use of asphalt in a paving contract is relatively consistent with the performance of the related paving services. Paving contracts, notably with governmental entities, may contain performance bonuses based on quality specifications. Given the uncertainty of meeting the criteria until the performance obligation is completed, performance bonuses are recognized as revenues when and if achieved. Performance bonuses were not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Freight revenues reflect delivery arranged by the Company using a third party on behalf of the customer and are recognized consistently with the timing of the product revenues.\nFreight and Delivery Costs\n.\nFreight and delivery costs represent pass-through transportation costs incurred and paid by the Company to third-party carriers to deliver products to customers. These costs are then billed to the customers.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\n.\nCash equivalents are comprised of highly-liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had $\n97.1\nmillion of restricted cash, which was invested in an account designated for the purchase of like-kind exchange replacement assets under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 1031). The Company is restricted from utilizing the cash for purposes other than the purchase of the qualified assets for\n180\ndays from receipt of the proceeds from the sale of the exchanged property. Any unused cash at the end of the\n180\ndays will be transferred to unrestricted accounts of the Company and can then be used for general corporate purposes. The Company did not use $\n47.2\nmillion within the allowable\n180\n-day period and transferred that amount to unrestricted cash in January 2021. The Company has until March 9, 2021 to utilize the remaining funds to purchase qualified assets under Section 1031.\nIn connection with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-18,\nStatement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)\n, the statement of cash flows reflects cash flow changes and balances for cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on an aggregated basis.\nThe following table reconciles cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as reported on the consolidated balance sheets to the aggregated amounts presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows:\nAccounts Receivable.\nAccounts receivable are stated at cost. The Company does not typically charge interest on customer accounts receivable. The Company records an allowance for credit losses, which includes a provision for probable losses based on historical write-offs, adjusted for current conditions as deemed necessary, and a specific reserve for accounts deemed at risk. The allowance is the Company’s estimate for receivables as of the balance sheet date that ultimately will not be collected. Any changes in the allowance are reflected in earnings in the period in which the change occurs. The Company writes-off accounts receivable when it becomes probable, based upon customer facts and circumstances, that such amounts will not be collected.\nInventories Valuation\n.\nFinished products and in process inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using standard costs, which approximate the first-in, first-out method. Carrying value for parts and supplies are determined by the weighted-average cost method. The Company records an allowance for finished product inventories based on an analysis of future demand and inventory on hand in excess of historical sales for a\ntwelve-month\nperiod or an annual average for a period of up to\nfive year\ns. The Company also establishes an allowance for parts over\nfive years\nold and supplies over a year old.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nPost-production stripping costs, which represent costs of removing overburden and waste materials to access mineral deposits, are a component of inventory production costs and recognized as incurred.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n.\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost.\nThe estimated service lives for property, plant and equipment are as follows:\nThe Company begins capitalizing quarry development costs at a point when reserves are determined to be proven or probable, economically mineable and when demand supports investment in the market. Capitalization of these costs ceases when production commences. Capitalized quarry development costs are classified as land improvements and depreciated over the life of the reserves.\nThe Company reviews relevant facts and circumstances to determine whether to capitalize or expense pre-production stripping costs when additional pits are developed at an existing quarry. If the additional pit operates in a separate and distinct area of the quarry, these costs are capitalized as quarry development costs and depreciated over the life of the uncovered reserves. Additionally, a separate asset retirement obligation is created for additional pits when the liability is incurred. Once a pit enters the production phase, all post-production stripping costs are charged to inventory production costs as incurred.\nMineral reserves and mineral interests acquired in connection with a business combination are valued using an income approach for the estimated life of the reserves. The Company’s aggregates reserves average approximately 90 years, based on 2020 production levels.\nDepreciation is computed based on estimated service lives using the straight-line method. Depletion of mineral reserves is calculated based on proven and probable reserves using the units-of-production method on a quarry-by-quarry basis.\nProperty, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if expected future undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining service life of the related asset group are less than the asset group’s carrying value.\nRepair and Maintenance Costs.\nRepair and maintenance costs that do not substantially extend the life of the Company’s plant and equipment are expensed as incurred.\nLeases.\nIf the Company determines a contract is or contains a lease at inception of the agreement, the Company records right-of-use (ROU) assets, which represent the Company’s right to use an underlying leased asset, and leased liabilities, which represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments. The ROU asset and lease liability are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The Company determines the present value of lease payments based on the implicit interest rate, which may be explicitly stated in the lease, if available, or may be the Company’s estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the term of the lease.  Initial ROU assets also include any lease payments made at or before commencement date and any initial direct costs incurred and are reduced by lease incentives. Certain of the Company’s leases contain renewal and/or termination options. The Company recognizes renewal or termination options as part of its ROU assets and lease liabilities when the Company has the unilateral right to renew or terminate and it is reasonably certain these options will be exercised.\nSome leases require the Company to pay non-lease components, which may include taxes, maintenance, insurance and certain other expenses applicable to the leased property, and are primarily variable costs.  The Company accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single amount, with the exception of railcar and fleet vehicle leases, for which the Company separately accounts for the lease and non-lease components.\nLeases are evaluated and determined to be either operating leases or finance leases.  The lease is a finance lease if it: transfers ownership to the underlying asset by the end of the lease term; includes a purchase option that is reasonably certain to be exercised; has a lease term for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset; has a present value of the sum of the lease payments that equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset; or is for an underlying asset that is of a specialized nature and is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term.  If none of these terms exist, the lease is an operating lease.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nL\neases with an initial\nlease term of one year or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Costs for these leases are expensed as incurred\n.\nIn the consolidated statements of earnings, operating lease expense, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and the amortization of finance lease ROU assets are included in cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expenses.  Accretion on the liabilities for finance leases is included in interest expense.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price paid for acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities. Other intangible assets represent amounts assigned principally to contractual agreements and are either amortized ratably over the useful lives to the Company or not amortized if deemed to have an indefinite useful life.\nThe Company’s reporting units, which represent the level at which goodwill is tested for impairment, are based on the operating segments of the Building Materials business. Goodwill is assigned to the respective reporting unit(s) based on the location of acquisitions at the time of consummation. Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value, which represents a Step-1 approach. However, prior to Step 1, the Company may perform a qualitative assessment and evaluate macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other business or reporting unit-specific events that contribute to the fair value of a reporting unit.  If the Company concludes it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) that a reporting unit’s fair value is higher than its carrying value, the Company is not required to perform any further goodwill impairment testing for that reporting unit. Otherwise, the Company proceeds to Step 1, and if a reporting unit’s fair value exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment. A reporting unit with a carrying value in excess of its fair value results in an impairment charge equal to the difference.\nThe carrying values of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, as of October 1. An interim review is performed between annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate potential impairment. The carrying value of other amortizable intangible assets is reviewed if facts and circumstances indicate potential impairment. If a review indicates the carrying value is impaired, a charge is recorded.\nRetirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits.\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit retirement plans and also provides other postretirement benefits. The Company recognizes the funded status, defined as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation, of its pension plans and other postretirement benefits as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets. Actuarial gains or losses that arise during the year are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive earnings or loss. Those amounts are amortized over the participants’ average remaining service period and recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost.  The amount amortized is determined using a corridor approach and represents the excess over\n10\n% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or pension plan assets.\nInsurance Reserves.\nThe Company has insurance coverage with large deductibles for workers’ compensation, automobile liability, marine liability and general liability claims, and is also self-insured for health claims. The Company records insurance reserves based on an actuarial-determined analysis, which calculates development factors that are applied to total case reserves within the insurance programs. While the Company believes the assumptions used to calculate these liabilities are appropriate,\nsignificant differences in actual experience and/or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect insurance costs\n.\nStock-Based Compensation.\nThe Company has stock-based compensation plans for employees and its Board of Directors. The Company recognizes all forms of stock-based awards that vest as compensation expense. The compensation expense is the fair value of the awards at the measurement date and is recognized over the requisite service period. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.\nThe fair value of restricted stock awards, incentive compensation stock awards and Board of Directors’ fees paid in the form of common stock are based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant dates.  The fair value of performance stock awards as of the grant dates is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology.\nEnvironmental Matters.\nThe Company records a liability for an asset retirement obligation at fair value in the period in which it is incurred. The asset retirement obligation is recorded at the acquisition date of a long-lived tangible asset if the fair value can be reasonably estimated. A corresponding amount is capitalized as part of the asset’s carrying amount. The fair value is affected by management’s assumptions regarding the scope of the work, inflation rates and asset retirement dates.\nFurther, the Company records an accrual for other environmental remediation liabilities in the period in which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the appropriate amounts can be estimated reasonably. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Generally, these costs are not discounted to their present value or offset for potential insurance or other claims or potential gains from future alternative uses for a site.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nIncome Taxes\n.\nDeferred income taxes, net, on the consolidated balance sheets reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, net of valuation allowances. The effect of changes in enacted tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is charged or credited to income tax expense in the period of enactment.\nUncertain Tax Positions.\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit when it is more-likely-than-not, based on the technical merits, that a tax position would be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. The amount to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than\n50\n% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The Company’s unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or as an offset to the deferred tax asset for tax carryforwards where available.\nThe Company records interest accrued in relation to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Penalties, if incurred, are recorded as operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nSales Taxes.\nSales taxes collected from customers are recorded as liabilities until remitted to taxing authorities and therefore are not reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nStart-Up Costs.\nNoncapital start-up costs for new facilities and products are charged to operations as incurred.\nConsolidated Comprehensive Earnings and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\n.\nConsolidated comprehensive earnings for the Company consist of consolidated net earnings, adjustments for the funded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans, foreign currency translation adjustments and the amortization of the value of terminated forward starting interest rate\nswap agreements into interest expense, and are presented in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings\n.\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss consists of unrecognized gains and losses related to the funded status of the pension and postretirement benefit plans and foreign currency translation, and is presented on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe components of the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss and related cumulative noncurrent deferred tax assets are as follows:\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nReclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive loss are as follows:\nEarnings Per Common Share\n.\nThe Company computes earnings per common share (EPS) pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method determines EPS for common stock and participating securities according to dividends or dividend equivalents and their respective participation rights in undistributed earnings. The Company paid nonforfeitable dividend equivalents during the vesting period on its restricted stock awards and incentive stock awards made prior to 2016, which results in these being considered participating securities.\nThe numerator for basic and diluted earnings per common share is net earnings attributable to Martin Marietta, reduced by dividends and undistributed earnings attributable to the Company’s participating securities. The denominator for basic earnings per common share is the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed assuming that the weighted-average number of common shares is increased by the conversion, using the treasury stock method, of awards issued to employees and nonemployee members of the Company’s Board of Directors under certain stock-based compensation arrangements if the conversion is dilutive.\nThe following table reconciles the numerator and denominator for basic and diluted earnings per common share:\nReclassifications\n.\nCertain reclassifications were made to the comparative years’ financial statements and notes to the financial statements to conform to the December 31, 2020 presentation.  Such reclassifications had no impact on the Company’s previously reported results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nCredit Losses\nEffective\nJanuary 1, 2020\n, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses\n(ASU 2016-13), which includes a current expected credit loss (CECL) model that requires an entity to estimate credit losses expected over the life of an exposure or pool of exposures based on historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts at the time the asset is recognized and is remeasured at each reporting period. ASU 2016-13 primarily relates to the Company’s receivables, but the scope also includes retainage and contract assets related to its paving business. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or statement of earnings and comprehensive earnings, but the Company amended its allowance for credit losses policy for the implementation of ASU 2016-13.\nDefined Benefit Plan Disclosures\nEffective for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2018-14,\nCompensation—Retirement Benefits—Defined Benefit Plans—General\n(ASU 2018-14), which simplifies disclosures requirements for defined benefit plans. ASU 2018-14 requires explanations for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation; eliminates sensitivity disclosures for a one-percent change in the assumed health care cost trend rate; and eliminates the disclosure of the estimated amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit costs over the next year. Disclosures in Note K have been modified on a retrospective basis for all years presented.\nLeases\nEffective\nJanuary 1, 2019\n, the Company adopted ASC 842, which applies to virtually all leases, excluding mineral interest royalty agreements.  ASC 842 requires the modified retrospective transition approach, applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. It further states that an entity may use either 1) its effective date or 2) the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements as its date of initial application. The Company used the effective date as the date of initial application. As such, financial information and disclosures required under ASC 842 are not provided for dates and periods prior to January 1, 2019.\nThe lease standard provides a number of practical expedients for transition accounting. The Company elected the “package of practical expedients”, which permitted the Company to not reassess its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. The Company elected the practical expedients pertaining to the use of hindsight and to land easements. Applying the hindsight practical expedient resulted in longer lease terms for many leases.\nThe adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities of $\n502.5\nmillion and $\n501.6\nmillion, respectively, for operating leases and $\n10.9\nmillion and $\n12.1\nmillion, respectively, for finance leases. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statement of earnings or consolidated statement of cash flows\n.\nNote B: Revenue Recognition\nPerformance Obligations.\nPerformance obligations are contractual promises to transfer or provide a distinct good or service for a stated price. The Company’s product sales agreements are single-performance obligations that are satisfied at a point in time.\nPerformance obligations within paving service agreements are satisfied over time, primarily ranging from\none day\nto\ntwo years\n. For product revenues and freight revenues, customer payment terms are generally\n30\ndays from invoice date. Customer payments for the paving operations are based on a contractual billing schedule and are due\n30\ndays from invoice date.\nFuture revenues from unsatisfied performance obligations at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $\n110.1\nmillion, $\n136.1\nmillion\nand $\n78.1\nmillion,\nrespectively, where the remaining periods\nto complete these obligations ranged from\none month\nto\n22\nmonths\n.\nSales Taxes.\nThe Company is deemed to be an agent when collecting sales taxes from customers.  Sales taxes collected are recorded as liabilities until remitted to taxing authorities and are not reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings as revenues and expenses.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nRevenue by Category.\nThe following table presents the Company’s total revenues by category for each reportable segment:\nService revenues, which solely include the paving operations located in Colorado, were $\n287.6\nmillion, $\n250.6\nmillion and $\n219.6\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nContract Balances.\nCosts in excess of billings relate to the conditional right to consideration for completed contractual performance and are contract assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs in excess of billings are reclassified to accounts receivable when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Billings in excess of costs relate to customers invoiced in advance of contractual performance and are contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table presents information about the Company’s contract balances:\nRevenues recognized from the beginning balance of contract liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $\n6.9\nmillion and $\n6.6\nmillion, respectively.\nRetainage, which primarily relates to the paving services, represents amounts that have been billed to customers but payment withheld until final acceptance of the performance obligation by the customer. Included\nin\nOther current assets\non the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, retainage was $\n10.6\nmillion and $\n10.2\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nPolicy Elections.\nWhen the Company arranges third-party freight to deliver products to customers, the Company has elected the delivery to be a fulfillment activity rather than a separate performance obligation.  Further, the Company acts as a principal in the delivery arrangements and, as required by the revenue standard, the related revenues and costs are presented gross and are included in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nNote C: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe following table shows the changes in goodwill by reportable segment and in total:\nIntangible assets subject to amortization consist of the following:\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nIntangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life that are therefore not amortized consist of the following:\nDuring 2020, the Company acquired $\n35.2\nmillion of intangible assets, consisting of the following:\nTotal amortization expense for intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n13.4\nmillion, $\n13.0\nmillion and $\n13.9\nmillion, respectively.\nThe estimated amortization expense for intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows:\nNote D: Business Combinations\nIn August 2020, the Company acquired certain assets, including a sand and gravel plant and\nfour\nready mixed concrete operations. This acquisition provides customer expansion in the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas market and the ability to internally source ready mixed concrete raw materials from the Company’s legacy aggregates and cement operations. The Company determined fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As of December 31, 2020, the measurement period is closed. The impact of this acquisition is not material to the Company’s operating results; therefore, pro-forma financial information is not included.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nNote E: Accounts Receivable, Net\nOf the total accounts receivable, net, balances, $\n3.9\nmillion and $\n2.9\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were due from unconsolidated affiliates.\nNote F: Inventories, Net\nNote G: Property, Plant and Equipment, Net\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization expense related to property, plant and equipment was $\n376.3\nmillion, $\n354.4\nmillion and $\n326.1\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for 2020 and 2019 includes amortization of right-of-use assets from finance leases and for 2018 includes amortization of machinery and equipment under capital leases.\nInterest expense of $\n4.2\nmillion, $\n5.1\nmillion and $\n3.0\nmillion was capitalized during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, $\n46.0\nmillion and $\n49.7\nmillion, respectively, of the Building Materials business’ property, plant and equipment, net, were located in foreign countries, namely The Bahamas and Canada.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nNote H: Long-Term Debt\nOn March 5, 2020, the Company issued $\n500\n.0 million aggregate principal amount of\n2.500\n% Senior Notes due\n2030\n(the 2.500% Senior Notes). The 2.500% Senior Notes are carried net of original issue discount, which is being amortized by the effective interest method over the life of the issue. The 2.500% Senior Notes are redeemable prior to December 15, 2029 at their make-whole redemption price at a discount rate of the U.S. Treasury Rate plus\n30\nbasis points, or on or after December 15, 2029 at a redemption price equal to\n100\n% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The Company used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of $\n300.0\nmillion of Floating Rate Senior Notes at maturity in May 2020. At December 31, 2019, the Floating Rate Senior Notes due May 2020 were classified as noncurrent long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as the Company had the intent and ability to refinance the notes on a long-term basis.\nThe Company’s\n4.25\n% Senior Notes due\n2024\n,\n7\n% Debentures due\n2025\n,\n3.450\n% Senior Notes due\n2027\n,\n3.500\n% Senior Notes due\n2027\n,\n2.500\n% Senior Notes due\n2030\n,\n6.25\n% Senior Notes due\n2037\nand\n4.250\n% Senior Notes due\n2047\n(collectively, the Senior Notes) are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, ranking equal in right of payment with the Company’s existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness.  Upon a change-of-control repurchase event and a resulting below-investment-grade credit rating, the Company would be required to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Senior Notes, with the exception of the 7% Debentures due 2025, at a price in cash equal to\n101\n% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe Senior Notes are carried net of original issue discount, which is being amortized by the effective interest method over the life of the issue. The Senior Notes are redeemable prior to their respective maturity dates at a make-whole redemption price. The principal amount, effective interest rate and maturity date for the Senior Notes are as follows:\nThe Company has a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Truist Bank, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc., and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Co-Syndication Agents, and the lenders party thereto (the Credit Agreement), which provides for a $\n700.0\nmillion\nfive-year\nsenior unsecured revolving facility (the Revolving Facility). Borrowings under the Revolving Facility bear interest, at the Company’s option, at rates based upon the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or a base rate, plus, for each rate, a margin determined in accordance with a ratings-based pricing grid.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe Credit Agreement requires the Company’s ratio of consolidated net debt-to-consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, as defined, for the trailing-twelve months (the Ratio) to not exceed\n3.50\nx as of the end of any fiscal quarter, provided that the Company may exclude from the Ratio debt incurred in connection with certain acquisitions during the quarter or three preceding quarters so long as the Ratio calculated without such exclusion does not exceed\n3.75\nx.  Additionally, if no amounts are outstanding under both the Revolving Facility and the trade receivable securitization facility (discussed later), consolidated debt, including debt for which the Company is a co-borrower (see Note O), shall be reduced by the Company’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of $\n50.0\nmillion, such reduction not to\nexceed $\n200.0\nmillion, for purposes of the covenant calculation. The Company was in compliance with the Ratio at December 31, 2020.\nThe Revolving Facility expires on\nDecember 5, 2024\n, with any outstanding principal amounts, together with interest accrued thereon, due in full on that date.\nAvailable borrowings under the Revolving Facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit issued by the Company under the Revolving Facility.  At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $\n2.6\nmillion and $\n2.3\nmillion, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit issued under the Revolving Facility and $\n697.4\nmillion and $\n697.7\nmillion, respectively, available for borrowing under the Revolving Facility. The Company paid the bank group an upfront loan\ncommitment fee that is being amortized over the life of the Revolving Facility. The Revolving Facility includes an annual facility fee.\nThe Company, through a wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary, has a $\n400.0\nmillion trade receivable securitization facility (the Trade Receivable Facility). On September 23, 2020, the Company extended the maturity to\nSeptember 22, 2021\n. The Trade Receivable Facility, with Truist Bank, Regions Bank, PNC Bank, N.A., The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., New York Branch, and certain other lenders that may become a party to the facility from time to time, is backed by eligible trade receivables, as defined. Borrowings are limited to the lesser of the facility limit or the borrowing base, as defined. These receivables are originated by the Company and then sold or contributed to the wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary. The Company continues to be responsible for the servicing and administration of the receivables purchased by the wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary. Borrowings under the Trade Receivable Facility bear interest at a rate equal to asset-backed commercial paper costs of conduit lenders plus\n0.85\n% for borrowings funded by conduit lenders and one-month LIBOR plus\n1.00\n%, subject to change in the event that this rate no longer reflects the lender’s cost of lending\n,\nfor borrowings funded by all other lenders\n. The Trade Receivable Facility contains a cross-default provision to the Company’s other debt agreements.  At December 31, 2020, there were\nno\nborrowings outstanding under the Trade Receivable Facility and $\n340.0\nmillion of borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2019.\nThe Company’s long-term debt maturities for the five years following December 31, 2020, and thereafter are:\nNote I: Financial Instruments\nThe Company’s financial instruments include temporary cash investments, restricted cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable, publicly-registered long-term notes, debentures and other long-term debt.\nTemporary cash investments are placed primarily in money market funds, money market demand deposit accounts or offshore time deposit accounts with financial institutions. The Company’s cash equivalents have maturities of less than three months. Due\nto the short maturity of these investments, they are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at cost, which approximates fair value.\nRestricted cash is held in a trust account with a third-party intermediary. Due to the short-term nature of this account, the fair value of restricted cash approximates its carrying value.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nAccounts receivable are due from a large number of customers, primarily in the construction industry, and are dispersed across wide geographic and economic regions. However, accounts receivable are more heavily concentrated in certain states, namely\nTexas, Colorado, North Carolina,\nGeorgia and Iowa\n. The estimated fair values of accounts receivable approximate their carrying amounts\n.\nNotes receivable are primarily promissory notes with customers and are not publicly traded. Management estimates that the fair value of notes receivable approximates its carrying amount.\nAccounts payable represent amounts owed to suppliers and vendors. The estimated fair value of accounts payable approximates its carrying amount due to the short-term nature of the payables.\nThe carrying values and fair values of the Company’s long-term debt were $\n2.63\nbillion and $\n3.08\nbillion, respectively, at December 31, 2020 and $\n2.77\nbillion and $\n2.94\nbillion, respectively, at December 31, 2019. The estimated fair value of the Company’s publicly-registered long-term debt was estimated based on Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy using quoted market prices. The estimated fair values of other borrowings, which primarily represent variable-rate debt, approximate their carrying amounts as the interest rates reset periodically.\nNote J: Income Taxes\nThe components of the Company’s income tax expense are as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the benefit related to the utilization of federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards, reflected in current tax expense, was $\n5.8\nmillion. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company completed the accounting for the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and recorded a net income tax benefit of $18.9 million, primarily related to the accelerated deductions for pension funding, inventory and insurance prepayments that were claimed on the Company’s 2017 income tax returns.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, foreign pretax earnings were $\n8.9\nmillion, $\n15.1\nmillion and $\n5.7\nmillion, respectively.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe Company’s effective income tax rate varied from the statutory United States income tax rate because of the following\ntax differences:\nThe statutory depletion deduction for all years is calculated as a percentage of sales, subject to certain limitations. Due to these limitations, the impact of changes in the sales volumes and earnings may not proportionately affect the Company’s statutory depletion deduction and the corresponding impact on the effective income tax rate.\nIn 2020, the Company financed third-party railroad track maintenance. In exchange, the Company received a federal income tax credit and deduction.\nThe Company recognized a net tax benefit from the change in tax status of a subsidiary from a partnership to a corporation in 2019, which reduced income tax expense and increased consolidated net earnings by $\n15.2\nmillion, or $\n0.24\nper diluted share.\nThe principal components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nThe Company had $\n3.1\nmillion and $\n4.1\nmillion of domestic federal NOL carryforwards at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company had domestic state NOL carryforwards of $\n137.1\nmillion and $\n161.0\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These carryforwards have various expiration dates through\n2040\n. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, deferred tax assets associated with these carryforwards were $\n9.0\nmillion and $\n10.5\nmillion, respectively, net of the federal benefit of the state deduction, for which valuation allowances of $\n8.1\nmillion and $\n9.0\nmillion, respectively, were recorded.  The Company also had domestic state tax credit carryforwards of $\n1.0\nmillion and $\n1.1\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which have various expiration dates through\n2040\n. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, deferred tax assets associated with these carryforwards were $\n0.8\nmillion and $\n0.9\nmillion, respectively, net of the federal benefit of the state deduction.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nDeferred tax liabilities for property, plant and equipment result from accelerated depreciation methods being used for income tax purposes as compared with the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.\nDeferred tax liabilities related to goodwill and other intangibles reflect the cessation of goodwill amortization for financial reporting purposes, while amortization continues for income tax purposes.\nThe Company expects to permanently reinvest the earnings from its wholly-owned Canadian and Bahamian subsidiaries, and accordingly, has not provided deferred taxes on the subsidiaries’ undistributed net earnings or basis differences.  The Company believes that the tax liability that would be incurred upon repatriation is immaterial at December 31, 2020.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and correlative effects of $\n0.2\nmillion, $\n1.7\nmillion and $\n0.6\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively:\nUnrecognized tax benefits are reversed as a discrete event if an examination of applicable tax returns is not initiated by a federal or state tax authority within the statute of limitations or upon effective settlement with federal or state tax authorities. For the year ended December 31, 2020, $\n9.7\nmillion was reversed into income upon the statute of limitations expiration for the 2016 and all prior open tax years. Management believes its accrual for unrecognized tax benefits is sufficient to cover uncertain tax positions reviewed during audits by taxing authorities.\nThe Company anticipates that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits may decrease up to $\n4.4\nmillion, excluding interest and correlative effects, during the twelve months ending December 31, 2021, due to the expiration of the statutes of limitations for the 2017 tax year.\nThe Company’s tax years subject to federal, state or foreign examinations are 2016 through 2020.\nNote K: Retirement Plans, Postretirement and Postemployment Benefits\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit retirement plans that cover substantially all employees. Additionally, the Company provides other postretirement benefits for certain employees, including medical benefits for retirees and their spouses and\nretiree life insurance. Employees starting on or after January 1, 2002 are not eligible for postretirement welfare plans. The Company also provides certain benefits, such as disability benefits, to former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement.\nThe measurement date for the Company’s defined benefit plans, postretirement benefit plans and postemployment benefit plans is December 31.\nDefined Benefit Retirement Plans.\nRetirement plan assets are invested in listed stocks, bonds, hedge funds, real estate and cash equivalents. Defined retirement benefits for salaried employees are based on each employee’s years of service and average compensation for a specified period of time before retirement. Defined retirement benefits for hourly employees are generally stated amounts for specified periods of service.\nThe Company sponsors a Supplemental Excess Retirement Plan (SERP) that generally provides for the payment of retirement benefits in excess of allowable Internal Revenue Code limits. The SERP generally provides for a lump-sum payment of vested benefits. When these benefit payments exceed the sum of the service and interest costs for the SERP during a year, the Company recognizes a pro rata portion of the SERP’s unrecognized actuarial loss as settlement expense.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe net periodic retirement benefit cost of defined benefit plans includes the following components:\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost, other than service cost, are included in the line item\nOther nonoperating (income) and expenses, net\n, in the consolidated statements of earnings. Based on the roles of the employees, service cost is included in\nCost of revenues – products and services\nor\nSelling\n,\ngeneral and administrative expenses\nline items in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nThe expected return on assets is calculated by applying an annually selected expected long-term rate of return assumption to the estimated fair value of the plan assets during the year, giving consideration to contributions and benefits paid.\nThe Company recognized the following amounts in consolidated comprehensive earnings:\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss includes the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic benefit cost:\nThe defined benefit plans’ change in projected benefit obligation is as follows:\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nActuarial losses in 2020 and 2019 are primarily attributable to lower discount rates compared with the prior year.\nThe Company’s change in plan assets, funded status and amounts recognized on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets are as follows:\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n974.0\nmillion and $\n878.7\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nBenefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows:\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31 are:\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31 are:\nThe expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on a building-block approach, whereby the components are weighted based on the allocation of pension plan assets.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company estimated the remaining lives of participants in the pension plans using the Pri-2012 Base tables.  The no-collar table was used for salaried participants and the blue-collar table was used for hourly\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nparticipants\n;\nboth tables\nwere\nadjusted to reflect the experience of the Company’s participants.\nThe Company used\nthe\nMP-2020 and\nMP-2018\nmortality improvement\nscale\nfor the years 20\n20\nand 201\n9, respectively\n.\nThe target allocation for 2020 and the actual pension plan asset allocation by asset class are as follows:\nThe Company’s investment strategy is for approximately\n45\n% of equity securities, excluding hedge funds and real estate, to be invested in mid-sized to large capitalization U.S. funds, with the remaining invested in small capitalization, emerging markets and international funds. Debt securities, or fixed income investments, are invested in funds benchmarked to the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.\nThe fair values of pension plan assets by asset class and fair value hierarchy level are as follows:\nReal estate investments are stated at estimated fair value, which is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair values of real estate\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\ninvestments generally do not reflect transaction costs\nthat\nmay be incurred upon disposition of the real estate investments and do not necessarily represent the prices at which the\nreal estate investments would be sold or repaid, since market prices of real estate investments can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller. An independent valuation consultant is employed to determine the fair value of the real estate investments. The value of hedge funds is based on the values of the sub-fund investments. In determining the fair value of each sub-fund’s investment, the hedge funds’ Board of Trustees uses the values provided by the sub-funds and any other considerations that may, in its judgment, increase or decrease such estimated value.\nPrivate infrastructure assets represent investments in a fund that is stated at fair value.  For financial assets in the fund that are actively traded in organized financial markets, fair value is based on exchange-quoted market prices.  For investments in the fund for which there is no quoted market price, fair value is determined by the Trustees/General Partner based on discounted expected future cash flows prepared by third-party professionals.\nIn 2020 and 2019, the Company made combined pension plan and SERP contributions of $\n88.4\nmillion and $\n58.9\nmillion, respectively. The Company currently estimates that it will contribute $\n82.6\nmillion to its pension plans in 2021.\nThe expected benefit payments to be paid from plan assets for each of the next five years and the five-year period thereafter are as follows:\nPostretirement Benefits\n.\nThe net periodic postretirement benefit credit for postretirement plans includes the following components:\nThe components of net periodic benefit credit, other than service cost, are included in the line item\nOther nonoperating (income) and expenses, net,\nin the consolidated statements of earnings.\nThe Company recognized the following amounts in consolidated comprehensive earnings:\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss includes the following amounts that have not yet been recognized in net periodic benefit credit:\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe postretirement health care plans’ change in benefit obligation is as follows:\nThe postretirement health care plans’ change in plan assets, funded status and amounts recognized on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets are as follows:\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31 are:\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine net postretirement benefit credit for the years ended December 31 are:\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company estimated the remaining lives of participants in the postretirement benefit plans using the Pri-2012 Base tables.  The no-collar table was used for salaried participants and the blue-collar table was used for hourly participants; both tables were adjusted to reflect the experience of the Company’s participants.  The Company used the MP-2020 and MP-2018 mortality improvement scales for the years 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nAssumed health care cost trend rates at December 31 are:\nThe Company estimates that it will contribute $\n1.3\nmillion to its postretirement health care plans in 2021.\nThe total expected benefit payments to be paid by the Company, net of participant contributions, for each of the next five years and the five-year period thereafter are as follows:\nDefined Contribution Plan\n.\nThe Company maintains a defined contribution plan that covers substantially all employees.

The Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. Stock-Based Award Plan, as amended from time to time, along with the Amended Omnibus Securities Award Plan, originally approved in 1994 (collectively, the Plans), are still effective for awards made prior to 2017. The Company has been authorized by the Board of Directors to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock for issuance under the stock-based award plans (see Note N).\nThe Company grants restricted stock awards under the Plans to a group of executive officers, key personnel and nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. The vesting of certain restricted stock awards is based on certain performance criteria over a specified period of time.  The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of those criteria. In addition, certain awards are granted to individuals to encourage retention and motivate key employees. These awards generally vest if the employee is continuously employed over a specified period of time and require no payment from the employee.  Awards granted to nonemployee members of the Board of Directors vest immediately.\nThe fair value of stock-based award grants is expensed over the vesting period. Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are expensed over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award.  Awards granted to nonemployee members of the Board of Directors are expensed immediately.\nAdditionally, an incentive compensation stock plan has been adopted under the Plans whereby certain participants may elect to use up to\n50\n% of their annual incentive compensation to acquire units representing shares of the Company’s common stock at a\n20\n% discount to the market value on the date of the incentive compensation award.  Certain executive officers are required to participate in the incentive compensation stock plan at established minimum levels. Participants receive unrestricted shares of common stock in an amount equal to their respective units generally at the end of a 34-month period of additional employment from the date of award or at retirement beginning at age 62. All rights of ownership of the common stock convey to the participants upon the issuance of their respective shares at the end of the ownership-vesting period.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe following table summarizes information for restricted stock awards and incentive compensation stock awards for 2020:\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of service-based restricted stock awards granted during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n222.39\n, $\n196.91\nand $\n211.03\n, respectively.  The weighted-average grant-date fair value of performance-based restricted stock\nawards granted during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n266.97\n, $\n192.27\nand $\n212.12\n, respectively.

    "text": "Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of December 31, 2020, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on that evaluation, the Company’s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nThe foregoing evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures was based on the definition in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), which requires that disclosure controls and procedures are effectively designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management’s report on internal control over financial reporting is included as the “Statement of Financial Responsibility and Management’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting” in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplemental Data,” of this Form 10-K.  The Company’s management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as of December 31, 2020.  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements contained herein, also audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. The audit report is included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nThe Company's management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that the Company’s control system will prevent all error and all fraud.  A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nPart II\n♦\nItem 9A – Controls and Procedures\nCEO and CFO Certifications\nIncluded among the exhibits to this Form 10-K are forms of “Certifications” of the Company’s CEO and CFO as required in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Section 302 Certification”).  The Section 302 Certifications refer to this evaluation of the Company’s disclosure policies and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.  The information in this section should be read in conjunction with the Section 302 Certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented."
