The success of these businesses depends on their ability to provide products and services that are useful for consumers and real estate, mortgage and other related services professionals and attractive to their advertisers, the breadth, depth and accuracy of information they provide and brand awareness and reputation.

See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for information regarding certain key performance indicators for the Foxtel Group.\n1\nChannel count includes standard definition channels, high definition versions of those channels, audio channels and two 4K Ultra HD channels.\n4\nThe Foxtel Group competes primarily with a variety of other video content providers, such as traditional Free To Air (“FTA”) TV operators in Australia, including the three major commercial FTA networks and two major government-funded FTA broadcasters, and content providers that deliver video programming over the internet to televisions, computers, tablets and mobile and other devices.

Additionally, in the U.K., HarperCollins publishes titles for the equivalent of the K-12 educational market.\nAs of June 30, 2021, HarperCollins offered approximately 140,000 publications in digital formats, and nearly all of HarperCollins’ new titles, as well as the majority of its entire catalog, are available as e-books. Digital sales, comprising revenues generated through the sale of e-books as well as downloadable audio books, represented approximately 22% of global consumer revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. With the widespread adoption of electronic formats by consumers, HarperCollins is publishing a number of titles in digital formats before, or instead of, publishing a print edition.\nDuring fiscal 2021, HarperCollins U.S. had 197 titles\n2\non the\nNew York Times\nprint and digital bestseller lists, with 29 titles hitting number one, including\nThe Boy, The Mole, The Fox and The Horse\nby Charlie Mackesy,\nThe Duke and I\nand\nThe Viscount Who Loved Me\nby Julia Quinn,\nThe Order\nby Daniel Silva,\nThe Hate U Give\nand\nConcrete Rose\nby Angie Thomas,\nThe One and Only Bob\nand\nThe One and Only Ivan\nby Katherine Applegate,\nThey Both Die at The End\nby Adam Silvera,\nClass Act\nand\nNew Kid\nby Jerry Craft,\nI Am Enough\nby Grace Byers,\nMagnolia Table, Volume\n2\nby Joanna Gaines,\nStrange Planet\nby Nathan W Pyle,\nThe Women of The Bible Speak\nby Shannon Bream,\nRealm Breaker\nby Victoria Aveyard,\nForgiving What You Can’t Forget\nby Lysa TerKeurst and\nThe Happy in a Hurry Cookbook\nby Steve and Kathy Doocy.\nHarperCollins derives its revenue from the sale of print and digital books to a customer base that includes global technology companies, traditional brick and mortar booksellers, wholesale clubs and discount stores, including Amazon, Apple, Barnes & Noble and Tesco. Revenues at the Book Publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of HarperCollins’ books in the marketplace, and are typically highest during the Company’s second fiscal quarter due to increased demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies.\n2\nExcludes HMH.\n8\nThe book publishing business operates in a highly competitive market that is quickly changing and continues to see technological innovations. HarperCollins competes with other large publishers, such as Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster and Hachette Livre, as well as with numerous smaller publishers, for the rights to works by well-known authors and public personalities; competition could also come from new entrants as barriers to entry in book publishing are low. In addition, HarperCollins competes for consumers with other media formats and sources such as movies, television programming, magazines and mobile content. The Company believes HarperCollins is well positioned in the evolving book publishing market with significant size and brand recognition across multiple categories and geographies.\nNews Media\nThe Company’s News Media segment consists primarily of News Corp Australia, News UK and the\nNew York Post\n. This segment also includes Wireless Group, operator of talkSPORT, the leading sports radio network in the U.K., and Virgin Radio, and Storyful, a social media content agency that enables the Company to source real-time video content through social media platforms. The News Media segment generates revenue primarily through sales of print and digital advertising and circulation and subscription sales of its print and digital products. Advertising revenues at the News Media segment are subject to seasonality, with revenues typically highest in the Company’s second fiscal quarter due to the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies.\nNews Corp Australia\nNews Corp Australia is one of the leading news and information providers in Australia by readership, with both print and digital mastheads covering a national, regional and suburban footprint. During the year ended December 31, 2020\n3\n, its daily, Sunday, weekly and bi-weekly newspapers were read by over 5.5 million Australians on average every week. In addition, its digital mastheads are among the leading digital news properties in Australia based on monthly unique audience data and had approximately 810,000 aggregate closing subscribers as of June 30, 2021.\nNews Corp Australia’s news portfolio includes\nThe Australian\nand\nThe Weekend Australian\n(National),\nThe Daily Telegraph\nand\nThe Sunday Telegraph\n(Sydney),\nHerald Sun\nand\nSunday Herald Sun\n(Melbourne),\nThe Courier Mail\nand\nThe Sunday Mail\n(Brisbane) and\nThe Advertiser\nand\nSunday Mail\n(Adelaide), as well as paid digital platforms for each.

Together, across print and digital, these brands reach approximately 70% of adult news readers in the U.K., or approximately 39 million people, based on the PAMCo report for the quarter ended March 31, 2021.\n5\nIn addition to revenue from advertising, circulation and subscription sales for its print and digital products, News UK generates revenue by providing third party printing services through its world-class printing facilities in England, Scotland and Ireland and is one of the largest contract printers in the U.K. News UK also distributes content through its digital platforms, including its websites, thesun.co.uk, thetimes.co.uk and thesundaytimes.co.uk, as well as mobile and tablet apps. In addition, News UK has assembled a portfolio of complementary ancillary product offerings, including betting and gaming products. The following table provides information regarding News UK’s news portfolio:\n________________________\n(1)\nAs of June 30, 2021, based on internal sources.\n(2)\nIn addition to their print and digital-only products,\nThe Times\nand\nThe Sunday Times\nsell print and digital products bundled into one subscription, which is counted only once, under “print,” in the table above.\n(3)\nIncludes aggregate unique users accessing websites and mobile device and tablet apps based on Google Analytics data for the month ended June 30, 2021.

The\nPost\nis the oldest continuously published daily newspaper in the U.S., with a focus on coverage of the New York metropolitan area. The\nPost\nprovides a variety of general interest content ranging from breaking news to business analysis, and is known in particular for its comprehensive sports coverage, famous headlines and its iconic Page Six section, an authority on celebrity news. The print version of the\nPost\nis primarily distributed in New York, as well as throughout the Northeast, Florida and California. For the three months ended June 30, 2021, average weekday circulation based on internal sources, including mobile and tablet app digital editions, was 475,019. In addition, the Post Digital Network, which includes NYPost.com, PageSix.com and Decider.com, averaged approximately 139.2 million unique users per month during the quarter ended June 30, 2021 according to Google Analytics. See “Part I. Business—Explanatory Note Regarding Certain Metrics” for information regarding the calculation of unique users.\nThe News Media segment’s newspapers, magazines, digital publications, radio stations and podcasts generally face competition from similar sources, and compete on similar bases, as the consumer products within the Dow Jones segment, particularly in their respective operating geographies. See “Item 1. Business – Business Overview – Dow Jones” above for further information.\nOther\nThe Other segment includes the Company’s general corporate overhead expenses, costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters\nand transformation costs associated with the Company’s ongoing cost reduction initiatives\n.\n5\nPublishers Audience Measurement Company (“PAMCo”) report for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 was based on PAMCo print readership data for the 12 months ended March 31, 2020 and Comscore audience data for November 2020. PAMCo ceased conducting surveys of print readership in 2020 due to lockdown restrictions imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. UKOM, which sets the U.K. industry standard for online audience measurement, has appointed Ipsos as the provider of online audience measurement beginning in January 2021. Due to this transition, November 2020 represents the most recent audience data incorporated by PAMCo.\n10\nGovernmental Regulation\nGeneral\nVarious aspects of the Company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world. The introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the Company’s products and services are produced or distributed, and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries, could have a negative impact on the Company’s interests.\nAustralian Media Regulation\nThe Company’s subscription television interests are subject to Australia’s regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry, including the Australian Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) (the “Broadcasting Services Act”) and the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) (the “Telecommunications Act”) and associated Codes. The key regulatory body for the Australian broadcasting industry is the Australian Communications and Media Authority.\nKey regulatory issues for subscription television providers include: (a) anti-siphoning restrictions—currently under the ‘anti-siphoning’ provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act, subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the Olympic Games and certain Australian Rules football and cricket matches) unless national or commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 26 weeks before the start of the event or the rights are held by commercial television licensees whose television broadcasting services cover more than 50% of the Australian population or the rights are held by one of Australia’s two major government-funded broadcasters; and (b) other parts of the Broadcasting Services Act that may impact the Company’s ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities. Foxtel is also subject to various consumer protection regimes under the Telecommunications Act and associated Codes, which apply to Foxtel as a telecommunications service provider.\nData Privacy and Security\nThe Company’s business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed. For example, in the U.S., certain of the Company’s websites, mobile apps and other online business activities are subject to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, which prohibits the collection of personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission continues to expand its application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices, including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted internet advertisements. More state and local governments are also expanding, enacting or proposing data privacy laws that govern the collection and use of personal data of their residents and increase penalties and afford private rights of action to individuals in certain circumstances for failure to comply, and most states have enacted legislation requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which will amend the CCPA in January 2023, establish certain transparency rules, put greater restrictions on how the Company can collect, use and share personal information of California residents and provide California residents with certain rights regarding their personal information. The CCPA and forthcoming CPRA provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches. Similarly, the recently-enacted Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“CDPA”) imposes transparency and other obligations with respect to personal data of Virginia consumers and provides Virginia residents with similar rights, with the exception of a private right of action.\nSimilar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including the European Union, the U.K. and Australia. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which provides a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the European Union, and the U.K.\nadopted the Data Protection Act of 2018 (the “UK DPA”), implementing the GDPR\n. The GDPR and the UK DPA expand the regulation of the collection, processing, use, sharing and security of personal data, contain stringent conditions for consent from data subjects, strengthen the rights of individuals, including the right to have personal data deleted upon request, continue to restrict the trans-border flow of such data, require companies to conduct privacy impact assessments to evaluate data processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, require mandatory data breach reporting and notification, significantly increase maximum penalties for non-compliance (up to 20 million Euros or 17 million pounds, as applicable, or 4% of an entity’s worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher) and increase the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities. The European Union also plans to replace its existing e-Privacy Directive with a new e-Privacy Regulation that will complement the GDPR and amend certain rules, including with respect to cookies and other similar technologies that the Company utilizes to obtain information from visitors to the Company’s various digital\n11\nproperties. It is not yet clear whether the U.K. will make corresponding changes to its existing Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, which implemented the e-Privacy Directive in the U.K.\nThe Company and some of its service providers rely on certain mechanisms to address the European data protection requirements for transfers of data, such as the European Union Standard Contractual Clauses, that are evolving and often subject to uncertainty and legal challenges. In June 2021, the European Commission adopted new sets of European Union Standard Contractual Clauses, which regulate the relationship between controller and processor in accordance with the GDPR and international data transfers to a third country in the absence of an adequacy decision under the GDPR. The European Data Protection Board also adopted recommendations on measures that supplement data transfer tools to ensure compliance with the level of personal data protection required in Europe, including requirements for data exporters to assess the risks related to the transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area and to implement, if necessary, additional contractual, organizational and technical measures such as encryption and pseudonymization. Such evolving frameworks could cause the Company to incur additional costs, require it to change business practices or affect the manner in which it provides its services.\nIn Australia, data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by, among other things, requiring the disclosure of cross-border data transfers, placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and imposing mandatory data breach reporting, and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration.\nIndustry participants in the U.S., Europe and Australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industry-level standards and practices, including the implementation of self-regulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies, such as the Company, to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior.\nThe interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws are often uncertain, in flux, and evolving in the United States and internationally. Moreover, data privacy and security laws vary between local, state, federal and international jurisdictions and may potentially conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The Company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments, including any changes required in the Company’s data privacy and security compliance programs.\nU.K. Press Regulation\nAs a result of the implementation of recommendations of the Leveson inquiry into the U.K. press, a Press Recognition Panel responsible for approving, overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies was established. Once approved by the Press Recognition Panel, the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers. In addition to the Press Recognition Panel, certain legislation provides that publishers who are not members of an approved regulator may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded and, if Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 is commenced, the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances.\nPress regulator IMPRESS was recognized as an approved regulator by the Press Recognition Panel on October 25, 2016. However, publications representing the majority of the industry in the U.K., including News UK, entered into binding contracts to form an alternative regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, or IPSO, in September 2014. IPSO currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the Press Recognition Panel. IPSO has an independent chairman and a 12-member board, the majority of which are independent. IPSO oversees the Editors’ Code of Practice, requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires self-reporting of any failures, provides a complaints handling service, has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the Editors’ Code of Practice and levy fines of up to £1 million. IPSO has also introduced an arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications. The burdens IPSO imposes on its print media members, including the Company’s newspaper publishing businesses in the U.K., may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance.\nU.K. Radio Broadcasting Regulation\nThe Company’s radio stations in the U.K. and Ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the Company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations. Although the Company expects its licenses will, where relevant, be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Non-compliance by the Company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations, including of the relevant authority, could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions.\n12\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company’s intellectual property assets include: copyrights in newspapers, books, video programming and other content and technologies; trademarks in names and logos; trade names; domain names; and licenses of intellectual property rights. These licenses include: (1) the sports programming rights licenses for the National Rugby League, Australian Football League, Cricket Australia, V8 Supercars, Formula One and other broadcasting rights described in Note 16 to the Financial Statements; (2) licenses from various third parties of patents and other technology for the set-top boxes and related operating and conditional access systems used in the Company’s subscription television business; (3) the trademark license for the realtor.com\n®\nwebsite address, as well as the REALTOR\n®\ntrademark (the “NAR License”); and (4) the trademark licenses for the use of FOX formative trademarks used in the Company’s pay-TV business in Australia (the “Fox Licenses”). In addition, its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations. The Company derives value and revenue from its intellectual property assets through, among other things, print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales, subscriptions to its pay-TV services and distribution and/or licensing of its television programming to other television services, the sale, distribution and/or licensing of print and digital books, the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services and the operation of websites and other digital properties.\nThe Company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the U.S., the U.K., Australia and other foreign territories. To protect these assets, the Company relies upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. Piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. Policing unauthorized use of the Company’s products, services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the Company’s intellectual property. The Company seeks to limit the threat of piracy by, among other means, preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption, signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software, as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions. The Company also seeks to limit such threat to its intellectual property by pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. However, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Therefore, the Company also engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement.\nThird parties may challenge the validity or scope of the Company’s intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations.\nRaw Materials\nAs a major publisher of newspapers, magazines and books, the Company utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. In order to obtain the best available prices, substantially all of the Company’s paper purchasing is done on a regional, volume purchase basis, and draws upon major paper manufacturing countries around the world. The Company believes that under present market conditions, its sources of paper supply used in its publishing activities are adequate.\nHuman Capital\nNews Corp provides communities with the news, information and entertainment they need and demand, and its workforce is critical to the creation and delivery of its premium and trusted content and the success of the company. The Company’s ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees with the skills and capabilities needed by its businesses is a key component of its long-term strategy to become more global and more digital.\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Company had approximately 24,000 employees, of whom approximately 8,500 were located in the U.S., 5,000 were located in the U.K. and 7,500 were located in Australia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company transitioned approximately 90% of its employees to remote working, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. Of the Company’s employees, approximately 4,500 were represented by various employee unions. The contracts with such unions will expire during various times over the next several years. The Company believes its current relationships with employees are generally good.\n13\nThe capabilities of the Company’s workforce have continued to evolve along with the Company’s business and strategy, including becoming more digital. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the pace of this evolution increased, as changing consumer behavior accelerated the shift in the Company’s workforce allocation towards digital products and services. The Company also implemented a transformation initiative to streamline operations and reduce costs across back office functions, including the introduction of common technology platforms, standardizing internal processes, outsourcing various activities and rationalizing its real estate footprint, which it expects to increase collaboration across its businesses worldwide and optimize the productivity and efficiency of its workforce.\nCulture and Values\nThe delivery of quality news, information and entertainment to customers is a passionate, principled and purposeful enterprise. The Company believes people around the globe turn to News Corp because they trust its dedication to those values and to conducting business with integrity. The Company is always mindful that one of its greatest assets is its reputation, and ethical conduct is part of the vision, strategy and fabric of the Company. The Company has established a Compliance Steering Committee that oversees the Company’s global compliance-related policies, protocols and guidance and reports directly to the Board of Directors through the Audit Committee. Performance on ethics and compliance objectives is evaluated in determining the payout of incentive compensation for executive officers. In addition, all employees are required to regularly complete training on, and affirm compliance with, the News Corp Standards of Business Conduct, which confirm the Company’s policy to conduct its affairs in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and observe the highest standards of business ethics. The Standards of Business Conduct are reviewed regularly and approved by the Board of Directors, and are complemented by business-unit and topic-specific policies and trainings, including with respect to workplace conduct, conflicts of interest, anti-corruption and anti-bribery and insider trading.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nThe Company recognizes that the unique experiences and perspectives of its employees across its various businesses are critical to creating brands and products that reflect a diversity of viewpoints and engage and inspire customers all over the world, and the Company seeks to foster an environment where all employees can feel valued, included and empowered to bring great ideas to the table. To achieve this, the Company is committed to cultivating diversity and broadening opportunities for inclusion across its businesses. As of December 31, 2020, women represented 48% of News Corp’s global workforce, 40% of its senior executives\n6\nand 33% of its Board of Directors. Although the Company has made progress in its workforce diversity representation, it seeks to continuously improve in this area through its recruitment practices, employee development and mentoring and inclusivity programs, and all of the Company’s business units have implemented diversity and inclusion programs and practices tailored to their respective industries and geographies. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors assesses the Company’s progress towards its diversity and inclusion objectives on an annual basis and reports on its review to the Board of Directors.\nCompensation and Benefits\nNews Corp’s compensation and benefits programs, which vary based on business unit and geographic location, are focused on attracting, retaining and motivating the top talent necessary to achieve its mission in ways that reflect its diverse global workforce’s needs and priorities. In addition to competitive salaries, the Company and its businesses have established short- and long-term incentive programs designed to motivate and reward performance against key business objectives and facilitate retention. News Corp also provides a range of retirement benefits based on competitive regional benchmarks and other comprehensive benefit options to meet the needs of its employees, including healthcare benefits, tax advantaged savings vehicles, life and disability insurance, paid time off, flexible working arrangements, generous parental leave policies and a company match for charitable donations. To support their employees through the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of business units provided enhanced benefits and implemented additional wellness programs, such as: the launch of a Community Online Academy, which offers free virtual classes weekly to help employees and their families improve their physical and mental well-being, as well as flexible work schedules, home office equipment reimbursements, enhanced child care benefits and ClassPass at Home, through which employees can access free live-streaming and on-demand exercise programs.\nTraining and Development\nNews Corp invests significant resources in training and development programs designed to enable its employees to develop the skills and leadership necessary to execute on the Company’s strategy and engage and retain top talent. News Corp employees\n6\nComprising the Company’s Executive Chairman, Chief Executive, headquarters leadership team and chief executive officers of its primary operating companies, and executives directly reporting to each of the foregoing.\n14\nhave access to a range of training opportunities, including workshops and classes on a variety of topics, webinars, job-specific training and other continuing education resources. The Company further supports and develops its employees through career planning resources and programs that build and strengthen employee leadership skills. In addition, the Company and its businesses have implemented programs to support regular performance reviews for employees to highlight their strengths and identify the skills and growth areas necessary to advance their careers. These programs help the Company identify and invest in the next generation of leadership and represent an important component in the development of its talent pipeline.\nExplanatory Note Regarding Certain Metrics\nUnique Users\nFor purposes of this Annual Report, the Company counts unique users the first time an individual accesses a product’s website using a browser during a calendar month and the first time an individual accesses a product’s mobile or tablet app using a mobile or tablet device during a calendar month. If the user accesses more than one of a product’s desktop websites, mobile websites, mobile apps and/or tablet apps, the first access to each such website or app is counted as a separate unique user. In addition, users accessing a product’s websites through different browsers, users who clear their browser cache at any time and users who access a product’s websites and apps through different devices are also counted as separate unique users. For a group of products such as WSJDN, a user accessing different products within the group is counted as a separate unique user for each product accessed.\nBroadcast Subscribers\nBroadcast subscribers consist of residential subscribers and commercial subscribers, which are calculated as described below.\nResidential Subscribers\nTotal number of residential subscribers represents total residential subscribers to the Company’s pay-TV services through cable and satellite distribution, including subscribers obtained through third-party distribution relationships.\nCommercial Subscribers\nCommercial subscribers for the Company’s pay-TV business are calculated as residential equivalent business units, which are derived by dividing total recurring revenue from these subscribers by an estimated average Broadcast ARPU which is held constant through the year. Total number of commercial subscribers represents total commercial subscribers to the Company’s pay-TV services through cable and satellite distribution, including subscribers obtained through third-party distribution relationships.\nBroadcast ARPU\nThe Company calculates Broadcast ARPU for its pay-TV business by dividing broadcast package revenues for the period, net of customer credits, promotions and other discounts, by average cable and satellite residential subscribers for the period and dividing by the number of months in the period. Average cable and satellite residential subscribers, or “Average Broadcast Subscribers,” for a given period is calculated by first adding the beginning and ending cable and satellite residential subscribers for each month in the period and dividing by two and then adding each of those monthly average subscriber numbers and dividing by the number of months in the period.\nBroadcast Subscriber Churn\nThe Company calculates Broadcast Subscriber Churn for its pay-TV business by dividing the total number of disconnected cable and satellite residential subscribers for the period, net of reconnects and transfers, by the Average Broadcast Subscribers for the period, calculated as described above. This amount is then divided by the number of days in the period and multiplied by 365 days to present churn on an annual basis.\nPaid Subscribers\nA paid subscriber to the Company’s streaming services is one for which the Company recognized subscription revenue. A subscriber ceases to be a paid subscriber as of their effective cancellation date or as a result of a failed payment method. Paid subscribers excludes customers receiving service for no charge under certain new subscriber promotions.\n15"

    "text": "You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating the Company and its common stock. Any of the following risks, or other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial, could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition, and could, in turn, impact the trading price of the Company’s common stock.\nRisks Relating to the Company’s Businesses and Operations\nThe Company Operates in a Highly Competitive Business Environment, and its Success Depends on its Ability to Compete Effectively, Including by Responding to Evolving Technologies and Changes in Consumer and Customer Behavior.\nThe Company faces significant competition from other providers of news, information, entertainment and real estate-related services, including both traditional and new providers. See “Business Overview” for more information regarding competition within each of the Company’s segments. This competition continues to intensify as a result of changes in technologies, platforms and business models and corresponding changes in consumer and customer behavior, and the Company may be adversely affected if consumers or customers migrate to other alternatives. For example, enhanced internet capabilities, developments in content distribution platforms and the emergence of new media channels have led to alternative methods for the delivery, storage and consumption of content, which have increased the number of choices available to consumers for content consumption and have, in turn, adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, demand for the Company’s newspapers, television programs and other products and services and the price consumers are willing to pay. Consumption of the Company’s content on third-party delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control, loss of a direct relationship with consumers and lower engagement and subscription rates. These trends and developments have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, both the Company’s circulation and subscription revenue and, in turn, advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from the Company, as well as increase subscriber acquisition, retention and other costs.\nTechnological developments have in some cases also increased competition by lowering barriers to entry. For example, content providers are now able to compete more easily with the Company’s pay-TV business via direct-to-consumer offerings, as internet streaming capabilities have enabled the disaggregation of content delivery from the ownership of network infrastructure. Other digital platforms and technologies, such as user-generated content platforms and self-publishing tools, have also reduced the effort and expense of producing and distributing certain types of content on a wide scale, allowing digital content providers, customers, suppliers and other third parties to compete with the Company, often at a lower cost. Additional digital distribution channels, such as online retailers and digital marketplaces, have presented, and may continue to present, challenges to the Company’s business models, including its traditional book publishing model, which could adversely affect sales volume and/or pricing.\nIn order to compete effectively, the Company must differentiate and distinguish its brands and their associated products and services, respond to and develop new technologies, distribution channels and platforms, products and services and anticipate and consistently respond to changes in consumer and customer needs, tastes and behavior, which in turn, depends on many factors both within and beyond its control. For example, the Company relies on brand awareness, reputation and acceptance of its high-quality differentiated content and other products and services, the breadth, depth and accuracy of information provided by its digital real estate services and professional information businesses, as well as its wide array of digital offerings, in order to retain and grow its audiences, consumers and subscribers. However, consumer tastes change frequently and are difficult to predict, and when faced with a multitude of choices, consumers may place greater value on the convenience and price of content and other products and services than they do on their source, quality or reliability. Online traffic and product and service purchases are also driven by internet search results, referrals from social media and other platforms and visibility on digital marketplace platforms and in mobile app stores. Search engine results and digital marketplace and mobile app store rankings are based on algorithms that are changed frequently, and social media and other platforms may also vary their emphasis on what content to highlight for users. Any failure to successfully manage and adapt to these changes across the Company’s businesses, including those affecting how the Company’s content, apps, products and services are discovered, prioritized, displayed and monetized, could impede the Company’s ability to compete effectively by significantly decreasing traffic to the Company’s digital properties, lowering advertiser interest in those properties, increasing costs if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic and lowering product sales and subscriptions. A shortfall in the expected popularity or discoverability of the Company’s content or other products and services could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company expects to continue to pursue new strategic initiatives and develop new and enhanced products and services in order to remain competitive, such as its streaming services, its recently launched transformation initiative and the continued expansion into various adjacencies at its digital real estate services businesses. The Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, significant costs in order to implement these strategies and develop these new products and services, including\n16\ncosts to continue developing and improving its streaming services and costs related to its transformation initiative, as well as other costs to acquire, develop, adopt, upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies and attract and retain employees with the necessary knowledge and skills. There can be no assurance any strategic initiatives, products and services will be successful in the manner or time period or at the cost the Company expects or that it will realize the anticipated benefits it expects to achieve. The failure to realize those benefits could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of the Company’s current and potential competitors may have greater resources, fewer regulatory burdens, better competitive positions in certain areas, greater operating capabilities, greater access to sources of content, data, technology or other services or strategic relationships and/or easier access to financing, which may allow them to respond more effectively to changes in technology, consumer and customer needs, preferences and behavior and market conditions. Continued consolidation among competitors in certain industries in which the Company operates may increase these advantages, including through greater scale, financial leverage and/or access to content, data, technology and other offerings. If the Company is unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors, its business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nA Decline in Customer Advertising Expenditures in the Company’s Newspaper and Other Businesses Could Cause its Revenues and Operating Results to Decline Significantly.\nThe Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising, and its ability to generate advertising revenue is dependent on a number of factors, including: (1) demand for the Company’s products and services, (2) audience fragmentation, (3) digital advertising trends, (4) its ability to offer advertising products and formats sought by advertisers, (5) general economic and business conditions, (6) demographics of the customer base, (7) advertising rates, (8) advertising effectiveness and (9) maintaining its brand strength and reputation.\nDemand for the Company’s products and services is evaluated based on a variety of metrics. For example, circulation levels for the Company’s newspapers, ratings points for its cable channels and number of listeners for its radio stations are among the factors advertisers consider when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the Company as well as advertising rates. For the Company’s digital media properties, advertisers evaluate consumer demand using metrics such as the number of visits, number of users and user engagement. Any difficulty or failure in accurately measuring demand, particularly demand generated through new platforms, may lead to under-measurement and, in turn, lower advertising pricing and spending.\nThe popularity of digital media among consumers as a source of news, entertainment and other content, and the ability of digital advertising offerings to deliver targeted advertising promptly, has driven a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional channels to digital platforms. Large digital platforms in particular, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, which have extensive audience reach, audience data and targeting capabilities, have commanded an increasing share of the digital advertising market in recent years, and the Company expects this trend to continue. The shift to digital media has significantly impacted the Company’s print advertising revenues, which have declined in each of its last three fiscal years. New devices and technologies, as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media platforms such as online and mobile social networking, have also increased the number of media choices and formats available to audiences, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising. The range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising. In addition, in the past, rates have been generally lower for mobile advertising than for desktop advertising. As a result, increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices has added, and may continue to add, additional pricing pressure. Consequently, despite continued growth in the Company’s digital advertising revenues, such revenues may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption.\nThe digital advertising market also continues to undergo changes that may further impact digital advertising revenues. Programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale play a significant role in the advertising marketplace and have caused and may continue to cause further downward pricing pressure. New third-party delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control, loss of a direct relationship with consumers and adversely affect the Company’s ability to understand its audience and/or collect and apply data for targeted advertising. The Company’s digital advertising operations also rely on a small number of significant technologies such as Google’s ad manager which, if interrupted or meaningfully changed, or if the providers leverage their power to alter the economic structure, could adversely impact advertising revenues. In addition, evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising, as well as the development and implementation of technology, regulations, policies and practices that adversely affect the Company’s ability to deliver, target or measure the effectiveness of its advertising, including blocking, changing the location of, or obscuring, the display of advertising on websites and mobile devices, browsing incognito, blocking or deleting cookies and IP addresses, the phase-out of browser\n17\nsupport for third party cookies and mobile operating system identifiers used for advertising purposes, as well as opt-in requirements, may also negatively impact digital advertising revenues. As the digital advertising market continues to evolve, the Company’s ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on, among other things, its ability to drive scale, engage and grow digital audiences, collect and leverage better user data, develop new digital advertising products and formats such as branded and other custom content, and video and mobile advertising, and demonstrate the value of its advertising and the effectiveness of the Company’s platforms to its advertising customers, including through more targeted, data-driven offerings.\nThe Company’s print and digital advertising revenue is also affected generally by overall national and local economic and business conditions, which tend to be cyclical, as well as election and other news cycles. Natural disasters, including extreme weather, pandemics (including the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic) and other widespread health crises or acts of terrorism have led and could continue to lead to greater economic uncertainty and reduced spending by advertisers. The Company experienced a material negative impact on advertising revenues primarily in the first half of fiscal 2021 because of weakness in the advertising market due to COVID-19. In addition, certain sectors of the economy account for a significant portion of the Company’s advertising revenues, including retail, technology and finance. Some of these sectors, such as retail, are more sensitive to weakness in economic conditions, as well as increased online competition. A decline in the economic prospects of these and other advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries, which may reduce the Company’s overall advertising revenue.\nWhile the Company has adopted a number of strategies and initiatives to address these challenges, there can be no guarantee that its efforts will be successful. If the Company is unable to demonstrate the continuing value of its various platforms and high-quality content and brands or offer advertisers unique multi-platform advertising programs, its results may suffer. Reduced demand for the Company’s offerings, a decrease in advertising expenditures by the Company’s customers or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Inability to Obtain and Retain Sports, Entertainment and Other Programming Rights and Content Could Adversely Affect the Revenue of Certain of the Company’s Operating Businesses, and Costs Could Also Increase Upon Renewal.\nCompetition for popular programming licensed from third parties is intense, and the success of certain of the Company’s operating businesses, including its subscription television business, depends on, among other things, their ability to obtain and retain rights to desirable programming and certain related elements thereof, such as music rights, that enable them to deliver content to subscribers and audiences in the manner in which they wish to consume it and at competitive prices. The subscription television industry, including the Company’s subscription television business, has experienced higher programming costs due to, among other things, (1) increases imposed by sports, entertainment and other programmers when offering new programming or upon the expiration of existing contracts; (2) the carriage of incremental programming, including new services and SVOD programming; and (3) increased competition from other digital media companies, including streaming services, for the rights to popular or exclusive content. Certain of the Company’s operating businesses, including its subscription television business, are party to contracts for sports, entertainment and other programming rights with various third parties, including professional sports leagues and teams, television and motion picture producers and other content providers. These contracts have varying durations and renewal terms, and as they expire, renewals on favorable terms may be sought. In the course of renegotiating these and other agreements as they expire, the financial and other terms, such as exclusivity rights, under these contracts may change as a result of various reasons beyond the Company’s control, such as changes in the Company’s bargaining power or in the industry, and in order to retain or extend such rights, the Company may be required to increase the value of its offer to amounts that substantially exceed the existing contract costs. Furthermore, third parties may outbid the Company for those rights and/or for any new programming offerings. In addition, as other content providers develop their own competing services, they may be unwilling to provide the Company with access to certain content. For example, professional sports leagues or teams, as well as programmers and distributors such as ViacomCBS and Disney, have created and may continue to create their own direct-to-consumer offerings. Further, consolidation among content providers may increase the amount of content that could become unavailable to the Company and/or increase the scale and bargaining power of those providers. The loss of rights or any adverse changes to existing rights, including loss of exclusivity, may adversely affect the Company’s ability to differentiate its services and the breadth or quality of the Company’s content offerings, including the extent of the sports coverage and the availability of other popular entertainment programming offered by the Company, and lead to customer or audience dissatisfaction or, in some cases, loss of customers or audiences, which could, in turn, adversely affect its revenues. In addition, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if upon renewal, escalations in programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates. The long-term nature of some of the Company’s content commitments may also limit its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, business and economic conditions and the market segments in which it operates.\n18\nThe Company Has Made and May Continue to Make Strategic Acquisitions, Investments and Divestitures That Introduce Significant Risks and Uncertainties.\nIn order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities, the Company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that involve significant risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, among others: (1) the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses, operations and systems, including financial reporting, internal controls and information technology, in an efficient and effective manner, (2) the challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits, (3) the potential loss of key employees, customers and suppliers, (4) with respect to investments, risks associated with the inability to control the operations of the business, (5) the risk of diverting the attention of the Company’s senior management from the Company’s operations, (6) in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments, the impact of specific economic, tax, currency, political, legal and regulatory risks associated with the relevant countries, (7) expenses and liabilities, both known and unknown, associated with the acquired businesses or investments, (8) in some cases, increased regulation and (9) in some cases, lower liquidity as a result of the use of cash or incurrence of debt to fund such acquisition or investment. If any acquired business or investment fails to operate as anticipated or an acquired business cannot be successfully integrated with the Company’s existing businesses, the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation could be adversely affected, and the Company may be required to record non-cash impairment charges for the write-down of certain acquired assets and investments. The Company’s ability to continue to make acquisitions depends on the availability of suitable candidates at acceptable prices and whether restrictions are imposed by regulations, and competition for certain types of acquisitions is significant.\nThe Company has also divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with its strategic direction or growth targets. Divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. These include, among others, the inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms, disruption to its business and/or diversion of management attention from other business concerns, loss of key employees, difficulties in separating the operations of the divested business, retention of certain liabilities related to the divested business and indemnification or other post-closing claims.\nThe Company’s Pay-TV Business Depends on a Single or Limited Number of Suppliers for Certain Key Products and Services,\nand Any Reduction or Interruption in the Supply of These Products and Services or a Significant Increase in Price Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company’s Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nThe Company’s pay-TV business depends on a single or limited number of third party suppliers to supply certain key products and services necessary to provide its pay-TV services. In particular, the Company depends on Optus to provide all of its satellite transponder capacity and CommScope and Jonsa to supply its set-top boxes, and the Company expects its reliance on these suppliers to increase as it continues to migrate broadcast subscribers to satellite or internet delivery over the next several years. If any of these suppliers breaches or terminates its agreement with the Company or otherwise fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner, experiences operating or financial difficulties, is unable to meet demand due to component shortages, insufficient capacity or otherwise, significantly increases the amount the Company pays for necessary products or services or ceases production of any necessary product, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, Telstra is the primary supplier of cable distribution capacity for the Company’s pay-TV programming and is also currently the exclusive provider of wholesale fixed voice and broadband services for the Company’s pay-TV business and the largest reseller of its cable and satellite products. Any disruption in the supply of those services or a decline in Telstra’s business could result in disruptions to the supply of, and/or reduce the number of subscribers for, the Company’s products and services, which could, in turn, adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company will seek alternative sources for the products and services described above where possible and/or permissible under applicable agreements, it may not be able to develop these alternative sources quickly and cost-effectively, which could impair its ability to timely deliver its products and services to its subscribers or operate its business.\nThe Company’s International Operations Expose it to Additional Risks that Could Adversely Affect its Business, Operating Results and Financial Condition.\nIn its fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, approximately 63% of the Company’s revenues were derived outside the U.S., and the Company is focused on expanding the international scope of its operations. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally and other risks may be heightened, including (1) issues related to managing international operations; (2) economic uncertainties and volatility in local markets and political or social instability; (3) the impact of catastrophic events in relevant\n19\njurisdictions such as natural disasters, including extreme weather (which may occur with increasing frequency and intensity), pandemics (including COVID-19) and other widespread health crises or acts of terrorism; (4) compliance with international laws, regulations and policies, including foreign tax regimes and potential adverse changes thereto, foreign ownership restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange, data privacy requirements such as the GDPR, foreign intellectual property laws and local labor and employment laws and regulations; (5) compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act; and (6) increasing regulatory or governmental action against the Company’s products and services such as censorship or other restrictions on access, expulsion of journalists or other employees and other retaliatory actions, including as a result of trade and other disputes with the U.S. For example, Brexit may continue to adversely affect, among other things, economic and market conditions in the U.K. and the European Union, create uncertainty around doing business in the U.K. and result in additional costs and compliance obligations, including with respect to tariffs and other trade barriers, data protection and transfer, tax rates and the recruitment and retention of employees. Events or developments related to these and other risks associated with the Company’s international operations could result in reputational harm and have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Challenges associated with operating globally may increase as the Company continues to expand into geographic areas that it believes represent the highest growth opportunities.\nThe Company is Party to Agreements with Third Parties Relating to Certain of its Businesses That Contain Operational and Management Restrictions and/or Other Rights That, Depending on the Circumstances, May Not be in the Best Interest of the Company.\nThe Company is party to agreements with third parties relating to certain of its businesses that restrict the Company’s ability to take specified actions and contain other rights that, depending on the circumstances, may not be in the best interest of the Company. For example, the Company and Telstra are parties to a Shareholders’ Agreement with respect to Foxtel containing certain minority protections for Telstra, including standard governance provisions, as well as transfer and exit rights. The Shareholders’ Agreement provides Telstra with the right to appoint two directors to the Board of Foxtel, as well as Board and shareholder-level veto rights over certain non-ordinary course and/or material corporate actions that may prevent Foxtel from taking actions that are in the interests of the Company. The Shareholders’ Agreement also provides for (1) certain transfer restrictions, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to effect such transfers and/or the prices at which those transfers may occur, and (2) exit arrangements, which could, in certain circumstances, force the Company to sell its interest, subject to rights of first and, in some cases, last refusals.\nIn addition, Move, the Company’s digital real estate services business in the U.S., operates the realtor.com\n®\nwebsite under an agreement with NAR that is perpetual in duration. However, NAR may terminate the operating agreement for certain contractually-specified reasons upon expiration of applicable cure periods. If the operating agreement with NAR is terminated, the NAR License would also terminate, and Move would be required to transfer a copy of the software that operates the realtor.com\n®\nwebsite to NAR and provide NAR with copies of its agreements with advertisers and data content providers. NAR would then be able to operate a realtor.com\n®\nwebsite, either by itself or with another third party.\nDamage, Failure or Destruction of Satellites and Transmitter Facilities that the Company’s Pay-TV Business Depends Upon to Distribute its Programming Could Adversely Affect the Company’s Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nThe Company’s pay-TV business uses satellite systems to transmit its programming to its subscribers and/or authorized sublicensees. The Company’s distribution facilities include uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks, and the Company also uses studio and transmitter facilities. Transmissions may be disrupted or degraded as a result of local disasters, including extreme weather (which may occur with increasing frequency and intensity), power outages, terrorist attacks, cyberattacks or other similar events, that damage or destroy on-ground uplinks or downlinks or studio and transmitter facilities, or as a result of damage to a satellite. Satellites are subject to significant operational and environmental risks while in orbit, including anomalies resulting from various factors such as manufacturing defects and problems with power or control systems, as well as environmental hazards such as meteoroid events, electrostatic storms and collisions with space debris. These events may result in the loss of one or more transponders on a satellite or the entire satellite and/or reduce the useful life of the satellite, which could, in turn, lead to a disruption or loss of video services to the Company’s customers. The Company does not carry commercial insurance for business disruptions or losses resulting from the foregoing events as it believes the cost of insurance premiums is uneconomical relative to the risk. Instead, the Company seeks to mitigate this risk through the maintenance of backup satellite capacity and other contingency plans. However, these steps may not be sufficient, and if the Company is unable to secure alternate distribution, studio and/or transmission facilities in a timely manner, any such disruption or loss could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n20\nThe Loss of Key Personnel, or the Failure to Attract and Retain Other Highly Qualified Personnel, Could Harm the Company’s Business.\nThe Company’s businesses depend upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of its corporate and divisional executive teams and other highly qualified employees who possess substantial business, technical and operational knowledge. The market for highly skilled personnel, including for technology-related, product development, data science, marketing and sales roles, is very competitive, and the Company cannot ensure that it will be successful in retaining these employees or hiring and training suitable additions or replacements without significant costs or delays, particularly as its focus on digital products and services increases. These risks may be further exacerbated by changes in the nature of the office environment and remote working as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly if the Company’s needs are not aligned with increased demand for flexible work arrangements or as a result of workplace culture challenges due to increased remote working. The loss of key employees, or the failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel, could harm the Company’s business, including the ability to execute its business strategy.\nAny Significant Increase in Newsprint Costs or Disruption in the Company’s Newsprint Supply Chain or Newspaper Printing and Distribution Channels may Adversely Affect the Company’s Business, Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nNewsprint is a significant expense for the Company’s newspaper publishing units. The price of newsprint has historically been volatile, and a number of factors may cause prices to increase, including: (1) the closure and consolidation of newsprint mills or the conversion of newsprint mills to other products or grades of paper, which has reduced the number of newsprint suppliers over the years; (2) the imposition of tariffs or other restrictions on non-U.S. suppliers of paper; (3) an increase in supplier operating expenses due to rising raw material or energy costs or other factors; (4) failure to maintain the Company’s current consumption levels; and (5) the inability to maintain the Company’s existing relationships with its newsprint suppliers. The Company also relies on third party suppliers for deliveries of newsprint and on third-party printing and distribution partners to print and distribute its newspapers in a number of key areas, including printing of the\nWall Street Journal\n, the\nNew York Post\nand\nBarron’s\nin New York. Financial pressures, newspaper industry economics, labor unrest, changes in laws and regulations, trucking shortages, ocean freight and customs delays and other transportation issues, natural disasters, including extreme weather (which may occur with increasing frequency and intensity), pandemics and other widespread health crises or other circumstances affecting these third-party suppliers and print and distribution partners could lead to disruptions, reduced operations or consolidations within the Company’s newsprint supply chain and/or of third-party print sites and/or distribution routes. The Company may not be able to develop alternative providers quickly and cost-effectively, which could disrupt printing and distribution operations or increase the cost of printing and distributing the Company’s newspapers. Any significant increase in the cost of newsprint, undersupply or significant disruptions in the newsprint supply chain or newspaper printing and distribution channels could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is Subject to Payment Processing Risk Which Could Lead to Adverse Effects on the Company’s Business and Results of Operations.\nThe Company’s customers pay for its products and services using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, direct debit, online wallets and through direct carrier and partner billing. The Company relies on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees, material changes in the payment ecosystem, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, any failures to comply with, or changes to, rules or regulations concerning payments, loss of payment or billing partners and/or disruptions or failures in, or fraudulent use of or access to, payment processing systems or payment products, the Company’s results of operations could be adversely impacted and it could suffer reputational harm. Furthermore, if the Company is unable to maintain its fraud and chargeback rates at acceptable levels, card networks may impose fines and its card approval rate may be impacted. The termination of the Company’s ability to process payments on any major payment method would adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nLabor Disputes May Have an Adverse Effect on the Company’s Business.\nIn a variety of the Company’s businesses, it engages the services of employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. If the Company is unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins.\n21\nMacroeconomic and Market Risks\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic and Other Similar Epidemics, Pandemics or Widespread Health Crises Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company’s Business, Results of Operations, Cash Flows and Financial Position.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and the resulting responses of governments, businesses and consumers, have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. The COVID-19 pandemic led to the implementation of unprecedented and wide-ranging measures by international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of the virus, including quarantines, shelter-in-place and other social distancing orders, event cancellations, travel restrictions and orders for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures to prevent its spread caused significant and prolonged unemployment and a decline in consumer confidence and created significant economic volatility, uncertainty and disruption. Other epidemics, pandemics or widespread health crises may have similar effects.\nDuring fiscal 2021, particularly in the first half, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact the Company’s businesses, although the impacts moderated relative to fiscal 2020. For example, business restrictions and shelter-in-place orders caused a decline in print newspaper volumes, while postponements and cancellations of sports events negatively impacted commercial subscription revenues and broadcast and Kayo subscribers. Advertising revenues also declined due to the resulting economic downturn. While the Company saw growth in other areas, including digital subscribers at its newspaper businesses, book sales at its Book Publishing segment and audience growth at realtor.com\n®\n, driven in part by pandemic-related circumstances and the news environment, this growth may not be sustainable.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company instituted remote working arrangements for a substantial majority of its employees. While these arrangements have not materially affected the Company’s ability to maintain its business operations to date, these work arrangements could, in the future, strain the Company’s business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including cybersecurity risks or risks to the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls, and affect the Company’s productivity and ability to manage its business and perform critical functions.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other similar epidemics, pandemics or widespread health crises will depend on, among other things, the severity, duration, spread and any reoccurrence of such crises, the impact of governmental actions and business and consumer behavior in response, the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate outbreaks and prevent or limit any reoccurrence, including the development, availability and public acceptance of effective treatments and vaccines, the resulting global economic conditions and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and other similar epidemics, pandemics or widespread health crises may amplify many of the other risk factors disclosed elsewhere in this “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nWeak Domestic and Global Economic Conditions and Volatility and Disruption in the Financial and Other Markets May Adversely Affect the Company’s Business.\nThe U.S. and global economies have undergone, and may in the future experience, periods of economic and market weakness and uncertainty, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, trade disputes between a number of countries and higher inflation. These conditions have resulted in, among other things, a tightening of, and in some cases more limited access to, the credit and capital markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, lower consumer and business spending, lower consumer net worth and a decline in the real estate market. Such weakness and uncertainty and associated market disruptions have often led to broader, prolonged economic downturns that have historically resulted in lower advertising expenditures, lower demand for the Company’s products and services and unfavorable changes in the mix of products and services purchased and have adversely affected the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Any continued or recurring economic weakness is likely to have a similar impact on the Company’s business and reduce its circulation and subscription, advertising, real estate, consumer and other revenues and otherwise negatively impact the performance of its businesses. The Company is particularly exposed to certain Australian business risks, including specific Australian legal and regulatory risks, consumer preferences and competition, because it holds a substantial amount of Australian assets and generated approximately 42% of its fiscal 2021 revenues from Australia. As a result, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by negative developments in the Australian market, including, for example, weakness in the Australian residential real estate market which has led, and may in the future lead, to lower listing volumes at REA Group. The Company also generated approximately 14% of its fiscal 2021 revenues from the U.K., which continues to experience political, regulatory, economic and market uncertainty following its exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” While the U.K. and the European Union have entered into a trade and cooperation agreement,\n22\nwhich provides a framework for the U.K.’s future relationship with the European Union, significant political and economic uncertainty remains as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation. The impact on the Company’s business of any treaties, laws and regulations that replace the existing European Union counterparts, or other governmental or regulatory actions taken by the U.K. or the European Union in connection with or subsequent to Brexit, cannot be predicted, including whether or not regulators will continue to approve or impose material conditions on the Company’s business activities. In addition, Brexit may lead to a downturn in the U.K. or other European economies and could lead to lower access to European markets, in general. Any of these effects, and others the Company cannot anticipate, could have a material adverse effect on its businesses in the U.K. and elsewhere.\nIn addition, further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the Company to obtain financing or refinance its existing indebtedness. These conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the Company does business to satisfy their obligations to the Company, including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms. Although the Company believes that its cash on hand, operating cash flow and current access to credit and capital markets, including the Company’s revolving credit facility, will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for at least the next 12 months, there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global credit and capital markets will not impair the Company’s liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing.\nFluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company’s Results of Operations.\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its consolidated debt when the debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support the ability to repay or refinance such debt. As of June 30, 2021, the Foxtel operating subsidiaries, whose functional currency is Australian dollars, had approximately $354 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company’s policy is to hedge against the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements with respect to this exposure where commercially reasonable. However, there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all, or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties to those arrangements.\nIn addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency translation risk because it has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in currencies other than the Company’s reporting currency, primarily the Australian dollar and the British pound sterling. Since the Company’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, a currency translation impact on the Company’s earnings when the results of those operations that are reported in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on its reported results of operations in a given period or in specific markets.\nRisks Related to Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Data Protection\nThe Company Relies on Network and Information Systems and Other Technology Whose Failure or Misuse Could Cause a Disruption of Services or Loss, Improper Access to or Disclosure of Personal Data, Business Information, Including Intellectual Property, or Other Confidential Information, Resulting in Increased Costs, Loss of Revenue, Reputational Damage or Other Harm to the Company’s Business.\nNetwork and information systems and other technologies, including those related to the Company’s content delivery networks and network management, are important to its business activities and contain the Company’s proprietary, confidential and sensitive business information, including personal data of its customers and personnel. The Company also relies on third party providers for certain technology and “cloud-based” systems and services that support a variety of business operations. Network and information systems-related events affecting the Company’s systems, or those of third parties upon which the Company’s business relies, such as computer compromises, cyber threats and attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, ransomware and denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities by individuals or state-sponsored or other groups, or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power and internet outages, equipment failure, natural disasters, including extreme weather (which may occur with increasing frequency and intensity), terrorist activities, war, human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems, could result in disruption of the Company’s services and business and/or loss, corruption, improper access to or disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. Unauthorized parties may also fraudulently induce the Company’s employees or other agents to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to the Company’s systems, facilities or data, or those of third parties with whom the Company does business. In addition, any design or manufacturing defects in, or the improper implementation of, hardware or software applications the Company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly disrupt the Company’s network and information systems or compromise information security. System redundancy may be\n23\nineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s disaster recovery and business continuity planning may not be sufficient to address all potential cyber events or other disruptions.\nIn recent years, there has been a significant rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies’ network and information systems, and such attacks are becoming increasingly more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work and remote access to the Company’s systems has increased significantly, which may adversely impact the effectiveness of the Company’s security measures. Consequently, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase, particularly as the Company’s digital businesses expand. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, none of which have been material to the Company to date, individually or in the aggregate. However, there is no assurance that there will not be a cybersecurity threat or incident that has a material adverse effect in the future. While the Company and its vendors have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls that are designed to protect personal data, business information, including intellectual property, and other confidential information, to prevent system disruption, data loss or corruption, and to prevent or detect security breaches, such measures may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring, particularly given that techniques used to access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently. Additionally, it may be difficult to detect and defend against certain threats and vulnerabilities that can persist over extended periods of time. Any network and information systems-related events could require the Company to expend significant resources to remedy such event. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. While the Company maintains cyber risk insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of the Company’s systems and does not extend to reputational damage or costs incurred to improve or strengthen systems against future incidents. Cyber risk insurance has also become more difficult and expensive to obtain, and the Company cannot be certain that its current level of insurance or the breadth of its terms and conditions will continue to be available on economically reasonable terms.\nA significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption of the Company’s systems, or those of third parties upon which its business relies, could result in a disruption of its operations, including degradation or disruption of service, equipment damage, customer, audience or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, lawsuits, remediation costs, a loss of or inability to attract new customers, audience, advertisers or business partners or loss of revenues and other financial losses. If any such failure, compromise, breach, interruption or similar event results in improper access to or disclosure of information maintained in the Company’s information systems and networks or those of its vendors, including financial, personal and credit card data, as well as confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel, customers, vendors and the Company’s business, including its intellectual property, the Company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy, as well as private individual or class action lawsuits. The Company may also be required to notify certain governmental agencies and/or regulators (including the appropriate EU supervisory authority) about any actual or perceived data security breach, as well as the individuals who are affected by any such incident, within strict time periods. In addition, media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in the Company’s systems or those of third parties upon which its business relies, even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact the Company’s brand and reputation and materially affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to Comply with Complex and Evolving U.S. and Foreign Laws and Regulations Regarding Privacy, Data Use and Data Protection Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company’s Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe Company’s business activities are subject to various and increasing laws and regulations in the United States and internationally governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which have implications for how such data is managed. Many of these laws and regulations are increasingly complex and continue to evolve, and substantial uncertainty surrounds their scope and application. Moreover, data privacy and security laws may potentially conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with these laws and regulations could be costly and resource-intensive, require the Company to change its business practices, or limit or restrict aspects of the Company’s business in a manner adverse to its business operations, including by inhibiting or preventing the collection of information that would enable it to provide more targeted, data-driven advertising offerings. The Company’s failure to comply, even if inadvertent or in good faith, or as a result of a compromise, breach or interruption of the Company’s systems by a third party, could result in exposure to enforcement by U.S. federal, state or local or foreign governments or private parties, as well as significant negative publicity and reputational damage. Examples of such laws include the European Union’s GDPR and the UK DPA, each of which expands the regulation of personal data processing throughout the European Union and the U.K., respectively, and significantly increases maximum penalties for non-compliance, California’s CCPA and forthcoming CPRA and Virginia’s CDPA, which establish certain transparency rules, put greater restrictions on the collection, use and sharing of personal information of their respective state residents and provide such\n24\nresidents with certain rights regarding their personal information. See “Governmental Regulation—Data Privacy and Security” for more information.\nRisks Related to Financial Results and Position\nThe Indebtedness of the Company and Certain of its Subsidiaries may Affect their Ability to Operate their Businesses, and may have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company’s Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company and its Subsidiaries may be able to Incur Substantially More Debt, which Could Further Exacerbate the Risks Described Herein.\nAs of June 30, 2021, News Corp had $2.15 billion of total outstanding indebtedness (excluding related party debt) with maturities ranging from fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2029, including $854 million and $314 million, respectively, of indebtedness held by its non-wholly owned subsidiaries, Foxtel and REA Group (collectively with News Corp, the “Debtors”). The indebtedness of the Debtors and the terms of their financing arrangements could: (1) limit their ability to obtain additional financing in the future; (2) make it more difficult for them to satisfy their obligations under the terms of their financing arrangements, including the provisions of any relevant debt instruments, credit agreements, indentures and similar or associated documents (collectively, the “Debt Documents”); (3) limit their ability to refinance their indebtedness on terms acceptable to them or at all; (4) limit their flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which they operate and increase their vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (5) require them to dedicate a substantial portion of their cash flow to make interest and principal payments on their debt, thereby limiting the availability of their cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements; (6) subject them to higher levels of indebtedness than their competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce their flexibility in responding to increased competition; and (7) in the case of the Company’s fixed rate indebtedness, which includes prepayment penalties, diminish the Company’s ability to benefit from any future decrease in interest rates.\nThe ability of the Debtors to satisfy their debt service obligations (including any repurchase obligations) and to fund other cash needs will depend on the Debtors’ future performance and other factors such as changes in interest rates affecting the Debtors’ variable rate indebtedness. Although the Company hedges a portion of this interest rate exposure, there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all, or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties. If the Debtors do not generate enough cash to pay their debt service obligations and fund their other cash requirements, they may be required to restructure or refinance all or part of their existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise additional equity, any or all of which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. The Company and its subsidiaries, including the Debtors, may also be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could exacerbate the effects described elsewhere in this “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nIn addition, the Debtors’ outstanding Debt Documents contain financial and operating covenants that may limit their operational and financial flexibility. These covenants include compliance with, or maintenance of, certain financial tests and ratios and may, depending on the applicable Debtor and subject to certain exceptions, restrict or prohibit such Debtor and/or its subsidiaries from, among other things, incurring or guaranteeing debt, undertaking certain transactions (including certain investments and acquisitions), disposing of certain properties or assets (including subsidiary stock), merging or consolidating with any other person, making financial accommodation available, entering into certain other financing arrangements, creating or permitting certain liens, engaging in transactions with affiliates, making repayments of certain other loans, undergoing fundamental business changes and/or paying dividends or making other restricted payments and investments. Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond the Debtors’ control could affect their ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants. In the event any of these covenants are breached and such breach results in a default under any Debt Documents, the lenders or noteholders, as applicable, may accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under the applicable Debt Documents, which could result in a cross-default under other outstanding Debt Documents and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe Company Could Suffer Losses Due to Asset Impairment and Restructuring Charges.\nAs a result of changes in the Company’s industry and market conditions, the Company has recognized, and may in the future recognize, impairment charges for write-downs of goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other long-lived assets, as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses, which negatively impact the Company’s results of operations and, in the case of cash restructuring charges, its financial condition. Impairments and restructuring charges may also negatively impact the Company’s taxes, including its ability to realize its deferred tax assets and deduct certain interest costs. The Company’s management must regularly evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to the Company’s cash flows in order to determine whether, based on projected discounted future cash flows and other market assumptions, the carrying value for such assets exceeds current fair value and the Company should recognize an\n25\nimpairment. In accordance with GAAP, the Company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The Company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators, such as prevailing conditions in the business environment, credit and capital markets or the economy generally and actual or projected operating results, require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets, as well as other investments and long-lived assets, or require the Company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions. For example, any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in advertising revenue or subscribers, the expected popularity of the content for which the Company has acquired rights and/or consumer acceptance of its products could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units. Any downward revisions in the fair value of a reporting unit, indefinite-lived intangible assets, investments or other long-lived assets could result in additional impairments for which non-cash charges would be required, and any such charge could be material to the Company’s reported results of operations. The Company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends.\nThe Company Could Be Subject to Significant Additional Tax Liabilities, which Could Adversely Affect its Operating Results and Financial Condition.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in U.S. federal, state and local jurisdictions and various non-U.S. jurisdictions, including Australia and the U.K. The Company’s effective tax rate is impacted by the tax laws, regulations, practices and interpretations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on, among other things, the geographic mix of the Company’s profits and losses, changes in tax laws and regulations or their application and interpretation, the outcome of tax audits and changes in valuation allowances associated with the Company’s deferred tax assets. New proposals at the U.S. federal level to increase the U.S. corporate tax rate and minimum taxes on non-U.S. income could, if enacted, have an adverse impact on the Company’s future tax rate and increase its tax provision. The Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances if, among other things, adverse economic conditions negatively impact the Company’s ability to realize its deferred tax assets. Evaluating and estimating the Company’s tax provision, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax accruals requires significant management judgment, and there are often transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\nThe Company’s tax returns are routinely audited by various tax authorities. Tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the Company’s tax returns or positions taken by the Company, and as a result, tax-related settlements or litigation may occur, resulting in additional income tax liabilities against the Company. Although the Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of tax reviews and examinations and any related litigation, the final outcomes of these matters could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the Financial Statements. As a result, the Company may be required to recognize additional charges in its Statements of Operations and pay significant additional amounts with respect to current or prior periods, or its taxes in the future could increase, which could adversely affect its operating results and financial condition.\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) continues to develop a framework of globally coordinated reforms to address the tax challenges arising from globalization and the digitalization of the economy, including expanded taxing rights for countries and the adoption of a global minimum taxation regime. The scope and application of the framework continues to evolve, and its outcome may alter aspects of how the Company’s tax obligations are determined in countries in which it does business. Several jurisdictions have separately enacted new digital services taxes which have had limited impact on the Company’s overall tax obligations, however, the Company continues to monitor proposals as they are introduced. If new taxes on digital services are imposed on the Company, it could have an adverse impact on its business and financial performance.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nAdverse Results from Litigation or Other Proceedings Could Impact the Company’s Business Practices and Operating Results.\nFrom time to time, the Company is party to litigation, as well as to regulatory and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies, including with respect to antitrust, tax, data privacy and security, intellectual property, employment and other matters. See Note 16 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of certain matters. The outcome of these matters and other litigation and proceedings is subject to significant uncertainty, and it is possible that an adverse resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm and/or significant monetary damages, injunctive relief or settlement costs that could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations or financial condition as well as the Company’s ability to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted. In addition, regardless of merit or outcome, such proceedings can have an adverse impact on the Company as a result of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel and other factors.\n26\nThe Company’s Business Could Be Adversely Impacted by Changes in Law, Governmental Policy and Regulation.\nVarious aspects of the Company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world, and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the Company’s products and services are produced or distributed, and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries, could have a negative impact on its interests. For example, the Company’s Australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy, regulation or legislation, or the application or enforcement thereof, applying to companies in the Australian media industry or to Australian companies in general. See “Governmental Regulation—Australian Media Regulation” for more information. In addition, the Company’s newspaper publishing businesses in the U.K. are subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the Leveson inquiry into the U.K. press, and the Company’s radio stations in the U.K. and Ireland are subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities. See “Governmental Regulation—U.K. Press Regulation” and “—U.K. Radio Broadcasting Regulation,” respectively, for more information. Laws and regulations may vary between local, state, federal and international jurisdictions, and the enforcement of those laws and regulations may be inconsistent and unpredictable. The Company may incur substantial costs or be required to change its business practices in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations and could incur substantial penalties or other liabilities in the event of any failure to comply.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nTheft of the Company’s Content, including Digital Piracy and Signal Theft, may Decrease Revenue and Adversely Affect the Company’s Business and Profitability.\nThe Company’s success depends in part on its ability to maintain and monetize the intellectual property rights in its content, and theft of its brands, programming, digital content, books and other copyrighted material affects the value of its content. Developments in technology, including the wide availability of higher internet bandwidth and reduced storage costs, increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to stream, duplicate and widely distribute pirated material, including from other less-regulated countries into the Company’s primary markets. The Company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy by, among other means, preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption, signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software, as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions. However, these efforts may be costly and are not always successful, particularly as infringers continue to develop tools that undermine security features and enable them to disguise their identities online. The proliferation of unauthorized use of the Company’s content undermines lawful distribution channels and reduces the revenue that the Company could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its content. Protection of the Company’s intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the U.S. and abroad, and if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the Company’s rights, or if existing laws are changed or not effectively enforced, the Company’s ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease, or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase. In addition, the failure of legal and technological protections to evolve as piracy and associated technological tools become more sophisticated could make it more difficult for the Company to adequately protect its intellectual property, which could, in turn, negatively impact its value and further increase the Company’s enforcement costs.\nFailure by the Company to Protect Certain Intellectual Property and Brands, or Infringement Claims by Third Parties, Could Adversely Impact the Company’s Business, Results of Operation and Financial Condition.\nThe Company’s businesses rely on a combination of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, as well as licenses, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements, to establish, obtain and protect the intellectual property and brand names used in their businesses. The Company believes its proprietary trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position. However, the Company cannot ensure that these intellectual property rights or those of its licensors (including licenses relating to sports programming rights, set-top box technology and related systems, the NAR License and the Fox Licenses) and suppliers will be enforced or upheld if challenged or that these rights will protect the Company against infringement claims by third parties, and effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country or region in which the Company operates or where its products and services are available. Efforts to protect and enforce the Company’s intellectual property rights may be costly, and any failure by the Company or its licensors and suppliers to effectively protect and enforce its or their intellectual property or brands, or any infringement claims by third parties, could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition. Claims of intellectual property infringement could require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms (if such agreements are available at all), require the Company to spend substantial sums to defend against or settle such claims or to satisfy any judgment rendered against it, or cease any further use of the applicable intellectual property, which could in turn require the\n27\nCompany to change its business practices or offerings and limit its ability to compete effectively. Even if the Company believes any such challenges or claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from its business. In addition, the Company may be contractually required to indemnify other parties against liabilities arising out of any third party infringement claims.\nRisks Related to the Company’s Common Stock\nThe Market Price of the Company’s Stock May Fluctuate Significantly.\nThe Company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade. The market price of the Company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond its control, including: (1) the Company’s quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in its industry; (2) actual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company’s operating results; (3) success or failure of the Company’s business strategy; (4) the Company’s ability to obtain financing as needed; (5) changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; (6) changes in laws and regulations affecting the Company’s business; (7) announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant new business developments or the addition or loss of significant customers; (8) announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; (9) changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the Company’s ability to meet its earnings guidance, if any; (10) the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; (11) investor perception of the Company and the industries in which it operates; (12) results from material litigation or governmental investigations; (13) changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; (14) overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions; and (15) changes in the amounts and frequency of dividends or share repurchases, if any.\nCertain of the Company’s Directors and Officers May Have Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest Because of Their Equity Ownership in Fox Corporation (“FOX”) and/or Because They Also Serve as Officers and/or on the Board of Directors of FOX, Which May Result in the Diversion of Certain Corporate Opportunities to FOX.\nCertain of the Company’s directors and executive officers own shares of FOX’s common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. In addition, certain of the Company’s officers and directors also serve as officers and/or as directors of FOX, including K. Rupert Murdoch, who serves as the Company’s Executive Chairman and Chairman of FOX, and Lachlan K. Murdoch, who serves as the Company’s Co-Chairman and Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of FOX. This ownership or service to both companies may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the Company and FOX. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the Company and FOX regarding the terms of the agreements governing the indemnification of certain matters. In addition to any other arrangements that the Company and FOX may agree to implement, the Company and FOX agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies.\nThe Company’s Amended and Restated By-laws acknowledge that the Company’s directors and officers, as well as certain of its stockholders, including K. Rupert Murdoch, certain members of his family and certain family trusts (so long as such persons continue to own, in the aggregate, 10% or more of the voting stock of each of the Company and FOX), each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder, are or may become stockholders, directors, officers, employees or agents of FOX and certain of its affiliates. The Company’s Amended and Restated By-laws further provide that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the Company, or to any of its stockholders, for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the Company’s Amended and Restated By-laws) to FOX instead of the Company. This could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to FOX instead of the Company.\nCertain Provisions of the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws, the Company’s Fourth Amended and Restated Stockholder Rights Agreement and the Ownership of the Company’s Common Stock by the Murdoch Family Trust May Discourage Takeovers, and the Concentration of Ownership Will Affect the Voting Results of Matters Submitted for Stockholder Approval.\nThe Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws contain certain anti-takeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer, change in control, or takeover attempt that is opposed by the Company’s Board of Directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding voting stock. In particular, the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws provide for, among other things:\n28\n•\na dual class common equity capital structure;\n•\na prohibition on stockholders taking any action by written consent without a meeting;\n•\nspecial stockholders’ meeting to be called only by the Board of Directors, the Chairman or a Vice or Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the holders of not less than 20% of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding voting stock;\n•\nthe requirement that stockholders give the Company advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the Board of Directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders’ meeting;\n•\nthe requirement of an affirmative vote of at least 65% of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal its by-laws;\n•\nvacancies on the Board of Directors to be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n•\ncertain restrictions on the transfer of the Company’s shares; and\n•\nthe Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, Preferred Stock and Series Common Stock with such terms as the Board of Directors may determine.\nThese provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals, if effective, desirable.\nIn addition, in connection with the Separation, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement, which it extended in June 2014, June 2015, June 2018 and again in June 2021. Pursuant to the fourth amended and restated stockholder rights agreement, each outstanding share of the Company’s common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the Company additional shares of its Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the then-outstanding Class B Common Stock without approval of the Company’s Board of Directors, subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15% or more of the Company’s Class B Common Stock immediately following the Separation. The stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the Company’s voting common stock without the approval of its Board of Directors. The rights expire on June 18, 2022, except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement. Further, as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the Murdoch Family Trust, which beneficially owns less than one percent of the Company’s outstanding Class A Common Stock and approximately 38.4% of the Company’s Class B Common Stock as of June 30, 2021, K. Rupert Murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the Murdoch Family Trust. K. Rupert Murdoch, however, disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares. Also, K. Rupert Murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the Company’s Class B Common Stock and less than one percent of the Company’s Class A Common Stock as of June 30, 2021. Thus, K. Rupert Murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and approximately 39.4% of the Company’s Class B Common Stock as of June 30, 2021. This concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the Company. Additionally, the ownership concentration of Class B Common Stock by the Murdoch Family Trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the Murdoch Family Trust will be adopted and proposals that the Murdoch Family Trust does not support will not be adopted, whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of Class B Common Stock. Furthermore, the adoption of the fourth amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent, unless the Company’s Board of Directors otherwise determines at the time, other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the Company’s Class B Common Stock and, accordingly, could prevent a meaningful challenge to the Murdoch Family Trust’s influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval."

The Digital Real Estate Services segment also generates revenue through licenses of certain professional software products on a subscription basis and fees and commissions from referrals generated through its end-to-end digital property search and financing offering and mortgage broking services. Significant expenses associated with these sites, services and software solutions include development costs, advertising and promotional expenses, hosting and support services, salaries, broker commissions, employee benefits and other routine overhead expenses.\nConsumers overwhelmingly turn to the internet and mobile devices for real estate information and services. The Digital Real Estate Services segment’s success depends on its continued innovation to provide products and services that are useful for consumers and real estate, mortgage and financial services professionals and attractive to its advertisers. The Digital Real Estate Services segment operates in a highly competitive digital environment with other operators of real estate and property websites and mobile apps.\nSubscription Video Services\nThe Company’s Subscription Video Services segment consists of (i) its 65% interest in the Foxtel Group and (ii) ANC. The Foxtel Group is the largest Australian-based subscription television provider through its Foxtel pay-TV and Kayo Sports,\nBINGE\nand Foxtel Now streaming services. The Foxtel Group generates revenue primarily through subscription revenue as well as advertising revenue.\nThe Foxtel Group competes for audiences primarily with a variety of other video content providers, such as traditional Free-To-Air (“FTA”) TV operators in Australia, including the three major commercial FTA networks and two major government-funded FTA broadcasters, and content providers that deliver video programming over the internet. These providers include, Internet Protocol television, or IPTV, subscription video-on-demand and broadcast video-on-demand providers; streaming services offered through digital media providers; as well as programmers and distributors that provide content directly to consumers over the internet.\nANC operates the SKY NEWS network, Australia’s 24-hour multi-channel, multi-platform news service, and also owns and operates the Australia Channel IPTV service for international markets. Revenue is primarily derived from monthly affiliate fees received from pay-TV providers based on the number of subscribers and advertising.\nThe most significant operating expenses of the Subscription Video Services segment are the acquisition and production expenses related to programming, the expenses related to operating the technical facilities of the broadcast operations, expenses related to cable, satellite, internet and broadband transmission costs and studio and engineering expense. The expenses associated with licensing certain sports programming rights are recognized during the applicable season or event, which can cause results at the Subscription Video Services segment to fluctuate based on the timing and mix of the Foxtel Group’s local and international sports programming. Sports programming rights costs associated with a dedicated channel are amortized over 12 months. Other expenses include subscriber acquisition costs such as sales costs and marketing and promotional expenses related to improving the market visibility and awareness of the channels and their programming. Additional expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead expenses.\nDow Jones\nThe Dow Jones segment’s products target individual consumers and enterprise customers. Revenue from the Dow Jones segment’s consumer business is derived primarily from circulation, which includes subscription and single-copy sales of its digital and print consumer products, the sale of digital and print advertising, licensing fees for its print and digital consumer content and participation fees for its live journalism events. Circulation revenues are dependent on the content of the Dow Jones segment’s consumer products, prices of its and/or competitors’ products, as well as promotional activities and news cycles. Advertising revenue is dependent on a number of factors, including demand for the Dow Jones segment’s consumer products, general economic and business conditions, demographics of the customer base, advertising rates and effectiveness and brand strength and reputation. Advertising revenues are also subject to seasonality, with revenues typically highest in the Company's second fiscal quarter due to the end-of-year holiday season. In addition, the traditional consumer print business faces challenges from alternative media formats and shifting consumer preferences, which have adversely affected, and are expected to continue to adversely affect, both print circulation and advertising revenues. Advertising, in particular, has been impacted by long-term structural movements in advertising spending from print to digital. The increasing range of advertising choices and formats has\n35\nresulted in audience fragmentation and increased competition. Technologies and policies have also been and will continue to be developed and implemented that may make it more difficult to target and measure the effectiveness of digital advertising or allow users to block advertising on websites and mobile devices, which may impact digital advertising rates or revenues. As a multi-platform news provider, the Dow Jones segment recognizes the importance of maximizing revenues from a variety of media formats and platforms, both in terms of paid-for content and in new advertising models, and continues to invest in its digital and other products, which represent an increasingly larger share of revenues at its consumer business. Mobile devices, their related apps and other technologies, provide continued opportunities for the Dow Jones segment to make its content available to a new audience of readers, introduce new or different pricing schemes and develop its products to continue to attract advertisers and/or affect the relationship between content providers and consumers. The Dow Jones segment continues to develop and implement strategies to exploit its content across a variety of media channels and platforms, including leveraging its content through licensing arrangements with third-party distribution platforms and growing its live journalism events business, which has been affected in recent periods by uncertainty, cancellations and postponements caused by the novel coronavirus (”COVID-19”) pandemic and new revenue models for virtual events.\nOperating expenses for the consumer business include costs related to paper, production, distribution, third party printing, editorial and commissions. Selling, general and administrative expenses include promotional expenses, salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overheads. The costs associated with printing and distributing newspapers, including paper prices and delivery costs, are key operating expenses whose fluctuations can have a material effect on the results of the Dow Jones segment’s consumer business. The consumer business is affected by the cyclical increases and decreases in the price of paper and other factors that may affect paper prices, including tariffs or other restrictions on non-U.S. paper suppliers. In addition, the Dow Jones segment relies on third parties for much of the printing and distribution of its print products. Long-term structural movements from print to digital and the more immediate, as well as longer term, economic impacts of COVID-19 present challenges to the financial and operational stability of these third parties which could, in turn, increase the cost of printing and distributing the Company's newspapers.\nThe Dow Jones segment’s consumer products compete for consumers, audience and advertising with other local and national newspapers, web and app-based media, magazines, investment tools, social media sources and podcasts, as well as other media such as television, radio stations and outdoor displays. As a result of rapidly changing and evolving technologies, distribution platforms and business models, and corresponding changes in consumer behavior, the consumer business continues to face increasing competition for both circulation and advertising revenue, including from a variety of alternative news and information sources. These include both paid and free websites, digital apps, news aggregators, blogs, podcasts, search engines, social media networks, programmatic advertising buying channels, as well as other emerging media and distribution platforms, including off-platform distribution of its products.\nThe Dow Jones segment’s professional information business, which targets enterprise customers, derives revenue primarily from subscriptions to its professional information products. The professional information business serves enterprise customers with products that combine news and information with technology and tools that inform decisions and aid awareness, research and understanding. The success of the professional information business depends on its ability to provide products, services, applications and functionalities that meet the needs of its enterprise customers, who operate in information-intensive and oftentimes highly regulated industries such as finance and insurance. The professional information business must also anticipate and respond to industry trends and regulatory and technological changes.\nSignificant expenses for the professional information business include development costs, sales and marketing expenses, hosting and support services, royalties, salaries, consulting and professional fees, sales commissions, employee benefits and other routine overhead expenses.\nThe Dow Jones segment’s professional information products compete with various information service providers, compliance data providers and global financial newswires, including Reuters News, LexisNexis and Refinitiv, as well as many other providers of news, information and compliance data.\nBook Publishing\nThe Book Publishing segment derives revenues from the sale of general fiction, nonfiction, children’s and religious books in the U.S. and internationally. The revenues and operating results of the Book Publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of its books in the marketplace. The book publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. This marketplace is highly competitive and continues to change due to technological developments, including additional digital platforms, such as e-books and downloadable audiobooks, and distribution channels and other factors. Each book is a separate and distinct product and its financial success depends upon many factors, including public acceptance.\n36\nMajor new title releases represent a significant portion of the Book Publishing segment’s sales throughout the fiscal year. Print-based consumer books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. In the domestic and international markets, the Book Publishing segment is subject to global trends and local economic conditions. Operating expenses for the Book Publishing segment include costs related to paper, printing, authors’ royalties, editorial, promotional, art and design expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead.\nNews Media\nRevenue at the News Media segment is derived primarily from the sale of advertising, circulation and subscriptions, as well as licensing. Adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising, including as a result of COVID-19, continue to affect revenues. Advertising revenues at the News Media segment are also subject to seasonality, with revenues typically being highest in the Company’s second fiscal quarter due to the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. Circulation and subscription revenues can be greatly affected by changes in the prices of the Company’s and/or competitors’ products, as well as by promotional activities and news cycles.\nOperating expenses include costs related to paper, production, distribution, third party printing, editorial, commissions, technology and radio sports rights. Selling, general and administrative expenses include promotional expenses, salaries, employee benefits, rent and other routine overhead.\nThe cost of paper is a key operating expense whose fluctuations can have a material effect on the results of the segment. The News Media segment continues to be exposed to risks associated with paper used for printing. Paper is a basic commodity and its price is sensitive to the balance of supply and demand. The News Media segment’s expenses are affected by the cyclical increases and decreases in the price of paper and other factors that may affect paper prices, including tariffs. The News Media segment’s products compete for readership, audience and advertising with local and national competitors and also compete with other media alternatives in their respective markets. Competition for circulation and subscriptions is based on the content of the products provided, pricing and, from time to time, various promotions. The success of these products also depends upon advertisers’ judgments as to the most effective use of their advertising budgets. Competition for advertising is based upon the reach of the products, advertising rates and advertiser results. Such judgments are based on factors such as cost, availability of alternative media, distribution and quality of consumer demographics.\nThe News Media segment's traditional print business faces challenges from alternative media formats and shifting consumer preferences. The News Media segment is also exposed to the impact of long-term structural movements in advertising spending, in particular, the move from print to digital. These alternative media formats could impact the segment’s overall performance, positively or negatively. In addition, technologies and policies have been and will continue to be developed and implemented that may make it more difficult to target and measure the effectiveness of digital advertising or allow users to block advertising on websites and mobile devices, which may impact digital advertising rates or revenues.\nAs multi-platform news providers, the businesses within the News Media segment recognize the importance of maximizing revenues from a variety of media formats and platforms, both in terms of paid-for content and in new advertising models, and continue to invest in their digital products. Mobile devices, their related apps and other technologies, provide continued opportunities for the businesses within the News Media segment to make their content available to a new audience of readers, introduce new or different pricing schemes and develop their products to continue to attract advertisers and/or affect the relationship between content providers and consumers. The businesses within the News Media segment continue to develop and implement strategies to exploit their content across a variety of media channels and platforms.\nOther\nThe Other segment primarily consists of general corporate overhead expenses, costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters and transformation costs associated with the Company’s ongoing cost reduction initiatives.\nOther Business Developments\nFiscal 2021\nREA Group sale of Malaysia and Thailand businesses\nIn August 2021, REA Group acquired an 18% interest (16.6% on a diluted basis) in PropertyGuru Pte. Ltd. (“PropertyGuru”), a leading digital property technology company operating marketplaces in Southeast Asia, in exchange for all shares of REA\n37\nGroup’s entities in Malaysia and Thailand.

The transaction will create a leading digital real estate services company in Southeast Asia and create new opportunities for collaboration and access to a deeper pool of expertise, technology and investment in the region.

Ltd. (“Elara”) through a subscription for newly-issued preference shares and the buyout of certain minority shareholders. The total aggregate purchase price associated\n38\nwith the acquisition at the completion date is $138 million which primarily consists of $69 million of cash, the fair value of noncontrolling interests of $37 million and the fair value of the Company’s previously held equity interest in Elara of $22 million.

The increases were partially offset by the $596 million decline at the News Media segment, primarily driven by the $649 million impact from the sale of News America Marketing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.\nThe impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue increase of $513 million, or 6%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. The Company calculates the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for businesses reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar by multiplying the results for each quarter in the current period by the difference between the average exchange rate for that quarter and the average exchange rate in effect during the corresponding quarter of the prior year and totaling the impact for all quarters in the current period.\nOperating expenses\n—Operating expenses decreased $169 million, or 3%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. The decrease was largely due to lower operating expenses at the News Media segment of $476 million, primarily due to the sale of News America Marketing, cost savings initiatives and lower newsprint, production and distribution costs, partially offset by the $87 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the absence of the $22 million one-time benefit from the settlement of certain warranty-related claims in the U.K. in fiscal 2020. The decrease at the News Media segment was partially offset by increases of $167 million at the Book Publishing segment driven by increased revenue and $114 million at the Subscription Video Services segment, primarily due to the $139 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in an Operating expense increase of $250 million, or 5%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020.\nSelling, general and administrative\n—Selling, general and administrative increased $259 million, or 9%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020.\nThe increase in Selling, general and administrative for the fiscal year ended\nJune 30,\n40\n2021 was primarily due to increased expenses of $149 million at the Digital Real Estate Services segment, driven by the $40 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and higher employee and marketing costs, as well as a $128 million increase at the Other segment driven primarily by higher employee costs largely related to stock price and Company performance, which were negatively impacted by COVID-19 in the prior year, one-time legal settlement costs and investment spending as the Company ramps up its global cost reduction initiatives. The increase was partially offset by lower expenses of $119 million at the News Media segment driven by the sale of News America Marketing and ongoing cost savings initiatives, partially offset by the $74 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a Selling, general and administrative increase of $177 million, or 6%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020.\nDepreciation and amortization\n—Depreciation and amortization expense increased $36 million, or 6%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020.\nThe impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a depreciation and amortization expense increase of $46 million, or 8%, for the fiscal year\nended June 30, 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020\n.\nImpairment and restructuring charges\n—During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $168 million and $140 million, respectively, of which $122 million and $84 million, respectively, related to the News Media segment. The increase in restructuring charges was primarily as a result of exit costs associated with the anticipated closure of the Company’s Bronx print plant, the termination of a third-party printing contract and the Company’s global cost reduction initiatives.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $1,690 million, primarily due to a $931 million write-down of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at its Foxtel reporting unit in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, $410 million of write-downs related to News America Marketing, including $175 million related to its reclassification to assets held for sale in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, and $292 million in impairments of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets identified during the Company's annual impairment assessment.\nSee Note 5—Restructuring Programs, Note 7—Property, Plant and Equipment and Note 8—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEquity losses of affiliates\n—Equity losses of affiliates increased by $18 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to the $54 million non-cash write-down of the Foxtel Group’s investment in the Nickelodeon Australia Joint Venture. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, Foxtel and ViacomCBS entered into a separate programming rights agreement which will result in the windup of the Nickelodeon Australia Joint Venture in the first half of fiscal 2022. See Note 6—Investments in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest expense, net\n—Interest expense, net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 increased $28 million as compared to fiscal 2020,\nprimarily due to the absence of the impact from the settlement of cash flow hedges related to debt maturities in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nSee Note 9—Borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther, net\n—Other, net increased $134 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. See Note 21—Additional Financial Information in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome tax expense\n—The Company’s income tax expense and effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 were $61 million and 14%, respectively, as compared to an income tax expense and effective tax rate of $21 million and (1)%, respectively, for fiscal 2020.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 the Company recorded income tax expense of $61 million on pre-tax income of $450 million resulting in an effective tax rate that was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The tax rate was impacted by valuation allowances being recorded against tax benefits in certain foreign jurisdictions with operating losses and by the impact of foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates, offset by a release of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets that are more-likely-than-not to be realized and a remeasurement of deferred taxes in the U.K.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, the Company recorded income tax expense of $21 million on a pre-tax loss of $1,524 million resulting in an effective tax rate that was lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate. The tax rate was impacted by the non-cash impairments, which have low or no tax benefit, valuation allowances being recorded against tax benefits in certain foreign jurisdictions with operating losses and by the impact of foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates.\n41\nManagement assesses available evidence to determine whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of existing deferred tax assets. Based on management’s assessment of available evidence, it has been determined that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets in U.S. Federal, State and foreign jurisdictions may not be realized and therefore, a valuation allowance has been established against those tax assets.\nNet income (loss)\n—Net income was $389 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to a net loss of $1,545 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, an improvement of $1,934 million, primarily driven by the absence of non-cash impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2020, higher Total Segment EBITDA and higher Other, net, partially offset by higher tax expense.\nNet (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\n—Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $59 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of $276 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, primarily due to the absence of the non-cash impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2020 at the Company’s Foxtel reporting unit.\nSegment Analysis\nSegment EBITDA is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: depreciation and amortization, impairment and restructuring charges, equity losses of affiliates, interest (expense) income, net, other, net and income tax (expense) benefit. Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of Segment EBITDA.\nSegment EBITDA is the primary measure used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources within, the Company’s businesses. Segment EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze the operating performance of each of the Company’s business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors’ data, although historical results may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences).\nTotal Segment EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income (loss), cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company’s financial performance. The Company believes that the presentation of Total Segment EBITDA provides useful information regarding the Company’s operations and other factors that affect the Company’s reported results. Specifically, the Company believes that by excluding certain one-time or non-cash items such as impairment and restructuring charges and depreciation and amortization, as well as potential distortions between periods caused by factors such as financing and capital structures and changes in tax positions or regimes, the Company provides users of its consolidated financial statements with insight into both its core operations as well as the factors that affect reported results between periods but which the Company believes are not representative of its core business. As a result, users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements are better able to evaluate changes in the core operating results of the Company across different periods.\nThe following table reconciles Net income (loss) to Total Segment EBITDA for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020:\n42\nThe following table sets forth the Company’s Revenues and Segment EBITDA by reportable segment for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020:\nDigital Real Estate Services\n(\n15% and 12% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively)\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, revenues at the Digital Real Estate Services segment increased\n$328 million\n, or 31%, as compared to fiscal 2020. Revenues at Move increased\n$168 million, or\n36%, to\n$641 million\nfor the fiscal year ended\nJune 30, 2021\nfrom\n$473 million\nin fiscal\n2020, primarily driven by higher real estate revenues due to the factors discussed below and the absence of an estimated $15 million of discounts offered to customers in response to COVID-19 during fiscal 2020. The referral model and the traditional lead generation product both benefited from higher lead and transaction volumes. The referral model also benefited from higher average home values and referral fees and generated approximately 29% of total Move revenues. The traditional lead generation product saw continued strong demand from agents, driving improvements in sell-through and yield.\nAt REA Group, revenues increased\n$160 million\n, or 27%, to $752 million for the fiscal year ended\nJune 30, 2021\nfrom\n$592 million\nin fiscal\n2020.\nThe higher revenues were primarily due to the $80 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, an increase in Australian residential depth revenue driven by strong national listings and the $l3 million impact from the acquisition of Elara.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, Segment EBITDA at the Digital Real Estate Services segment increased $169 million, or 49%, as compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in Segment EBITDA was primarily driven by the $100 million and $67 million higher contributions from Move and REA Group, respectively, resulting from the higher revenues discussed above and the $40 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by higher employee costs at both Move and REA Group, an $18 million increase in marketing costs at Move and the $17 million negative impact from the acquisition of Elara. Fiscal 2021 included approximately $12 million of transaction costs related to current year acquisitions.\n43\nSubscription Video Services\n(22% and 21% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively)\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, revenues at the Subscription Video Services segment increased $188 million, or 10%, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and $89 million of higher streaming revenues, primarily from Kayo and\nBINGE\n, partially offset by lower subscription revenues resulting from fewer residential broadcast subscribers. Commercial subscription revenues were largely flat, as the recovery in the commercial sector during the second half of fiscal 2021 largely offset the impact of COVID-19 restrictions that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. However, ongoing lockdowns within certain states in Australia are expected to have a modest negative impact on commercial subscription revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue increase of $217 million, or 12%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, Segment EBITDA increased $36 million, or 11%, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to the $36 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and lower entertainment programming, transmission and employee costs. The increase was partially offset by increased investment in streaming products and $35 million in higher sports programming rights and production costs, primarily driven by the absence of live sports in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions which led to the subsequent recognition of $57 million of those deferred costs in fiscal 2021, partially offset by savings from renegotiated sports rights.\nThe following tables provide information regarding certain key performance indicators for the Foxtel Group, the primary reporting unit within the Subscription Video Services segment, as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Management believes these metrics provide useful information to allow investors to understand trends in consumer behavior and acceptance of the various services offered by the Foxtel Group. Management utilizes these metrics to track and forecast subscription revenue trends across the business’s various linear and streaming products. See “Part I. Business” for further detail regarding these performance indicators including definitions and methods of calculation.\n(a)\nSubscribing households throughout Australia as of June 30, 2021 and 2020.\n(b)\nCommercial subscribers throughout Australia as of June 30, 2021 and 2020.\n(c)\nTotal and Paid Kayo subscribers as of June 30, 2021 and 2020.\n44\n(d)\nTotal and Paid\nBINGE\nsubscribers as of June 30, 2021 and 2020.\nBINGE\nwas launched on May 25, 2020.\n(e)\nTotal and Paid Foxtel Now subscribers as of June 30, 2021 and 2020.\n(f)\nAverage monthly broadcast residential subscription revenue per user (excluding Optus) (Broadcast ARPU) for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.\n(g)\nBroadcast residential subscriber churn rate (excluding Optus) (Broadcast Subscriber Churn) for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.\nDow Jones\n(18% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in both fiscal 2021 and 2020)\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, revenues at the Dow Jones segment increased $112 million, or 7%, as compared to fiscal 2020 driven by an increase in circulation and subscription revenues, higher digital advertising revenues and the $11 million impact from the acquisition of IBD in May 2021, partially offset by declines in print advertising revenues and print circulation revenues. Digital revenues at the Dow Jones segment represented 72% of total revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to 67% in fiscal 2020. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue increase of $13 million as compared to fiscal 2020.\nCirculation and subscription revenues\nCirculation and subscription revenues increased $105 million, or 9%, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. Circulation and other revenues increased $77 million, or 10%, primarily driven by growth in digital-only subscriptions at\nThe Wall Street Journal\nand\nBarron’s\nand a $12 million increase in content licensing revenues, partially offset by print volume declines. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, average daily digital-only subscriptions at\nThe Wall Street Journal\nincreased 21% to 2.7 million as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2020, and digital revenues represented 64% of circulation revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to 58% in fiscal 2020. Revenues at the professional information business increased $28 million, or 6%, as growth of $36 million in Risk & Compliance revenues was partially offset by lower revenues from other professional information business products.\nThe following table summarizes average daily consumer subscriptions during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 for select publications and for all consumer subscription products.\n(a)\n45\n________________________\n(a)\nBased on internal data for the periods from March 29, 2021 to June 27, 2021 and March 30, 2020 to June 28, 2020, respectively, with independent assurance over global total sales and subscriptions provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP UK.\n(b)\nSubscriptions include individual consumer subscriptions, as well as subscriptions purchased by companies, schools, businesses and associations for use by their respective employees, students, customers or members.

For bundles that provide access to both print and digital products every day of the week, only one unit is reported each day and is designated as a print subscription. For bundled products that provide access to the print product only on specified days and full digital access, one print subscription is reported for each day that a print copy is served and one digital subscription is reported for each remaining day of the week.\n(d)\nBarron’s Group consists of\nBarron’s\n, MarketWatch,\nFinancial News\nand\nPrivate Equity News.\n(e)\nTotal Consumer consists of\nThe Wall Street Journal\n, Barron’s Group\nand, from May 5, 2021, Investor’s Business Daily.\nAdvertising revenues\nAdvertising revenues increased $14 million, or 4%, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily driven by the $52 million increase in digital advertising revenue, which represented 58% of advertising revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, as compared to 46% in fiscal 2020. The increase was partially offset by a $38 million decline in print advertising revenues resulting from general market weakness and lower print volume across\nThe Wall Street Journal\nand\nBarron’s\naccelerated by COVID-19.\nSegment EBITDA\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, Segment EBITDA at the Dow Jones segment increased $96 million, or 41%, as compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was mainly due to the increase in revenues discussed above, lower newsprint, production and distribution costs driven by lower print volumes and other discretionary cost savings, partially offset by increased employee and marketing costs.\nBook Publishing\n(21% and 18% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively)\n46\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, revenues at the Book Publishing segment increased $319 million, or 19%, as compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the strong performance across categories, including the\nBridgerton\nseries by Julia Quinn,\nThe Guest List\nby Lucy Foley,\nThe Boy, The Mole, the Fox and the Horse\nby Charlie Mackesy and other backlist titles in the General Books and children’s categories, the strong performance of\nThe Order\nby Daniel Silva,\nThe Happy In A Hurry Cookbook\nby Steve Doocey, and\nDidn’t See That Coming\nby Rachel Hollis, as well as the $32 million impact from the acquisition of a book publisher in Europe in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and the $23 million impact from the acquisition of HMH Books and Media in May 2021. Digital sales increased by 16% as compared to fisca\nl 2020\ndue to growth in both e-books and downloadable audiobooks. Digital sales represented approximately 22% of consumer revenues during the fiscal year ended\nJune 30, 2021. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue increase of $34 million, or 2%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, Segment EBITDA at the Book Publishing segment increased $89 million, or 42%, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to the higher revenues discussed above, partially offset by higher costs related to increased sales volume and higher employee costs.\nNews Media\n(24% and 31% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively)\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, revenues at the News Media segment decreased $596 million, or 21%, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to lower advertising revenues of $677 million driven by the sale of News America Marketing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which contributed $649 million to the decline, the $90 million impact from the closure or transition to digital of regional and community newspapers in Australia as well as continued weakness in the print advertising market exacerbated by COVID-19, partially offset by the $68\nmillion positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and digital advertising growth at the\nNew York Post\nand News UK. Other revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 decreased $23 million as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the $26\nmillion impact from the sale of Unruly in January 2020. Circulation and subscription revenues increased $104 million as compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the $79 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, digital subscriber growth across key mastheads and price increases, partially offset by print volume declines, primarily at News UK. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies resulted in a revenue increase of $169 million, or 6%, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020\n.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, Segment EBITDA at the News Media segment decreased $1 million, or 2%, as compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to the net $50 million negative impact from the sales of News America Marketing and Unruly in fiscal 2020 and the absence of the $22 million one-time benefit from the settlement of certain warranty-related claims in the U.K. in fiscal 2020. The decrease was partially offset by the increased contribution from News Corp Australia of $15 million, primarily due to cost savings initiatives and lower newsprint, production and distribution costs, lower losses at the\nNew York Post\nof $15 million primarily due to higher revenues, the increased contribution from News UK of $9 million and the $8 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations.\nNews Corp Australia\nRevenues were $997 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, a decrease of $8 million, or 1%, as compared to fiscal 2020 revenues of $1,005 million. The closure or transition to digital of regional and community newspapers in Australia resulted in a revenue decrease of $111 million. Advertising revenues decreased\n$79 million,\nprimarily due to the closure or transition to digital of regional and community newspapers and continued weakness in the print advertising market exacerbated by COVID-19, partially offset by the $45 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Circulation and subscription revenues increased\n$66 million\nprimarily driven by the $43 million positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations and digital\n47\nsubscriber growth, which were partially offset by print volume declines resulting from the closure or transition to digital of regional and community newspapers.\nNews UK\nRevenues were $942 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $44 million, or 5%, as compared to fiscal 2020 revenues of $898 million. Circulation and subscription revenues increased\n$44 million\n, primarily driven by the $36 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations, cover price increases, mainly at\nThe Sun\n, and digital subscriber growth, mainly at\nThe Times\nand\nThe Sunday Times\n, partially offset by single-copy volume declines exacerbated by COVID-19, primarily at\nThe Sun\n. Advertising revenues decreased\n$3 million\n, primarily due to continued weakness in the print advertising market exacerbated by COVID-19, partially offset by the $16 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and digital advertising growth.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCurrent Financial Condition\nThe Company’s principal source of liquidity is internally generated funds and cash and cash equivalents on hand. As of June 30, 2021, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were $2.24 billion. The Company also has available borrowing capacity under the 2019 News Corp Credit Facility (as defined below) and certain other facilities, as described below, and expects to have access to the worldwide credit and capital markets, subject to market conditions, in order to issue additional debt if needed or desired. The Company currently expects these elements of liquidity will enable it to meet its liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months, including repayment of indebtedness. Although the Company believes that its cash on hand and future cash from operations, together with its access to the credit and capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund its operating and financing needs for at least the next 12 months, its access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) the financial and operational performance of the Company and/or its operating subsidiaries, as applicable; (ii) the Company’s credit ratings and/or the credit rating of its operating subsidiaries, as applicable; (iii) the provisions of any relevant debt instruments, credit agreements, indentures and similar or associated documents; (iv) the liquidity of the overall credit and capital markets; and (v) the state of the economy. There can be no assurances that the Company will continue to have access to the credit and capital markets on acceptable terms.\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Company’s consolidated assets included $798 million in cash and cash equivalents that were held by its foreign subsidiaries. Of this amount, $128 million is cash not readily accessible by the Company as it is held by REA Group, a majority owned but separately listed public company. REA Group must declare a dividend in order for the Company to have access to its share of REA Group’s cash balance. The Company earns income outside the U.S., which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company does not currently intend to repatriate these earnings. Should the Company require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by and/or available to its domestic operations, the Company could elect to transfer funds held in foreign jurisdictions. The transfer of funds from foreign jurisdictions may be cumbersome due to local regulations, foreign exchange controls and taxes. Additionally, the transfer of funds from foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates and higher cash paid for income taxes for the Company.\nThe principal uses of cash that affect the Company’s liquidity position include the following: operational expenditures including employee costs, paper purchases and programming costs; capital expenditures; income tax payments; investments in associated entities; acquisitions; and the repayment of debt and related interest. In addition to the acquisitions and dispositions disclosed elsewhere, the Company has evaluated, and expects to continue to evaluate, possible future acquisitions and dispositions of certain businesses. Such transactions may be material and may involve cash, the issuance of the Company’s securities or the assumption of indebtedness.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nIn May 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors”) authorized the Company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $500 million of its Class A Common Stock. No stock repurchases were made during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. Over the life of the program through July 30, 2021, the Company cumulatively repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares of Class A Common Stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $71 million. The remaining authorized amount under the stock repurchase program as of July 30, 2021 was approximately $429 million. All decisions regarding any future stock repurchases are at the sole discretion of a duly appointed committee of the Board of Directors and management. The committee’s decisions regarding future stock repurchases will be evaluated from time to time in light of many factors, including the Company’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual restrictions, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the committee may deem relevant. The stock repurchase authorization may be modified, extended, suspended or discontinued at any time by the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors cannot provide any assurances that any additional shares will be repurchased.\n48\nThe Company did not purchase any of its Class A or Class B Common Stock during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.\nDividends\nThe following table summarizes the dividends declared and paid per share on both the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock:\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders, if any, is within the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors’ decisions regarding the payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including the Company’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual restrictions, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant.\nSources and Uses of Cash—Fiscal 2021 versus Fiscal 2020\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (in millions):\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $457 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher Total Segment EBITDA and lower working capital, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid of $88 million and higher restructuring payments of $42 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (in millions):\nNet cash used in investing activities was $1,292 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $427 million for fiscal 2020.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company used $886 million of cash for acquisitions, primarily HMH Books & Media, IBD and Mortgage Choice, and used $390 million of cash for capital expenditures, of which $139 million related to the Foxtel Group. The Company’s capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 are expected to increase approximately $100 million, subject to foreign currency fluctuations, partly driven by higher technology costs and the roll-out of the IP-enabled set-top-boxes at the Foxtel Group.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, the Company used $438 million of cash for capital expenditures, of which $195 million related to Foxtel.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (in millions):\nThe Company had net cash provided by financing activities of $699 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $472 million for fiscal 2020.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company issued $1.0 billion of senior notes and had new borrowings related to REA Group and the Foxtel Group of $515 million, which includes drawdowns under REA Group's 2021 bridge facility to repay outstanding debt in connection with its refinancing completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The net cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by $557 million of repayments for borrowings related to the Foxtel Group and REA Group and dividend payments of $163 million to News Corporation stockholders and REA Group minority stockholders. See Note 9—Borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n49\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, the Company repaid $1,226 million of borrowings related to Foxtel and REA Group, which includes repayments made as part of the debt refinancings completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, and made dividend payments of $158 million to News Corporation stockholders and REA Group minority stockholders. The net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 was partially offset by new borrowings of $926 million, which includes drawdowns under the new facilities entered into as part of the debt refinancings referenced above, and the net settlement of hedges of $57 million.\nReconciliation of Free Cash Flow Available to News Corporation\nFree cash flow available to News Corporation is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures (“free cash flow”), less REA Group free cash flow, plus cash dividends received from REA Group. Free cash flow available to News Corporation should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, cash flows from operations and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow available to News Corporation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of free cash flow.\nThe Company considers free cash flow available to News Corporation to provide useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash that is available to be used to strengthen the Company’s balance sheet and for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the Company’s business, strategic acquisitions, dividend payouts and repurchasing stock. The Company believes excluding REA Group’s free cash flow and including dividends received from REA Group provides users of its consolidated financial statements with a measure of the amount of cash flow that is readily available to the Company, as REA Group is a separately listed public company in Australia and must declare a dividend in order for the Company to have access to its share of REA Group’s cash balance. The Company believes free cash flow available to News Corporation provides a more conservative view of the Company’s free cash flow because this presentation includes only that amount of cash the Company actually receives from REA Group, which has generally been lower than the Company’s unadjusted free cash flow.\nA limitation of free cash flow available to News Corporation is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow available to News Corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the Statements of Cash Flows prepared in accordance with GAAP which incorporate all cash movements during the period.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow available to News Corporation:\nFree cash flow available to News Corporation increased $551 million in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 to $731 million from $180 million in fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher cash provided by operating activities as discussed above and lower capital expenditures.\nBorrowings\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Company, certain subsidiaries of NXE Australia Pty Limited (the “Foxtel Group” and together with such subsidiaries, the “Foxtel Debt Group”) and REA Group and certain of its subsidiaries (REA Group and certain of its subsidiaries, the “REA Debt Group”) had total borrowings of $2.31 billion, including the current portion. Both Foxtel and REA Group are consolidated but non wholly-owned subsidiaries of News Corp, and their indebtedness is only guaranteed by members of the Foxtel Debt Group and REA Debt Group, respectively, and is non-recourse to News Corp.\n50\nNews Corporation Borrowings\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Company had borrowings of $985 million. In April 2021, the Company issued $1 billion of senior notes due 2029 (the “2021 Senior Notes”). The 2021 Senior Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.875% per annum, payable in cash semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing November 15, 2021. The notes will mature on May 15, 2029.\nFoxtel Group Borrowings\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Foxtel Debt Group had (i) borrowings of approximately $914 million, including the full drawdown of its 2019 Term Loan Facility, amounts outstanding under the 2019 Credit Facility and 2017 Working Capital Facility, its outstanding U.S. private placement senior unsecured notes and amounts outstanding under the Telstra Facility (described below), and (ii) total undrawn commitments of A$334 million available under the 2017 Working Capital Facility and 2019 Credit Facility. On April 9, 2021, the Foxtel Debt Group amended its 2019 Credit Facility and 2017 Working Capital Facility to, among other things, extend the debt maturity from November 2022 to May 2024 and reduce the applicable margin to between 2.00% to 3.25%, depending on the Foxtel Debt Group’s net leverage ratio.\nIn addition to third-party indebtedness, the Foxtel Debt Group has related party indebtedness, including A$900 million of outstanding shareholder loans and available facilities from the Company. The shareholder loans bear interest at a variable rate of the Australian BBSY plus an applicable margin ranging from 6.30% to 7.75% and mature in December 2027. The shareholder revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate of the Australian BBSY plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.00% to 3.75%, depending on the Foxtel Debt Group’s net leverage ratio, and matures in July 2024. Additionally, the Foxtel Debt Group has an A$170 million subordinated shareholder loan facility agreement with Telstra which can be used to finance cable transmission costs due to Telstra. The Telstra Facility bears interest at a variable rate of the Australian BBSY plus an applicable margin of 7.75% and matures in December 2027. The Company excludes the utilization of the Telstra Facility from the Statements of Cash Flows because it is non-cash.\nREA Group Borrowings\nAs of June 30, 2021, REA Group had (i) borrowings of approximately $314 million, consisting of amounts outstanding under its new 2021 Bridge Facility, and (ii) A$107 million of undrawn commitments available under the 2021 Bridge Facility. In June 2021, REA Group entered into an A$520 million 2021 Bridge Facility due July 2022 (the “2021 Bridge Facility”). Drawdowns under this facility were used to repay and terminate its A$170 million 2019 Credit Facility, while cash on hand was used to repay the A$70 million 2018 Credit Facility at maturity. The undrawn 2020 Credit Facility and 2020 Overdraft Facility were also terminated. REA Group expects to refinance the 2021 Bridge Facility with a syndicate of loans in the first half of fiscal 2022.\nNews Corp Revolving Credit Facility\nThe Company has an undrawn $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2019 News Corp Credit Facility”) that can be used for general corporate purposes, which terminates on December 12, 2024.\nAll of the Company’s borrowings contain customary representations, covenants and events of default. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants at June 30, 2021.\nSee Note 9—Borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the Company’s outstanding debt, including additional information about interest rates, maturities and covenants related to such debt arrangements.\nCommitments\nThe Company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements (“firm commitments”) to make future payments. These firm commitments secure the current and future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations.\n51\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s material firm commitments as of June 30, 2021:\n________________________\n(a)\nThe Company has commitments under purchase obligations related to minimum subscriber guarantees for license fees, printing contracts, capital projects, marketing agreements, production services and other legally binding commitments.\n(b)\nThe Company has sports programming rights commitments with the National Rugby League, Australian Football League and Cricket Australia, as well as certain other broadcast rights which are payable through fiscal 2028.\n(c)\nThe Company has programming rights commitments with various suppliers for programming content.\n(d)\nThe Company leases office facilities, warehouse facilities, printing plants, satellite services and equipment. These leases, which are classified as operating leases, are expected to be paid at certain dates through fiscal 2048. Amounts reflected represent only the Company’s lease obligations for which it has firm commitments.\n(e)\nThe Company has contractual commitments for satellite transmission services. The Company’s satellite transponder services arrangements extend through fiscal 2032 and are accounted for as operating or finance leases, based on the underlying terms of those arrangements.\n(f)\nSee Note 9—Borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(g)\nReflects the Company’s expected future interest payments on borrowings outstanding and interest rates applicable at June 30, 2021. Such rates are subject to change in future periods. See Note 9—Borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company has certain contracts to purchase newsprint, ink and plates that require the Company to purchase a percentage of its total requirements for production. Since the quantities purchased annually under these contracts are not fixed and are based on the Company’s total requirements, the amount of the related payments for these purchases is excluded from the table above.\nThe table also excludes the Company’s pension obligations, other postretirement benefits (“OPEB”) obligations and the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the Company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing of the commitments. The Company made contributions of $35 million and $30 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. Future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates and statutory requirements. The Company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately $15 million in fiscal 2022, assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the Company’s expected returns in fiscal 2021 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant. The Company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans. Payments due to participants under the Company’s pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts. Payments due under the Company’s OPEB plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations, and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the Company’s OPEB plans. The Company expects its OPEB payments to approximate $8 million in fiscal 2022. See Note 17—Retirement Benefit Obligations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContingencies\nThe Company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections or investigations, including those discussed in Note 16—Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The\n52\noutcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty, and the Company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters. Fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the Company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. Legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred. The Company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable. See Note 16—Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company’s tax returns are subject to on-going review and examination by various tax authorities. Tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the Company’s tax returns, and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable. The Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid. However, these liabilities may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as tax examinations continue to progress, or as settlements or litigations occur.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAn accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. The development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the Company. See Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLong-lived assets\nThe Company’s long-lived assets include goodwill, finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring a business and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment.\nDetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. Identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of long-lived assets acquired, their reporting unit, as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income. The Company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nThe Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced below their carrying value. The Company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments. Indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors, unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts, may signal that an asset has become impaired.\nUnder ASC 350, in assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment. However, if the Company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment, then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the business, and compare the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit primarily by using both a discounted cash flow analysis and market-based valuation approach.\n53\nDetermining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, long-term growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, as part of the Company’s long-range planning process, the Company completed its annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test.\nThe performance of the Company’s annual impairment analysis resulted in no impairments to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2021. Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were discount rates (ranging from 8.0% to 22.0%), long-term growth rates (ranging from 0.0% to 3.0%) and royalty rates (ranging from 0.25% to 6.0%). Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method were EBITDA multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums (ranging from 5.0% to 10.0%). Significant increases (decreases) in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, assuming no change in discount rates, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Significant decreases (increases) in discount rates, assuming no changes in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.\nAs of June 30, 2021, there were no reporting units with goodwill at-risk for future impairment. The Company will continue to monitor its goodwill for possible future impairment.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nThe Company evaluates the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable, in accordance with ASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment” (“ASC 360”). An asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Events or circumstances that might warrant an impairment recoverability review include, among other things, material declines in operating performance, significant adverse market conditions and planned changes in the use of an asset group.\nIn determining whether the carrying value of an asset group is recoverable, the Company estimates undiscounted future cash flows over the estimated life of the primary asset of the asset group. The estimates of such future cash flows require estimating such factors as future operating performance, market conditions and the estimated holding period of each asset. If all or a portion of the carrying value of an asset group is found to be non-recoverable, the Company records an impairment charge equal to the difference between the asset group’s carrying value and its fair value. The Company generally measures fair value by considering sales prices for similar assets or by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate. Typical assumptions applied when using a market-based approach include projected EBITDA and related multiples. Typical assumptions applied when using an income approach include projected free cash flows, discount rates and long-term growth rates. All of these assumptions are made by management based on the best available information at the time of the estimates and are subject to deviations from actual results.\nProgramming Costs\nCosts incurred in acquiring programming rights are accounted for in accordance with ASC 920, “Entertainment—Broadcasters.” Programming rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun, the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing. Programming costs are amortized based on the expected pattern of consumption over the license period or expected useful life of each program. The pattern of consumption is based primarily on consumer viewership information as well as other factors. If initial airings are expected to generate higher viewership, an accelerated method of amortization is used. The Company monitors its programming amortization policy on an ongoing basis and any impact arising from changes to the policy would be recognized prospectively. The Company regularly reviews its programming assets to ensure they continue to reflect fair value. Changes in circumstances may result in a write-down of the asset to fair value. The Company has single and multi-year contracts for broadcast rights of sporting events. The costs of sports contracts are primarily charged to expense over the respective season as events are aired. For sports contracts with dedicated channels, the Company amortizes the sports programming rights costs over 12 months.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under ASC 740, “Income Taxes.”\n54\nThe Company’s annual tax rate is based primarily on its geographic income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant management judgment is required in determining the Company’s provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s net deferred tax assets, if any. In assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets, management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income. The Company’s actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, tax planning and the Company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods. Although the Company believes its current estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management re-evaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available. The Company’s policy is to recognize, when applicable, interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of Income tax (expense) benefit.\nRetirement Benefit Obligations\nThe Company’s employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the Company and its subsidiaries. See Note 17—Retirement Benefit Obligations in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company records amounts relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations specified by GAAP. The measurement and recognition of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of significant management judgments, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, mortality and other actuarial assumptions. Net periodic benefit costs (income) is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations, an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality rates. Current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, were considered in making these assumptions. In developing the expected long-term rate of return, the pension portfolio’s past average rate of returns, and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return of 3.7% for fiscal 2022 is based on a weighted average target asset allocation assumption of 20% equities, 73% fixed-income securities and 7% cash and other investments.\nThe Company recorded $(1) million and $7 million in net periodic benefit (income) costs in the Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company utilizes the full yield-curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nAlthough the discount rate used for each plan will be established and applied individually, a weighted average discount rate of 2.1% will be used in calculating the fiscal 2022 net periodic benefit costs (income). The discount rate reflects the market rate for high-quality fixed-income investments on the Company’s annual measurement date of June 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year. The discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The rate was determined by matching the Company’s expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred high-quality non-callable corporate bonds. The weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the U.S., the U.K., Australia and other foreign countries as of the measurement date.\n55\nThe key assumptions used in developing the Company’s fiscal 2021 and 2020 net periodic benefit costs (income) for its plans consist of the following:\nThe Company will use a weighted average long-term rate of return of 3.7% for fiscal 2022 based principally on a combination of current asset mix and an expectation of future long term investment returns. The accumulated net pre-tax losses on the Company’s pension plans as of June 30, 2021 were approximately $542 million which increased from approximately $529 million for the Company’s pension plans as of June 30, 2020. This increase of $13 million was primarily due to currency movements partially offset by unrecognized losses amortized during fiscal 2021. Lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the Company’s deferred losses and also increase subsequent-year benefit costs. Higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the Company’s accumulated net loss and have a minimal impact on benefit costs. These deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic benefit costs (income) in accordance with ASC 715, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits.” Unrecognized losses for the primary plans in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average life expectancy for plan participants for the primary plans.\nThe Company made contributions of $35 million and $30 million to its funded pension plans in fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns, statutory requirements and interest rate movements. Assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the Company’s expected returns in fiscal 2021 and beyond, and that interest rates remain constant, the Company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately $15 million in fiscal 2022. The Company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans. See Note 18—Other Postretirement Benefits in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\nChanges in net periodic benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the Company’s expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events. The following table highlights the sensitivity of the Company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant:\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements."

    "text": "The Company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency rates, interest rates, stock prices and credit.\n56\nWhen deemed appropriate, the Company uses derivative financial instruments such as cross-currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain risk exposures. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative instruments include:\n•\nforeign currency exchange rate risk: arising primarily through Foxtel Debt Group borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars, payments for customer premise equipment and certain programming rights; and\n•\ninterest rate risk: arising from fixed and floating rate Foxtel Debt Group borrowings. The Company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes.\nThe following sections provide quantitative information on the Company’s exposure to foreign currency rate risk, interest rate risk and other relevant market risks. The Company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company conducts operations in three principal currencies: the U.S. dollar; the Australian dollar; and the British pound sterling. These currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the Company’s U.S., Australian and U.K. operations, respectively. Cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds. To the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements, funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital. The Company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its Australian and U.K. operations.\nBecause of fluctuations in exchange rates, the Company is subject to currency translation risk on the results of its operations. Foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities’ statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the Company’s reporting currency (the U.S. dollar) for consolidation purposes. The Company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally. Exchange rates with the most significant impact to translation include the Australian dollar and British pound sterling. As exchange rates fluctuate, translation of its Statements of Operations into U.S. dollars affects the comparability of revenues and expenses between years.\nThe table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020:\nBased on the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, a one cent change in each of the U.S. dollar/Australian dollar and the U.S. dollar/British pound sterling exchange rates would have impacted revenues by approximately $53 million and $11 million, respectively, for each currency on an annual basis, and would have impacted Total Segment EBITDA by approximately $11 million and $1 million, respectively, on an annual basis.\nDerivatives and Hedging\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Foxtel Group operating subsidiaries, whose functional currency is Australian dollars, had approximately $354 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in U.S. dollars. The remaining borrowings are denominated in Australian dollars. The Foxtel Group utilizes cross-currency interest rate swaps, designated as both cash flow derivatives and fair value hedges, to hedge a portion of the exchange rate risk related to interest and principal payments on its U.S. dollar denominated debt. The total notional value of these cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow derivatives and fair value hedges were approximately $280 million and $70 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2021. Foxtel also has a portfolio of foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of the exchange rate risk related to U.S. dollar payments for customer premise equipment and certain programming rights. The notional value of these foreign exchange contracts was $18 million as of June 30, 2021.\n57\nSome of the derivative instruments in place may create volatility during the fiscal year as they are marked-to-market according to accounting rules which may result in revaluation gains or losses in different periods from when the currency impact on the underlying transactions are realized.\nThe table below provides further details of the sensitivity of the Company’s derivative financial instruments which are subject to foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate risk as of June 30, 2021 (in millions):\nAny resulting changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments may be partially offset by changes in the fair value of certain balance sheet positions (primarily U.S. dollar denominated liabilities) impacted by the change in the foreign exchange rates. The ability to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on earnings depends on the magnitude of the derivatives compared to the balance sheet positions during each reporting cycle.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company’s current financing arrangements and facilities include $1,607 million of outstanding fixed-rate debt and $606 million of outstanding variable-rate bank facilities, before adjustments for unamortized discount and debt issuance costs (See Note 9—Borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements). Fixed and variable-rate debts are impacted differently by changes in interest rates. A change in the market interest rate or yield of fixed-rate debt will only impact the fair market value of such debt, while a change in the market interest rate of variable-rate debt will impact interest expense, as well as the amount of cash required to service such debt. In connection with these borrowings, the Foxtel Group has utilized certain derivative instruments to swap U.S. dollar denominated fixed rate interest payments for Australian dollar denominated variable rate payments. As discussed above, the Foxtel Group utilizes cross-currency interest rate swaps, designated as both cash flow derivatives and fair value hedges, to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk related to interest and principal payments on its U.S. dollar denominated debt. The Company has also utilized certain derivative instruments to swap Australian dollar denominated variable interest rate payments for Australian dollar denominated fixed rate payments. As of June 30, 2021, the notional amount of interest rate swap contracts outstanding was approximately A$300 million. Refer to the table above for further details of the sensitivity of the Company’s financial instruments which are subject to interest rate risk.\nStock Prices\nThe Company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market price volatility. These investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately $164 million as of June 30, 2021. A hypothetical decrease in the market price of these investments of 10% would result in a decrease in income of approximately $16 million before tax.\nCredit Risk\nCash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.\nThe Company’s receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of June 30, 2021 or June 30, 2020 due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Company’s products and services are sold.\nThe Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. As of June 30, 2021, the Company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties.\n58"

News Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n•\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of News Corporation;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of News Corporation are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of News Corporation; and\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting includes the controls themselves, monitoring and internal auditing practices and actions taken to correct deficiencies as identified.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, may not prevent or detect misstatements. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was made as of a specific date. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of News Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in the 2013 “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Management’s assessment included an evaluation of the design of News Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines permitting the exclusion of a recently acquired business from management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting in the year of acquisition, management did not assess the internal controls of Mortgage Choice, HMH Books & Media and IBD (acquisition dates and related details can be found within the Overview of the Company’s Businesses in Item 7). The total assets and total revenues of the acquired businesses constituted approximately 7% of total assets as of June 30, 2021, the majority of which are goodwill and intangible assets, and less than 1% of total revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with the Audit Committee of News Corporation’s Board of Directors.\nBased on this assessment, management did not identify any material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and management determined that, as of June 30, 2021, News Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.\nErnst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who audited and reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements of News Corporation included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, has audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Their report appears on the following page.\nAugust 10, 2021\n60\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of News Corporation:\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited News Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, News Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Mortgage Choice, HMH Books & Media and IBD, which are included in the 2021 consolidated financial statements of News Corporation and constitute approximately 7% of total assets as of June 30, 2021 and less than 1% of total revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of News Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Mortgage Choice, HMH Books and Media and IBD.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of News Corporation as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”) and our report dated August 10, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nNew York, New York\nAugust 10, 2021\n61\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of News Corporation:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of News Corporation (the Company) as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of News Corporation at June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), News Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated August 10, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of News Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n62\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2012.\nNew York, New York\nAugust 10, 2021\n63\nNEWS CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited consolidated financial statements.\n64\nNEWS CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\n(IN MILLIONS)\n________________________\n(a)\nNet of income tax (benefit) expense of\nnil\n, $(\n3\n) million and $\n1\nmillion for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(b)\nNet of income tax benefit of $\n1\nmillion, $\n11\nmillion and $\n10\nmillion for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(c)\nPrimarily consists of foreign currency translation adjustments.\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited consolidated financial statements.\n65\nNEWS CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS)\n________________________\n(a)\nClass A common stock\n, $\n0.01\npar value per share (“Class A Common Stock”),\n1,500,000,000\nshares authorized,\n391,212,047\nand\n388,922,752\nshares issued and outstanding, net of\n27,368,413\ntreasury shares at par at June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively.\n(b)\nClass B common stock\n, $\n0.01\npar value per share (“Class B Common Stock”),\n750,000,000\nshares authorized,\n199,630,240\nshares issued and outstanding, net of\n78,430,424\ntreasury shares at par at June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively.\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited consolidated financial statements.\n66\nNEWS CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(IN MILLIONS)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited consolidated financial statements.\n67\nNEWS CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EQUITY\n(IN MILLIONS)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited consolidated financial statements.\n68\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nNews Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “News Corporation,” “News Corp,” the “Company,” “we” or “us”) is a global diversified media and information services company comprised of businesses across a range of media, including: digital real estate services, subscription video services in Australia, news and information services and book publishing.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2020, in connection with the Company's sale of its News America Marketing reporting unit and its annual review of its reportable segments, the Company determined to disaggregate its Dow Jones operating segment as a separate reportable segment in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 280, “Segment Reporting.” Previously, the financial information for this operating segment was aggregated with the businesses within the News Media operating segment and, together, formed the News and Information Services reportable segment. Following the sale of its News America Marketing business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and in conjunction with the Company’s annual budgeting process, the Company determined that aggregation was no longer appropriate as certain of the remaining businesses no longer shared similar economic characteristics. As a result, the Company has revised its historical disclosures to reflect the new Dow Jones and News Media reportable segments for all years presented.\nBasis of presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company, which are referred to herein as the “Consolidated Financial Statements,” have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Company’s financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are presented on a consolidated basis.\nThe consolidated statements of operations are referred to herein as the “Statements of Operations.” The consolidated balance sheets are referred to herein as the “Balance Sheets.” The consolidated statements of cash flows are referred to herein as the “Statements of Cash Flows.”\nThe Company maintains a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to June 30 in each year. Fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 each included 52 weeks. All references to the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 relate to the fiscal years ended June 27, 2021, June 28, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively. For convenience purposes, the Company continues to date its consolidated financial statements as of June 30.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of all majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. In addition, the Company evaluates its relationships with other entities to identify whether they are variable interest entities (“VIEs”) as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 810-10, “Consolidation” (“ASC 810-10”) and whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. Consolidation is required if both of these criteria are met. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation, including the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.\nChanges in the Company’s ownership interest in a consolidated subsidiary where a controlling financial interest is retained are accounted for as capital transactions. When the Company ceases to have a controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary the Company will recognize a gain or loss in the Statements of Operations upon deconsolidation.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and other investments that are readily convertible into cash with original maturities of three months or less. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 also includes\n69\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n$\n128\nmillion and $\n153\nmillion, respectively, which is not readily accessible by the Company as it is held by REA Group Limited (“REA Group”), a majority owned but separately listed public company. REA Group must declare a dividend in order for the Company to have access to its share of REA Group’s cash balance. The Company classifies cash as restricted when the cash is unavailable for use in its general operations. The Company had\nno\nrestricted cash as of June 30, 2021 and 2020.\nConcentration of credit risk\nCash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions. The Company has deposits held with banks that exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.\nReceivables, net\nReceivables are presented net of allowances, which reflect the Company’s expected credit losses based on historical experience as well as current and expected economic conditions. Allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated by pooling receivables with similar credit risks such as the level of delinquency, types of products or services and geographical locations and reflects the Company’s expected credit losses based on historical experience as well as current and expected economic conditions.\nReceivables, net consist of:\nThe Company’s receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of June 30, 2021 or June 30, 2020 due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Company’s products and services are sold.\nInventory, net\nInventory primarily consists of programming rights, books, newsprint and printing ink. In accordance with ASC 920, “Entertainment—Broadcasters,” programming rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun, the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing. Programming costs are amortized based on the expected pattern of consumption over the license period or expected useful life of each program. The pattern of consumption is based primarily on consumer viewership information as well as other factors. The Company regularly reviews its programming assets to ensure they continue to reflect fair value. Changes in circumstances may result in a write-down of the asset to fair value.\nThe Company’s programming rights are substantially all monetized as a film group. The amortization expense of programming costs, which is reflected within Operating expenses in the Statements of Operations, was $\n262\nmillion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. Approximately $\n139\nmillion, $\n54\nmillion and $\n22\nmillion of the unamortized programming costs as of June 30, 2021 are expected to be amortized in each of the fiscal years ending June 30, 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively.\nInventory for books and newsprint are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost for non-programming inventory is determined by the weighted average cost method. The Company records a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based upon a calculation using the historical usage rates, sales patterns of its products and specifically identified obsolete inventory.\nInvestments\nThe Company makes investments in various businesses in the normal course of business. The Company evaluates its relationships with other entities to identify whether they are VIEs in accordance with ASC 810-10 and whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. In determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, it assesses whether it has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive\n70\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nbenefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company would consolidate any investments in which it was determined to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE.\nInvestments in and advances to equity investments or joint ventures in which the Company has significant influence, but is not the primary beneficiary, and has less than a controlling voting interest, are accounted for using the equity method. Significant influence is generally presumed to exist when the Company owns an interest between\n20\n% and\n50\n% or when the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company includes its investments and amounts due to and from such investments in its Balance Sheets. The Company’s Statements of Operations include the Company’s share of the investees’ earnings (losses) and the Company’s Statements of Cash Flows include all cash received from or paid to the investee.\nThe difference between the Company’s investment and its share of the fair value of the underlying net tangible assets of the investee upon acquisition is first allocated to either finite-lived intangibles, indefinite-lived intangibles or other assets and liabilities and the balance is attributed to goodwill. The Company follows ASC 350, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other” (“ASC 350”), which requires that equity method finite-lived intangibles be amortized over their estimated useful life. Such amortization is reflected in Equity (losses) earnings of affiliates in the Statements of Operations. Indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill are not amortized.\nInvestments in which the Company has no significant influence (generally less than a 20% ownership interest) or does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for in accordance with ASC 825-10, “Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“ASC 825-10”). Gains and losses on equity securities with readily determinable fair market values are recorded in Other, net in the Statement of Operations. Equity securities without readily determinable fair market values are valued at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes in fair value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. See Note 6—Investments.\nFinancial instruments and derivatives\nThe carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, approximate fair value. The fair value of financial instruments is generally determined by reference to market values resulting from trading on a national securities exchange, trading in an over-the-counter market which are considered to be Level 2 measurements or unobservable inputs that require the Company to use its own best estimates about market participant assumptions which are considered to be Level 3 measurements. See Note 11—Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements.\nASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”) requires derivative instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as either an asset or a liability. ASC 815 also requires that changes in the fair value of recorded derivatives be recognized currently in the Statements of Operations unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.\nFor derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions continue to be highly effective.\nThe Company determines the fair values of its derivatives using standard valuation models. The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of the Company’s exposure to the financial risks. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company does not view the fair values of its derivatives in isolation, but rather in relation to the fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged transactions or other exposures. All of the Company’s derivatives are over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of master netting agreements which allow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions with the same counterparty. As the Company does not intend to settle any derivatives at their net positions, derivative instruments are presented gross in the Balance Sheets. See Note 11—Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements.\nThe Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. As of June 30, 2021, the Company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties.\n71\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCash flow hedges\nCash flow hedges are used to mitigate the Company’s exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to particular risk associated with a highly probable forecasted transaction or a recognized asset or liability which could affect income or expenses. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized directly in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are recognized in the Statements of Operations when the hedged forecasted transaction impacts income or if the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur.\nUpon adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-12 in fiscal 2020, the Company reclassified $\n5\nmillion in gains from Accumulated deficit to Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to amounts previously recorded for the ineffective portion of outstanding derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company excluded the cross-currency basis spread from the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.\nFair value hedges\nFair value hedges are used to mitigate the Company’s exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability, or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect income or expenses. The hedged item is adjusted for gains and losses attributable to the risk being hedged and the derivative is remeasured to fair value. The Company records the changes in the fair value of these items in the Statements of Operations.\nEconomic hedges\nDerivatives not designated as accounting hedge relationships or for which hedge accounting has been discontinued are referred to as economic hedges. Economic hedges are those derivatives which the Company uses to mitigate its exposure to variability in the cash flows of a forecasted transaction or the fair value of a recognized asset or liability, but which do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with ASC 815. When a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. The economic hedges are adjusted to fair value each period in Other, net in the Statements of Operations.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of\n2\nto\n50\nyears. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their useful lives or the life of the lease. Costs associated with the repair and maintenance of property, plant and equipment are expensed as incurred. Changes in circumstances, such as technological advances or changes to the Company’s business model or capital strategy, could result in the actual useful lives differing from the Company’s estimates. In those cases where the Company determines that the useful life of buildings and equipment should be changed, the Company would depreciate the asset over its revised remaining useful life, thereby increasing or decreasing depreciation expense.\nLeases\nLeases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if any one of the following criteria are met: the lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset or the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any one of these criteria.\nThe Company’s operating leases primarily consist of real estate, including office space, warehouse space and printing facilities, and satellite transponders for purposes of providing its subscription video services to consumers and its finance leases consist of satellite transponders.\nFor operating leases, minimum lease payments, including minimum scheduled rent increases, are recognized as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease terms. For finance leases, lease expense consists of the depreciation of the right-of-use asset, as well as interest expense recognized on the lease liability based on the effective interest method using the rate implicit in the lease or the Company's incremental borrowing rate. A lease's term begins on the date that the Company obtains possession of the leased premises and goes through the expected lease termination date. See Note 10—Leases.\n72\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCapitalized software\nIn accordance with ASC 350-40, “Internal-use Software,” the Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal-use software. Costs incurred in the preliminary project stage are expensed. All direct costs incurred to develop internal-use software during the development stage are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life, generally\n2\nto\n13\nyears. Costs such as maintenance and training are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs are also expensed as incurred.\nIn accordance with ASC 350-24, “Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract”, the Company evaluates upfront costs, including implementation, set-up or other costs (collectively, “implementation costs”), for hosting arrangements under the internal-use software framework. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred, whereas costs incurred in the development stage are generally capitalized as prepaid assets within Other Current Assets in the Balance Sheet. Capitalized implementation costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected term of the hosting arrangement, which includes consideration of the non-cancellable contractual term and reasonably certain renewals. Amortization of capitalized implementation costs is included in the same line item in the Statements of Operations as the expense for fees for the associated hosting arrangement.\nRoyalty advances to authors\nRoyalty advances are initially capitalized and subsequently expensed as related revenues are earned or when the Company determines future recovery is not probable. The Company has a long history of providing authors with royalty advances, and it tracks each advance earned with respect to the sale of the related publication. Historically, the longer the unearned portion of the advance remains outstanding, the less likely it is that the Company will recover the advance through the sale of the publication. The Company applies this historical experience to its existing outstanding royalty advances to estimate the likelihood of recovery and a provision is established to write-off the unearned advance, usually between\n12\nand\n24\nmonths after initial publication of the first format. Additionally, the Company reviews its portfolio of royalty advances for unpublished titles to determine if individual royalty advances are not recoverable for discrete reasons, such as the death of an author prior to completion of a title or titles, a Company decision to not publish a title, poor market demand or other relevant factors that could impact recoverability. Based on this information, the portion of any advance that the Company believes is not recoverable is expensed.\nGoodwill and intangible assets\nThe Company has goodwill and intangible assets, including trademarks and tradenames, newspaper mastheads, publishing imprints, radio broadcast licenses, publishing rights and customer relationships. Goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring entities or businesses and amounts assigned to their tangible and identifiable intangible net assets. In accordance with ASC 350, the Company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or earlier if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair values below their carrying amounts. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment at a reporting unit level. Reporting units are determined based on an evaluation of the Company’s operating segments and the components making up those operating segments. For purposes of its goodwill impairment review, the Company has identified Dow Jones, the Australian newspapers, the U.K. newspapers, the\nNew York Post\n, Storyful Limited (“Storyful”), Wireless Group plc (“Wireless Group”), the Foxtel Group, Australian News Channel (“ANC”), HarperCollins, REA Group and Move, Inc. (“Move”), as its reporting units.\nIn accordance with ASC 350, in assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment. However, if the Company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment, then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the business, and compare the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If through a quantitative analysis the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired. If the Company concludes that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.\n73\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company also performs impairment reviews on its indefinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks and tradenames, newspaper mastheads, publishing imprints and radio broadcast licenses. Newspaper mastheads and book publishing imprints are reviewed on an aggregated basis in accordance with ASC 350. Trademarks and tradenames and radio broadcast licenses are reviewed individually. In assessing its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, the Company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing the asset for impairment. However, if the Company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment, then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine if the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If through a quantitative analysis the Company determines the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying amount, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered not to be impaired. If the Company concludes that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the indefinite-lived intangible asset’s fair value.\nThe methods used to estimate the fair value measurements of the Company’s reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets include those based on the income approach (including the discounted cash flow, relief-from-royalty and excess earnings methods) and those based on the market approach (primarily the guideline public company method). The resulting fair value measurements of the assets are considered to be Level 3 measurements. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, long-term growth rates, relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The cash flows employed in the analyses are based on the Company’s estimated outlook and various growth rates are assumed for years beyond the long-term business plan period. Discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units. In assessing the reasonableness of its determined fair values, the Company evaluates its results against other value indicators, such as comparable public company trading values.\nWhen a business within a reporting unit is disposed of, goodwill is allocated to the disposed business using the relative fair value method.\nBorrowings\nLoans and borrowings are initially recognized at the fair value of the consideration received. Transaction costs are recorded within current borrowings (current portion) and non-current borrowings (long-term portion) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. They are subsequently recognized at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Debt may be considered extinguished when it has been modified and the terms of the new debt instruments and old debt instruments are substantially different, as that term is defined in the debt modification guidance in ASC 470-50 “Debt—Modifications and Extinguishments.” The Company classifies the current portion of long term debt as non-current liabilities on the Balance Sheets when it has the intent and ability to refinance the obligation on a long-term basis, in accordance with ASC 470 “Debt.”\nRetirement benefit obligations\nThe Company provides defined benefit pension, postretirement healthcare and defined contribution benefits to the Company’s eligible employees and retirees. The Company accounts for its defined benefit pension, postretirement healthcare and defined contribution plans in accordance with ASC 715, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits” (“ASC 715”). The expense recognized by the Company is determined using certain assumptions, including the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return of pension assets and mortality rates, among others. The Company recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit plans (other than multiemployer plans) as an asset or liability in the Balance Sheets and recognizes changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Balance Sheets. The Company recognizes the other non-service cost components of net periodic benefit (income) cost in Other, net in the Statements of Operations.\nFair value measurements\nThe Company has various financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including certain marketable securities and derivatives. The Company also applies the provisions of fair value measurement to various non-recurring measurements for the Company’s non-financial assets and liabilities. With the exception of investments measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient in accordance with ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements” (“ASC 820”)” or ASC 825-10\n74\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ndescribed above, the Company measures assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 820, using inputs from the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy: (i) inputs that are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (“Level 1”); (ii) inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities (“Level 2”); and (iii) unobservable inputs that require the entity to use its own best estimates about market participant assumptions (“Level 3”). See Note 11—Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements.\nThe Company’s assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include investments, long-lived assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill. The Company reviews the carrying amounts of such assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable or at least annually during the fourth quarter for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill. Any resulting asset impairment would require that the asset be recorded at its fair value. The resulting fair value measurements of the assets are considered to be Level 3 measurements.\nAsset impairments\nInvestments\nEquity method investments are regularly reviewed to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may impact the fair value of each investment. If the fair value of the investment has dropped below the carrying amount, management considers several factors when determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in market value has occurred, including the length of time and extent to which the market value has been below cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value and other factors influencing the fair market value, such as general market conditions.\nLong-lived assets\nASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment” (“ASC 360”) and ASC 350 require the Company to periodically review the carrying amounts of its long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, to determine whether current events or circumstances indicate that such carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of the asset is greater than the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by such asset, an impairment adjustment is recognized if the carrying value of such asset exceeds its fair value. The Company generally measures fair value by considering sale prices for similar assets or by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate. Considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of assets; accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates. Assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of their financial statement carrying amount or fair value, less their costs to sell.\nTreasury Stock\nThe Company accounts for treasury stock using the cost method. Upon the retirement of treasury stock, the Company allocates the value of treasury shares between common stock, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. All shares repurchased to date have been retired. See Note 12—Stockholders' Equity.\nRevenue recognition\nCirculation and subscription revenues\nCirculation and subscription revenues include subscription and single-copy sales of digital and print news products, information services subscription revenues and pay television broadcast and streaming subscription revenues. Circulation revenues are based on the number of copies of the printed news products (through home-delivery subscriptions and single-copy sales) and/or digital subscriptions sold, and the associated rates charged to the customers. Single-copy revenue is recognized at a point in time on the date the news products are sold to distribution outlets, net of provisions for related returns.\nRevenues from home delivery and digital subscriptions are recognized over the subscription term as the news products and/or digital subscriptions are delivered. Information services subscription revenues are recognized over time as the subscriptions are delivered. Payments from subscribers are generally due at the beginning of the month and are recorded as deferred revenue. Such amounts are recognized as revenue as the associated subscription is delivered.\n75\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRevenue generated from subscriptions to receive pay television broadcast, streaming, broadband and phone services for residential and commercial subscribers is recognized over time on a monthly basis as the services are provided. Payment is generally received monthly in advance of providing services, and is deferred upon receipt. Such amounts are recognized as revenue as the related services are provided.\nAdvertising revenues\nRevenue from print advertising is recognized at the point in time the print advertisement is published. Broadcast advertising revenue is recognized over the time that the broadcast advertisement is aired. For impressions-based digital advertising, revenues are recognized as impressions are delivered over the term of the arrangement, while revenue from non-impressions-based digital advertising is recognized over the period that the advertisements are displayed. Such amounts are recognized net of agency commissions and provisions for estimated sales incentives, including rebates, rate adjustments or discounts.\nAdvertising revenues earned from integrated marketing services are recognized at the point in time when free-standing inserts are published. Revenues earned from in-store marketing services are partially recognized upon installation, with the remaining revenue recognized over the in-store campaign.\nThe Company enters into transactions that involve the exchange of advertising, in part, for other products and services, which are recorded at the estimated fair value of the product or service received. If the fair value of the product or service received cannot be reliably determined, the value is measured indirectly by reference to the standalone selling price of the advertising provided by the Company. Revenue from nonmonetary transactions is recognized when services are performed, and expenses are recognized when products are received or services are incurred.\nBillings to clients and payments received in advance of performance of services or delivery of products are recorded as deferred revenue until the services are performed or the product is delivered. Payment for advertising services is typically due shortly after the Company has satisfied its performance obligation to print, broadcast or place the advertising specified in the contract. For advertising campaigns that extend beyond one month, the Company generally invoices the advertiser in arrears based on the number of advertisements that were printed, broadcast or placed, or impressions delivered during the month.\nConsumer revenues\nRevenue from the sale of physical books and electronic books (“e-books”) is recognized at the point in time of physical receipt by the customer or electronic delivery. Such amounts are recorded net of provisions for returns and payments to customers. If the Company prohibits its customer from selling a physical book until a future date, it recognizes revenue when that restriction lapses.\nRevenue is recognized net of any amounts billed to customers for taxes remitted to government authorities. Payments for the sale of physical books and e-books are generally collected within one to three months of sale or delivery and are based on the number of physical books or e-books sold.\nReal Estate revenues\nReal estate revenues are derived from the sale of digital real estate listing and lead generation products and advanced client management and reporting products, as well as services to agents, brokers and developers. Revenue is typically recognized over the contractual period during which the services are provided. Payments are generally due monthly over the subscription term.\nThe Company also provides certain leads to agents and brokers at no upfront cost with the Company receiving a portion of the agent sales commission at the time a home transaction is closed. As the amount of revenues is based on several factors outside of the Company’s control including home prices, revenue is recognized when a real estate transaction is closed and any variability no longer exists.\nOther revenues\nOther revenues are recognized when the related services are performed or the product has been delivered.\n76\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nContracts with multiple performance obligations\nThe Company has certain revenue contracts which contain multiple performance obligations such as print and digital advertising bundles, digital and print newspaper subscription bundles and bundled video service subscriptions. Revenues derived from sales contracts that contain multiple products and services are allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation to be delivered. Standalone selling price is typically determined based on prices charged to customers for the same or similar goods or services on a standalone basis. If observable standalone prices are not available, the Company estimates standalone selling price by maximizing the use of observable inputs to most accurately reflect the price of each individual performance obligation. Revenue is recognized as each performance obligation included in the contract is satisfied.\nIdentification of a customer and gross versus net revenue recognition\nIn the normal course of business, the Company acts as or uses an intermediary or agent in executing transactions with third parties. When the intermediary or agent is determined to be the Company’s customer, the Company records revenue based on the amount it expects to receive from the agent or intermediary.\nIn other circumstances, the determination of whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on an assessment of whether the Company is acting as the principal or an agent in the transaction. If the Company is acting as a principal in a transaction, the Company reports revenue on a gross basis. If the Company is acting as an agent in a transaction, the Company reports revenue on a net basis. The determination of whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent in a transaction involves judgment and is based on an evaluation of the terms of the arrangement. The Company serves as the principal in transactions in which it controls the goods or services prior to being transferred to the ultimate customer.\nSales returns\nCertain of the Company’s products, such as books and newspapers, are sold with the right of return. The Company records the estimated impact of such returns as a reduction of revenue. To estimate product sales that will be returned and the related products that are expected to be placed back into inventory, the Company analyzes historical returns, current economic trends, changes in customer demand and acceptance of the Company’s products. Based on this information, the Company reserves a percentage of each dollar of product sales that provide the customer with the right of return.\nSubscriber acquisition costs\nCosts related to the acquisition of subscription video service customers primarily consist of amounts paid for third-party customer acquisitions, which consist of the cost of commissions paid to authorized retailers and dealers for subscribers added through their respective distribution channels and the cost of hardware and installation subsidies for subscribers. All costs, including hardware, installation and commissions, are expensed upon activation, except where legal ownership of the equipment is retained, in which case the cost of the equipment and direct and indirect installation costs are capitalized and depreciated over the respective useful life.\nAdvertising expenses\nThe Company expenses advertising costs as incurred in accordance with ASC 720-35, “Other Expenses—Advertising Cost.”\nAdvertising and promotional expenses recognized totaled $\n550\nmillion, $\n525\nmillion and $\n669\nmillion for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nShipping and handling\nCosts incurred for shipping and handling are reflected in Operating expenses in the Statements of Operations.\nTranslation of foreign currencies\nThe financial results and position of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated into U.S. dollars using the current rate method, whereby operating results are converted at the average rate of exchange for the period and assets and liabilities are converted at the closing rates on the period end date. The resulting translation adjustments are accumulated as a component of\n77\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are generally included in income for the period.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”). ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Valuation allowances are established where management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company recognizes interest and penalty charges related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.\nThe Company has not provided for taxes on undistributed earnings attributable to certain foreign subsidiaries. It is the Company’s intention to reinvest in these subsidiaries indefinitely as the Company does not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to satisfy domestic liquidity needs. An actual repatriation from these subsidiaries could be subject to foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state taxes. Calculation of the unrecognized tax liabilities is not practicable.\nEarnings (loss) per share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share for Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock is calculated by dividing Net income (loss) attributable to News Corporation stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share for Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock is calculated similarly, except that the calculation includes the dilutive effect of the assumed issuance of shares issuable under the Company’s equity-based compensation plans. See Note 14—Earnings (Loss) Per Share.\nEquity-based compensation\nEquity-based awards are accounted for in accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation” (“ASC 718”). ASC 718 requires that the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. ASC 718 establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all companies to apply a fair-value-based measurement method in accounting for generally all share-based payment transactions with employees.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nAdopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASU 2016-13”). The amendments in ASU 2016-13 require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.

ASU 2019-12 is effective for the Company for annual and interim reporting periods beginning July 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material effect on its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNOTE 3. REVENUES\nOn July 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”) on a modified retrospective basis for all contracts which were not completed as of the adoption date. Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized when or as the Company satisfies its respective performance obligations under each contract. The Company recorded a $\n20\nmillion decrease to Accumulated deficit as of July 1, 2018 to reflect the cumulative impact of its adoption of ASC 606.\nDisaggregated revenue\nThe following tables present the Company’s disaggregated revenues by type and segment for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n79\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nContract liabilities and assets\nThe Company’s deferred revenue balance primarily relates to amounts received from customers for subscriptions paid in advance of the services being provided.\nThe following table presents changes in the deferred revenue balance for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020:\n________________________\n(a)\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized approximately $\n381\nmillion and $\n384\nmillion, respectively, of revenue which was included in the opening deferred revenue balance.\n(b)\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, includes $\n16\nmillion of deferred revenue acquired as a result of the acquisition of IBD.

See Note 4—Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions.\nContract assets were immaterial for disclosure as of June 30, 2021 and 2020.\nOther revenue disclosures\nThe Company typically expenses sales commissions incurred to obtain a customer contract as those amounts are incurred as the amortization period is 12 months or less. These costs are recorded within Selling, general and administrative in the Statements of Operations. The Company also does not capitalize significant financing components when the transfer of the good or service is paid within 12 months or less, or the receipt of consideration is received within 12 months or less of the transfer of the good or service.\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company recognized approximately $\n392\nmillion in revenues related to performance obligations that were satisfied or partially satisfied in a prior reporting period. The remaining transaction price related to unsatisfied performance obligations as of June 30, 2021 was approximately $\n820\nmillion, of which approximately $\n302\nmillion is expected to be recognized during fiscal 2022, $\n244\nmillion is expected to be recognized in fiscal 2023 and $\n169\nmillion is expected to be recognized in fiscal 2024, with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. These amounts do not include (i) contracts with an expected duration of one year or less, (ii) contracts for which variable consideration is determined based on the customer’s subsequent sale or usage and (iii) variable consideration allocated to performance obligations accounted for under the series guidance that meets the allocation objective under ASC 606.\n80\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 4.

(“21st Century Fox”) on June 28, 2013 (the “Separation”).\nAnnual Impairment Assessments\nFiscal 2021\nIn accordance with ASC 350, the Company’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or earlier if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair values below their carrying amounts. See Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nThe performance of the Company’s annual impairment analysis resulted in\nno\nimpairments to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2021. Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were discount rates (ranging from\n8.0\n% to\n22.0\n%), long-term growth rates (ranging from\n0.0\n% to\n3.0\n%) and royalty rates (ranging from\n0.25\n% to\n6.0\n%). Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method were EBITDA multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums (ranging from\n5.0\n% to\n10.0\n%). Significant increases (decreases) in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, assuming no change in discount rates, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Significant decreases (increases) in discount rates, assuming no changes in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.\nFiscal 2020\nThe performance of the Company’s annual impairment analysis resulted in $\n89\nmillion of impairments to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2020, primarily related to goodwill at a reporting unit within the News Media segment. Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were discount rates (ranging from\n9.0\n% to\n22.5\n%), long-term growth rates (ranging from\n0.0\n% to\n3.0\n%) and royalty rates (ranging from\n0.25\n% to\n6.0\n%). Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method were EBITDA multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums (ranging from\n5.0\n% to\n10.0\n%). Significant increases (decreases) in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, assuming no change in discount rates, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Significant decreases (increases) in discount rates, assuming no changes in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.\nFoxtel:\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges totaling $\n931\nmillion related to the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at its Foxtel reporting unit. Due to the impact of adverse trends\n87\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nresulting from lower expected broadcast subscribers and the impact that COVID-19 was expected to have on advertising, streaming and commercial subscriber revenues in the near term, the Company revised its future outlook which resulted in a reduction in expected future cash flows of the business. As a result, the Company determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value and recorded non-cash impairment charges of $\n882\nmillion to goodwill and $\n49\nmillion to indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assumptions utilized in the income approach valuation method for Foxtel were discount rates ranging from\n10.5\n% to\n11.5\n%, a long-term growth rate of\n2.0\n% and a royalty rate of\n1.5\n%.

See Note 4—Acquisitions, Disposals and Other Transactions. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, in addition to the write-down to fair value less costs to sell, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $\n235\nmillion related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at the News America Marketing reporting unit. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, as a result of the Company’s review of strategic options for the News America Marketing business and other market indicators, the Company determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value. As a result, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $\n122\nmillion to goodwill and $\n113\nmillion to indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assumptions utilized in the income approach valuation method for News America Marketing were discount rates ranging from\n17.0\n% to\n18.5\n% and long-term growth rates ranging from\n0.6\n% to\n1.5\n%.\nFiscal 2019\nThe performance of the Company’s annual impairment analysis resulted in impairments of $\n87\nmillion to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2019, primarily related to goodwill at a reporting unit within the News Media segment. Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were discount rates (ranging from\n9.0\n% to\n25.0\n%), long-term growth rates (ranging from\n0.0\n% to\n3.0\n%) and royalty rates (ranging from\n0.5\n% to\n6.0\n%). Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method were EBITDA multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums (ranging from\n5\n% to\n10\n%). Significant increases (decreases) in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, assuming no change in discount rates, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Significant decreases (increases) in discount rates, assuming no changes in royalty rates, growth rates, control premiums and multiples, would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement.\n88\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 9.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nIn accordance with ASC 820, fair value measurements are required to be disclosed using a three-tiered fair value hierarchy which distinguishes market participant assumptions into the following categories:\n•\nLevel 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. The Company could value assets and liabilities included in this level using dealer and broker quotations, certain pricing models, bid prices, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\n•\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. For the Company, this primarily includes the use of forecasted financial information and other valuation related assumptions such as discount rates and long term growth rates in the income approach as well as the market approach which utilizes certain market and transaction multiples.\n93\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUnder ASC 820, certain assets and liabilities are required to be remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period.\nThe following table summarizes those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\n________________________\n(a)\nThe Company determined that its cross-currency interest rate derivatives are no longer considered highly effective as of December 31, 2020 primarily due to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.\n(b)\nSee Note 6—Investments.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company reclassified its investment in Tremor from Level 3 to Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as the sale restrictions are expected to lapse within 12 months.\nEquity securities\nThe fair values of equity securities with quoted prices in active markets are determined based on the closing price at the end of each reporting period. These securities are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy outlined above. The fair values of equity securities without readily determinable fair market values are determined based on cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes in fair value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. These securities are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy outlined above.\n94\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nA rollforward of the Company’s equity securities classified as Level 3 is as follows:\n________________________\n(a)\nIncludes purchases of equity securities as well as the equity securities received as consideration for the sale of Unruly to Tremor in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.\n(b)\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company reclassified its investment in Tremor from Level 3 to Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as the sale restrictions are expected to lapse within 12 months.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company is directly and indirectly affected by risks associated with changes in certain market conditions. When deemed appropriate, the Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate the potential impact of these market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative instruments include:\n•\nforeign currency exchange rate risk: arising primarily through Foxtel Debt Group borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars, payments for customer premise equipment and certain programming rights; and\n•\ninterest rate risk: arising from fixed and floating rate Foxtel Debt Group borrowings.\nThe Company formally designates qualifying derivatives as hedge relationships (“hedges”) and applies hedge accounting when considered appropriate. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nDerivatives are classified as current or non-current in the Balance Sheets based on their maturity dates. Refer to the table below for further details:\n(a)\nThe Company determined that its cross-currency interest rate derivatives are no longer considered highly effective as of December 31, 2020 primarily due to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.\nCash flow hedges\nThe Company utilizes a combination of foreign currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives to mitigate currency exchange and interest rate risk in relation to future interest and principal payments and payments for customer premise equipment and certain programming rights.\nThe total notional value of foreign currency contract derivatives designated for hedging was $\n18\nmillion as of June 30, 2021. The maximum hedged term over which the Company is hedging exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is one year. As of June 30,\n95\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2021, the Company estimates that approximately $\n1\nmillion of net derivative losses related to its foreign currency contract derivative cash flow hedges included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into the Statements of Operations within the next 12 months.\nThe total notional value of interest rate swap derivatives designated for hedging was approximately A$\n300\nmillion as of June 30, 2021. The maximum hedged term over which the Company is hedging exposure to variability in interest payments is to September 2022. As of June 30, 2021, the Company estimates that approximately $\n5\nmillion of net derivative losses related to its interest rate swap derivative cash flow hedges included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into the Statements of Operations within the next 12 months.\nCash flow derivatives\nThe Company utilizes cross-currency interest rate derivatives to mitigate currency exchange and interest rate risk in relation to future interest and principal payments. The Company determined that these cash flow hedges no longer qualified as highly effective as of December 31, 2020 primarily due to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates. Amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss during the periods the hedges were considered highly effective will continue to be reclassified out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss over the remaining term of the derivatives. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives will be recognized within Other, net in the Statements of Operations on a prospective basis.\nThe total notional value of cross-currency interest rate swaps for which the Company discontinued hedge accounting was approximately $\n280\nmillion as of June 30, 2021. The maximum hedged term over which the Company is hedging exposure to variability in interest and principal payments is to July 2024. As of June 30, 2021, the Company estimates that approximately $\n5\nmillion of net derivative gains related to its cross-currency interest rate swap derivative cash flow hedges included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into the Statements of Operations within the next 12 months.\nThe following table presents the impact that changes in the fair values had on Accumulated other comprehensive loss and the Statements of Operations during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 for both derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that continue to be highly effective and derivatives initially designated as cash flow hedges but for which hedge accounting was discontinued as of December 31, 2020:\nThe gain resulting from the changes in fair value of cross-currency interest rate derivatives that were discontinued as cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $\n11\nmillion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.\n96\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFair value hedges\nBorrowings issued at fixed rates and in U.S. dollars expose the Company to fair value interest rate risk and currency exchange rate risk. The Company manages fair value interest rate risk and currency exchange rate risk through the use of cross-currency interest rate swaps under which the Company exchanges fixed interest payments equivalent to the interest payments on the U.S. dollar denominated debt for floating rate Australian dollar denominated interest payments. The changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged items are recognized in Other, net. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, such adjustments increased the carrying value of borrowings by\nnil\n.\nThe total notional value of the fair value hedges was approximately $\n70\nmillion as of June 30, 2021. The maximum hedged term over which the Company is hedging exposure to variability in interest payments is to July 2024.\nDuring fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, the amount recognized in the Statements of Operations on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges related to the ineffective portion was nil and the Company excluded the currency basis from the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.\nThe following sets forth the effect of fair value hedging relationships on hedged items in the Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2021 and 2020:\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\nIn addition to assets and liabilities that are remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company has certain assets, primarily goodwill, intangible assets, equity method investments and property, plant and equipment, that are not required to be remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors whether events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair values of these assets below their carrying amounts. If the Company determines that these assets are impaired, the Company would write down these assets to fair value. These nonrecurring fair value measurements are considered to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $\n203\nmillion related to fixed assets in the U.K. and Australia. See Note 7—Property, Plant and Equipment. The carrying values of property, plant and equipment subsequent to the impairment charges at the Australian and U.K. newspapers reporting units were $\n235\nmillion and $\n207\nmillion, respectively.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $\n882\nmillion and $\n49\nmillion related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively, at its Foxtel reporting unit. The carrying value of goodwill at Foxtel decreased from $\n1,668\nmillion to $\n786\nmillion and the value of indefinite-lived intangible assets decreased from $\n189\nmillion to $\n140\nmillion. See Note 8—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of $\n122\nmillion and $\n113\nmillion related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively, at the News America Marketing reporting unit. The carrying value of goodwill at News America Marketing decreased from $\n122\nmillion to\nnil\nand the value of indefinite-lived intangible assets decreased from $\n308\nmillion to $\n195\nmillion. See Note 8—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\nOther Fair Value Measurements\nAs of June 30, 2021, the carrying value of the Company’s outstanding borrowings approximates the fair value. The 2021 Senior Notes and the U.S. private placement borrowings are classified as Level 2 and the remaining borrowings are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n97\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 12. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nAuthorized Capital Stock\nThe Company’s authorized capital stock consists of\n1,500,000,000\nshares of Class A Common Stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share,\n750,000,000\nshares of Class B Common Stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share,\n25,000,000\nshares of Series Common Stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share, and\n25,000,000\nshares of Preferred Stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share.\nCommon Stock and Preferred Stock\nShares Outstanding\n—As of June 30, 2021, the Company had approximately\n391\nmillion shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding at a par value of $\n0.01\nper share and approximately\n200\nmillion shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding at a par value of $\n0.01\nper share. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had\nno\nshares of Series Common Stock or Preferred Stock outstanding.\nDividends—\nThe following table summarizes the dividends declared and paid per share on both the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock:\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders, if any, is within the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors”). The Board of Directors’ decisions regarding the payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including the Company’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual restrictions, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant.\nVoting Rights\n—Holders of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are entitled to vote only in the limited circumstances set forth in the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter”). Holders of the Company’s Class B Common Stock are entitled to\none\nvote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders.\nLiquidation Rights\n—In the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock shall be entitled to receive all of the remaining assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders, ratably in proportion to the number of shares held by Class A Common Stock holders and Class B Common Stock holders, respectively. In the event of any merger or consolidation with or into another entity, the holders of Class A Common Stock and the holders of Class B Common Stock shall generally be entitled to receive substantially identical per share consideration.\nUnder the Company’s Charter, the Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock or series common stock at any time, without stockholder approval, in one or more series and to fix the number of shares, designations, voting powers, if any, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other rights of such series, as well as any applicable qualifications, limitations or restrictions, to the full extent permitted by Delaware law, subject to the limitations set forth in the Charter, including stockholder approval requirements with respect to the issuance of preferred stock or series common stock entitling holders thereof to more than one vote per share.\nStock Repurchases\nIn May 2013, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $\n500\nmillion of its Class A Common Stock.\nNo\nstock repurchases were made during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Over the life of the program through July 30, 2021, the Company cumulatively repurchased approximately\n5.2\nmillion shares of Class A Common Stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $\n71\nmillion. The remaining authorized amount under the stock repurchase program as of July 30, 2021 was approximately $\n429\nmillion. All decisions regarding any future stock repurchases are at the sole discretion of a duly appointed committee of the Board of Directors and management. The committee’s decisions regarding future stock repurchases will be evaluated from time to time in light of many factors, including the Company’s financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and debt facility covenants, other contractual restrictions, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, market volatility and other factors that the committee may deem relevant. The stock repurchase\n98\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nauthorization may be modified, extended, suspended or discontinued at any time by the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors cannot provide any assurances that any additional shares will be repurchased.\nThe Company did not purchase any of its Class A or Class B Common Stock during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nStockholder Rights Agreement\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Board of Directors adopted the fourth amended and restated rights agreement, which is referred to below as the “rights agreement.” Under the rights agreement, each outstanding share of common stock of the Company has attached to it\none\nright. Initially, the rights are represented by the common stock of the Company, are not traded separately from the common stock and are not exercisable. The rights, unless redeemed or exchanged, will become exercisable for common stock of the Company\n10\nbusiness days after the earlier of public announcement that a person or group has obtained beneficial ownership (defined to include stock which a person has the right to acquire, regardless of whether such right is subject to the passage of time or the satisfaction of conditions) of\n15\n% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock or launch of a tender offer to do so. Following such acquisition of beneficial ownership, each right will entitle its holder (other than the acquiring person or group) to purchase, at the exercise price (subject to adjustments provided in the rights agreement), a number of shares of the Company’s Class A or Class B Common Stock, as applicable, having a then-current market value of twice the exercise price, and in the event of a subsequent merger or other acquisition of the Company or transfer of more than 50% of the Company or its assets, to purchase, at the exercise price, a number of shares of common stock of the acquiring entity having a then-current market value of twice the exercise price. The exercise price for the Company rights will be $\n90.00\n, subject to certain adjustments.\nThe rights will not become exercisable by virtue of (i) any person’s or group’s beneficial ownership, as of June 28, 2013 (the “Distribution Date”), of\n15\n% or more of the Class B Common Stock of the Company, unless such person or group acquires beneficial ownership of additional shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock after June 16, 2021; (ii) the repurchase of the Company’s shares that causes a holder to become the beneficial owner of\n15\n% or more of the Company’s Class B Common Stock, unless such holder acquires beneficial ownership of additional shares representing one percent or more of the Company’s Class B Common Stock; (iii) acquisitions by way of a pro rata stock dividend or a stock split; (iv) acquisitions solely as a result of any unilateral grant of any security by the Company or through the exercise of any options, warrants, rights or similar interests (including restricted stock) granted by the Company to its directors, officers and employees pursuant to any equity incentive or award plan; or (v) certain acquisitions determined by the Board of Directors to be inadvertent, provided, that following such acquisition, the acquirer promptly, but in any case within\n10\nbusiness days, divests a sufficient number of shares so that such person would no longer otherwise qualify as an acquiring person.\nThe rights will expire on June 18, 2022, unless the rights agreement is earlier terminated or such date is advanced or extended by the Company, or the rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company. The description of the rights agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the rights agreement, including the form of the Certificate of Designations attached as an exhibit thereto.\nNOTE 13. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION\nEmployees, Directors and other service providers of the Company (“participants”) are eligible to participate in the News Corporation 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the “2013 LTIP”), which provides for equity-based compensation including performance stock units (“PSUs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and other types of awards. The Company has the ability to award up to\n50\nmillion shares of Class A Common Stock under the terms of the 2013 LTIP. All shares of Class A Common Stock reserved for cancelled or forfeited equity-based compensation awards under the 2013 LTIP become available for future grants. In addition, shares of Class A Common Stock are issuable pursuant to certain stock option awards assumed by the Company in connection with acquisitions.\n99\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s equity-based compensation expense reported in the Statements of Operations:\nAs of June 30, 2021, the total compensation cost not yet recognized for all unvested awards held by participants was approximately $\n70\nmillion and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of between\none\nand\ntwo years\n. The total intrinsic value of all outstanding awards was approximately $\n275\nmillion as of June 30, 2021.\nThe tax benefit recognized on PSUs and RSUs for participants that vested and stock options that were exercised by participants during the applicable fiscal year was $\n18\nmillion, $\n24\nmillion and $\n16\nmillion for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSummary of Incentive Plans\nThe fair value of equity-based compensation granted under the 2013 LTIP is calculated according to the type of award issued. Cash-settled awards are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period.\nPerformance Stock Units\nPSUs are grants that entitle the holder to shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock or the cash equivalent value of such shares based on the achievement of pre-established performance metrics over the applicable performance period. The fair value of PSUs is determined on the date of grant and expensed using a straight-line method over the applicable vesting period. The expense is adjusted to reflect the number of shares expected to vest based on management’s determination of the probable achievement of the pre-established performance metrics. The Company records a cumulative adjustment in periods in which its estimate of the number of shares expected to vest changes. Additionally, the Company ultimately adjusts the expense recognized to reflect the actual vested shares following the final determination of the achievement of the performance conditions. Any person who holds PSUs shall have no ownership interest in the shares or cash to which such PSUs relate unless and until the shares or cash are delivered to the holder. Each PSU is entitled to receive dividend equivalents for each regular cash dividend on the Class A Common Stock paid by the Company during the award period, subject to the same terms and conditions as apply to the underlying award.\nDuring fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, certain participants in the 2013 LTIP received grants of PSUs which have a\nthree\n-year performance measurement period. The number of shares that will be issued upon vesting of these PSUs can range from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of the target award, subject to\nthree\n-year performance conditions consisting of a combination of cumulative business-unit-specific revenue, EBITDA (as defined in Note 9—Borrowings) and free cash flow, or the Company’s cumulative earnings per share, cumulative free cash flow and\nthree\n-year total stockholder return relative to the individual companies that comprise the Standard and Poor’s 1500 Media Index. In addition, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, certain participants other than named executive officers of the Company also received grants of PSUs which have a\none\n-year performance measurement period. The number of shares that will be issued upon vesting of these PSUs can range from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of the target award, subject to\none\n-year performance conditions consisting of a combination of business-unit-specific revenue and free cash flow or Company earnings per share and free cash flow.\nDuring fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company granted approximately\n1.6\nmillion,\n2.1\nmillion and\n6.0\nmillion PSUs, respectively, at target to participants, of which approximately\n0.8\nmillion,\n1.2\nmillion and\n4.3\nmillion PSUs, respectively, will be settled in Class A Common Stock, with the remaining PSUs, which are granted to executive Directors and to employees in certain foreign locations, being settled in cash, assuming performance conditions are met.\nDuring fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, approximately\n3.6\nmillion,\n6.3\nmillion and\n4.2\nmillion PSUs respectively, vested, of which approximately\n1.2\nmillion,\n1.6\nmillion and\n1.1\nmillion PSUs, respectively, were settled in cash for approximately $\n18\nmillion, $\n21\nmillion and $\n15\nmillion, respectively, before statutory tax withholdings.\n100\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRestricted Stock Units\nRSUs are grants that entitle the holder to shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock or the cash equivalent value of such shares. The fair value of RSUs is based upon the fair market value of the shares underlying the awards on the grant date and expensed using a straight-line method over the applicable vesting period. Any person who holds RSUs shall have no ownership interest in the shares or cash to which such RSUs relate unless and until the shares or cash are delivered to the holder. Each RSU is entitled to receive dividend equivalents for each regular cash dividend on the Class A Common Stock paid by the Company during the award period, subject to the same terms and conditions as apply to the underlying award.\nDuring fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, certain participants in the 2013 LTIP received grants of time-vested RSUs. Vesting of the awards is subject to the participants’ continued service with the Company through the applicable vesting date. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019,\n3.4\nmillion,\n4.2\nmillion and\n1.1\nmillion RSUs, respectively, were granted to participants. Of the awards granted during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, approximately\n1.0\nmillion and\n0.9\nmillion RSUs, respectively, which are granted to employees in certain foreign locations, will be settled in cash, with the remaining RSUs outstanding being settled in Class A Common Stock. These RSUs have graded vesting primarily over\nthree years\n.\nDuring fiscal 2021, approximately\n1.6\nmillion RSUs vested, of which approximately\n0.3\nmillion RSUs were settled in cash for approximately $\n4\nmillion before statutory tax withholdings.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to the target PSUs and RSUs granted to participants that will be settled in shares of the Company (PSUs and RSUs in thousands):\n________________________\n(a)\nFor fiscal 2021, includes\n0.8\nmillion target PSUs and\n2.4\nmillion RSUs granted and a payout adjustment of\n0.3\nmillion PSUs due to the actual performance level achieved for PSUs granted in fiscal 2018 that vested during fiscal 2021.\nFor fiscal 2020, includes\n1.1\nmillion target PSUs and\n3.3\nmillion RSUs granted and a payout adjustment of\n0.1\nmillion\nPSUs due to the actual performance level achieved for PSUs granted in fiscal 2019 that vested during fiscal 2020.\nFor fiscal 2019, includes\n3.8\nmillion target PSUs and\n1.1\nmillion RSUs granted and a payout adjustment of\n0.5\nmillion\nPSUs due to the actual performance level achieved for PSUs granted in fiscal 2018 that vested during fiscal 2019.\n(b)\nThe fair value of PSUs and RSUs held by participants that vested during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n49\nmillion, $\n79\nmillion and $\n52\nmillion, respectively.\n(c)\nFor fiscal 2021, includes\n0.3\nmillion of target PSUs and\n0.3\nmillion RSUs cancelled.\nFor fiscal 2020, includes\n0.4\nmillion of target PSUs and\n0.7\nmillion RSUs cancelled and a payout adjustment of\n0.4\nmillion PSUs due to the actual performance level achieved for PSUs granted in fiscal 2017 that vested during fiscal 2020.\nFor fiscal 2019, includes\n0.6\nmillion of target PSUs and\n0.1\nmillion RSUs cancelled and a payout adjustment of\n0.3\nmillion PSUs due to the actual performance level achieved for PSUs granted in fiscal 2016 that vested during fiscal 2019.\n101\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nStock Options\nThe following table summarizes information about stock option transactions for the employee stock option plans (options in thousands):\n________________________\n(a)\nThe weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding and exercisable as of June 30, 2021 was approximately\n2.00\nyears.\nNOTE 14. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nThe following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share under ASC 260, “Earnings per Share”:\n________________________\n(a)\nThe dilutive impact of the Company’s PSUs, RSUs and stock options has been excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 because their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect on the net loss per share.\nNOTE 15. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nRelated Party Transactions\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into transactions with related parties to purchase and/or sell advertising and administrative services. The Company has also previously entered into transactions with related parties to sell certain broadcast rights.\nThe following table sets forth the net revenue from related parties included in the Statements of Operations:\n102\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table sets forth the amount of receivables due from and payables due to related parties outstanding on the Balance Sheets:\nNOTE 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCommitments\nThe Company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements (“firm commitments”) to make future payments. These firm commitments secure the current and future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s material firm commitments as of June 30, 2021:\n________________________\n(a)\nThe Company has commitments under purchase obligations related to minimum subscriber guarantees for license fees, printing contracts, capital projects, marketing agreements, production services and other legally binding commitments.\n(b)\nThe Company has sports programming rights commitments with the National Rugby League, Australian Football League and Cricket Australia, as well as certain other broadcast rights which are payable through fiscal 2028.\n(c)\nThe Company has programming rights commitments with various suppliers for programming content.\n(d)\nThe Company leases office facilities, warehouse facilities, printing plants, satellite services and equipment. These leases, which are classified as operating leases, are expected to be paid at certain dates through fiscal 2048. Amounts reflected represent only the Company’s lease obligations for which it has firm commitments.\n(e)\nThe Company has contractual commitments for satellite transmission services. The Company’s satellite transponder services arrangements extend through fiscal 2032 and are accounted for as operating or finance leases, based on the underlying terms of those arrangements.\n(f)\nSee Note 9—Borrowings.\n(g)\nReflects the Company’s expected future interest payments on borrowings outstanding and interest rates applicable at June 30, 2021. Such rates are subject to change in future periods. See Note 9—Borrowings.\nContingencies\nThe Company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings, claims and governmental inspections or investigations, including those discussed below. The outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty, and the Company often\n103\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ncannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters. Fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the Company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. Legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred. Except as otherwise provided below, for the contingencies disclosed for which there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, the Company was unable to estimate the amount of loss or range of loss. The Company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable.\nNews America Marketing\nIn May 2020, the Company sold its News America Marketing business. In the Disposition, the Company retained certain liabilities, including those arising from the legal proceedings with Insignia and Valassis described below.\nInsignia Systems, Inc.\nOn July 11, 2019, Insignia filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota against News America Marketing FSI L.L.C. (“NAM FSI”), News America Marketing In-Store Services L.L.C. (“NAM In-Store”) and News Corporation (together, the “NAM Parties”) alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and common law business torts. The complaint seeks treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees and costs. On August 14, 2019, the NAM Parties answered the complaint and asserted a counterclaim against Insignia for breach of contract, alleging that Insignia violated a prior settlement agreement between NAM In-Store and Insignia. On July 10, 2020, each of the NAM Parties and Insignia filed a motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim. On December 7, 2020, the court denied Insignia’s motion and granted the NAM Parties’ motion in part and denied it in part. The court found that Insignia had breached the prior settlement agreement and struck the allegations in Insignia’s complaint that violated the agreement. While it is not possible at this time to predict with any degree of certainty the ultimate outcome of this action, the NAM Parties believe they have been compliant with applicable laws and intend to defend themselves vigorously.\nValassis Communications, Inc.\nOn November 8, 2013, Valassis filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (the “District Court”) against the NAM Parties and News America Incorporated (together, the “NAM Group”) alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and common law business torts. The complaint seeks treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees and costs.\nOn December 19, 2013, the NAM Group filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and on March 30, 2016, the District Court dismissed Valassis’s bundling and tying claims. On September 25, 2017, the District Court granted Valassis’s motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “N.Y. District Court”). On April 13, 2018, the NAM Group filed a motion for summary judgment dismissing the case which was granted in part and denied in part by the N.Y. District Court on February 21, 2019. The N.Y. District Court found that the NAM Group’s bidding practices were lawful but denied its motion with respect to claims arising out of certain other alleged contracting practices. In addition, the N.Y. District Court also dismissed Valassis’s claims relating to free-standing insert products. The trial began on June 29, 2021 and on July 18, 2021, the parties agreed to settle the litigation, and Valassis’s claims were dismissed with prejudice on July 19, 2021.\nHarperCollins\nBeginning in February 2021, a number of purported class action complaints have been filed in the N.Y. District Court against Amazon.com, Inc. and certain publishers, including the Company’s subsidiary, HarperCollins Publishers, L.L.C. (“HarperCollins”), alleging violations of antitrust and competition laws. The complaints seek treble damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees and costs. While it is not possible at this time to predict with any degree of certainty the ultimate outcome of these actions, HarperCollins believes it has been compliant with applicable laws and intends to defend itself vigorously.\n104\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nU.K. Newspaper Matters\nCivil claims have been brought against the Company with respect to, among other things, voicemail interception and inappropriate payments to public officials at the Company’s former publication,\nThe News of the World\n, and at\nThe Sun\n, and related matters (the “U.K. Newspaper Matters”). The Company has admitted liability in many civil cases and has settled a number of cases. The Company also settled a number of claims through a private compensation scheme which was closed to new claims after April 8, 2013.\nIn connection with the Separation, the Company and 21st Century Fox agreed in the Separation and Distribution Agreement that 21st Century Fox would indemnify the Company for payments made after the Distribution Date arising out of civil claims and investigations relating to the U.K. Newspaper Matters as well as legal and professional fees and expenses paid in connection with the previously concluded criminal matters, other than fees, expenses and costs relating to employees (i) who are not directors, officers or certain designated employees or (ii) with respect to civil matters, who are not co-defendants with the Company or 21st Century Fox. 21st Century Fox’s indemnification obligations with respect to these matters are settled on an after-tax basis. In March 2019, as part of the separation of FOX Corporation (“FOX”) from 21st Century Fox, the Company, News Corp Holdings UK & Ireland, 21st Century Fox and FOX entered into a Partial Assignment and Assumption Agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, 21st Century Fox assigned, conveyed and transferred to FOX all of its indemnification obligations with respect to the U.K. Newspaper Matters.\nThe net expense related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters in Selling, general and administrative was $\n10\nmillion, $\n8\nmillion and $\n10\nmillion for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has provided for its best estimate of the liability for the claims that have been filed and costs incurred, including liabilities associated with employment taxes, and has accrued approximately $\n47\nmillion. The amount to be indemnified by FOX of approximately $\n55\nmillion was recorded as a receivable in Other current assets on the Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2021. The net expense for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 reflects a $\n5\nmillion impact from the reversal of a portion of the Company’s previously accrued liability and the corresponding receivable from FOX as the result of an agreement reached with the relevant tax authority with respect to certain employment taxes. It is not possible to estimate the liability or corresponding receivable for any additional claims that may be filed given the information that is currently available to the Company. If more claims are filed and additional information becomes available, the Company will update the liability provision and corresponding receivable for such matters.\nThe Company is not able to predict the ultimate outcome or cost of the civil claims. It is possible that these proceedings and any adverse resolution thereof could damage its reputation, impair its ability to conduct its business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nOther\nThe Company’s tax returns are subject to on-going review and examination by various tax authorities. Tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the Company’s tax returns, and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable.\nThe Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid; however, these liabilities may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as tax examinations continue to progress, or as settlements or litigations occur.\nNOTE 17. RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS\nThe Company’s employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the Company and its subsidiaries. Plans in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and other foreign plans are accounted for as defined benefit pension plans. Accordingly, the funded and unfunded position of each plan is recorded in the Balance Sheets. Actuarial gains and losses that have not yet been recognized through net income are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. The determination of benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to the plans are dependent on various assumptions. The major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets and mortality rates. Management develops each assumption using relevant company experience in conjunction with market-related data for each individual country in which such plans exist. The funded\n105\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nstatus of the plans can change from year to year, but the assets of the funded plans have been sufficient to pay all benefits that came due in each of fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nSummary of Funded Status\nThe Company uses a June 30 measurement date for all pension and postretirement benefit plans. The combined domestic and foreign pension and postretirement benefit plans resulted in a net pension and postretirement benefits liability of $\n102\nmillion and $\n194\nmillion at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company recognized these amounts in the Balance Sheets at June 30, 2021 and 2020 as follows:\n106\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table sets forth the change in the projected benefit obligation, change in the fair value of the Company’s plan assets and funded status:\n________________________\n(a)\nAmounts related to payments made to former employees of the Company in full settlement of their deferred pension benefits. The U.S. plan settlements in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 are primarily the result of the disposition of the Company's News America Marketing business in May 2020.\n(b)\nActuarial losses for fiscal 2021 related to domestic pension plans and for fiscal 2020 related to domestic and foreign pension plans primarily relate to the decrease in discount rates used in measuring plan obligations as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Actuarial gains for fiscal 2021 related to international pension plans primarily relate to the increase in discount rates used in measuring plan obligations as of June 30, 2021.\n107\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAmounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss consist of:\nAccumulated pension benefit obligations as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $\n1,457\nmillion and $\n1,397\nmillion, respectively.\nBelow is information about funded and unfunded pension plans:\nThe accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets for all domestic pension plans.\nBelow is information about foreign pension plans in which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the plan assets:\nSummary of Net Periodic Benefit Costs\nThe Company recorded $(\n1\n) million, $\n7\nmillion and $(\n2\n) million in net periodic benefit (income) costs in the Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company utilizes the full yield-curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit (income) costs for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\n108\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe amortization of amounts related to unrecognized prior service costs (credits), deferred losses and settlements, curtailments and other were reclassified out of Other comprehensive income as a component of net periodic benefit costs. The components of net periodic benefits (income) costs were as follows:\n________________________\nN/A—not applicable\nThe following assumed health care cost trend rates as of June 30 were also used in accounting for postretirement benefits:\n109\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table sets forth the estimated benefit payments for the next five fiscal years, and in aggregate for the five fiscal years thereafter. The expected benefits are estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company’s benefit obligation at the end of the fiscal year and include benefits attributable to estimated future employee service:\nPlan Assets\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC 715, which requires disclosures including: (i) investment policies and strategies; (ii) the major categories of plan assets; (iii) the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure plan assets; (iv) the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period; and (v) significant concentrations of risk within plan assets.\nThe table below presents the Company’s plan assets by level within the fair value hierarchy, as described in Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, as of June 30, 2021 and 2020:\n________________________\n(a)\nOpen-ended pooled funds that are registered and/or available to the general public are valued at the daily published net asset value (“NAV”). Other pooled funds are valued at the NAV provided by the fund issuer.\n110\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of investments reflected as Level 3 assets as of June 30, 2021 and 2020:\nThe Company’s investment strategy for its pension plans is to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets within an acceptable level of risk in order to minimize the cost of providing pension benefits while maintaining adequate funding levels. The Company’s practice is to conduct a periodic strategic review of its asset allocation. The Company’s current broad strategic targets are to have a pension asset portfolio comprised of\n20\n% equity securities,\n73\n% fixed income securities and\n7\n% in cash and other investments. In developing the expected long-term rate of return, the Company considered the pension asset portfolio’s past average rate of returns and future return expectations of the various asset classes. A portion of the other allocation is reserved in cash to provide for expected benefits to be paid in the short term. The Company’s equity portfolios are managed in such a way as to achieve optimal diversity. The Company’s fixed income portfolio is investment grade in the aggregate. The Company does not manage any assets internally.\nThe Company’s benefit plan weighted-average asset allocations, by asset category, are as follows:\nRequired pension plan contributions for the next fiscal year are expected to be approximately $\n15\nmillion; however, actual contributions may be affected by pension asset and liability valuation changes during the year. The Company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve funded status.\nNOTE 18. OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nMultiemployer Pension and Postretirement Plans\nThe Company contributes to various multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover certain of its union-represented employees, primarily at the newspaper businesses. The risks of participating in these multiemployer pension plans are different from single-employer pension plans in that (i) contributions made by the Company to the multiemployer pension plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating\n111\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nemployers; (ii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in certain of these multiemployer pension plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, which is referred to as a withdrawal liability; and (iii) actions taken by a participating employer that lead to a deterioration of the financial health of a multiemployer pension plan may result in the unfunded obligations of the multiemployer pension plan being borne by its remaining participating employers. While no multiemployer pension plan that the Company contributed to is individually significant to the Company, the Company was listed on certain Form 5500s as providing more than\n5\n% of total contributions based on the current information available. The financial health of a multiemployer plan is indicated by the zone status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which represents the funded status of the plan as certified by the plan’s actuary. In general, plans in the red zone are less than\n65\n% funded, plans in the yellow zone are between\n65\n% and\n80\n% funded, and plans in the green zone are at least\n80\n% funded. The funded status for\ntwo\nof the plans for which the Company was listed as providing more than\n5\n% of total contributions reported green zone status for the most recent available plan year. The funded status for\none\nof the plans for which the Company was listed as providing more than\n5\n% of total contributions reported red zone status for the most recent available plan year. Total contributions made by the Company to multiemployer pension plans for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $\n5\nmillion.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe Company has defined contribution plans for the benefit of substantially all employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. Employer contributions to such plans were $\n142\nmillion, $\n154\nmillion and $\n145\nmillion for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nThe Company has non-qualified deferred compensation plans for the benefit of certain management employees. The investment funds offered to the participants generally correspond to the funds offered in the Company’s 401(k) plan, and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. The unfunded obligations of the plans included in Other liabilities as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $\n51\nmillion and $\n46\nmillion, respectively, and the majority of these plans are closed to new employees.\nNOTE 19. INCOME TAXES\nIncome taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable for the current year and for the impact of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which represent future tax consequences of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using the enacted statutory tax rates and are adjusted for any changes in such rates in the period of change.\nIncome (loss) before income tax expense was attributable to the following jurisdictions:\n112\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe significant components of the Company’s income tax expense were as follows:\nThe reconciliation between the Company’s actual effective tax rate and the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate was as follows:\n________________________\n(a)\nThe Company’s effective tax rate is impacted by the geographic mix of its pre-tax income. The Company’s foreign operations are located primarily in Australia and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). Australia has a higher income tax rate than the U.S. and the U.K. has a lower tax rate than the U.S.\n(b)\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company released valuation allowances related to U.S. Federal, State and foreign deferred tax assets of $\n64\nmillion, $\n5\nmillion and $\n6\nmillion, respectively.\n(c)\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, the Company recorded non-cash charges of $\n1,690\nmillion related to the impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which reduced the Company’s tax expense by $\n262\nmillion. These write-downs have an impact on our effective tax rate to the extent a lower tax benefit is recorded.\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the Company recorded non-cash charges of $\n96\nmillion related to the impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which reduced the Company’s tax expense by $\n10\nmillion. These impairments and write-downs have an impact on our effective tax rate to the extent a lower tax benefit is recorded.\n(d)\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company remeasured U.K. deferred tax assets which includes the enacted corporate income tax increase resulting from the Finance Act 2021.\n113\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(e)\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2019, the effective tax rates of\n14\n% and\n36\n%, respectively, represent income tax expense when compared to consolidated pre-tax book income. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, the effective tax rate of (\n1\n)% represents income tax expense when compared to consolidated pre-tax book loss.\nThe Company recognized deferred income taxes in the Balance Sheets as follows:\nThe significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Company had income tax net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards (gross, net of uncertain tax benefits) in various jurisdictions as follows:\nUtilization of the NOLs is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income from our operations in each of the respective jurisdictions to which the NOLs relate, while taking into account tax filing methodologies and limitations and/or restrictions on our ability to use them. Certain of our U.S. federal NOLs were acquired as part of the acquisitions of Move and Harlequin and are\n114\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nsubject to limitations as promulgated under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). Section 382 of the Code limits the amount of NOLs that we can use on an annual basis to offset consolidated U.S. taxable income. The NOLs are also subject to review by relevant tax authorities in the jurisdictions to which they relate.\nThe Company recorded a deferred tax asset of $\n484\nmillion and $\n578\nmillion associated with its NOLs (net of approximately $\n62\nmillion and $\n53\nmillion, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits recorded against deferred tax assets) as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Significant judgment is applied in assessing our ability to realize our NOLs. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize existing deferred tax assets within the applicable expiration period.\nOn the basis of this evaluation, valuation allowances of $\n206\nmillion and $\n269\nmillion have been established to reduce the deferred tax asset associated with the Company’s NOLs to an amount that will more likely than not be realized as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company released valuation allowances related to U.S. Federal NOLs of $\n64\nmillion as the Company concluded that these deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized.\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Company had approximately $\n2.3\nbillion, $\n1.7\nbillion and $\n15\nmillion of capital loss carryforwards in Australia, the U.K. and the U.S., respectively. Australia and U.K capital loss carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely and the U.S. carryforward will expire in 2026. The capital loss carryforwards are also subject to review by relevant tax authorities in the jurisdictions to which they relate. Realization of our capital losses is dependent on generating capital gain taxable income and satisfying certain continuity of business requirements. The Company recorded a deferred tax asset of $\n1,126\nmillion and $\n886\nmillion as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for these capital loss carryforwards. However, it is more likely than not that the Company will not generate capital gain income in the normal course of business in these jurisdictions. Accordingly, valuation allowances of $\n1,126\nmillion and $\n886\nmillion have been established to reduce the capital loss carryforward deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company released valuation allowances related to U.K. capital losses of $6 million as the Company concluded that these deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized.\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Company had approximately $\n72\nmillion of U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards which includes $\n32\nmillion of foreign tax credits and $\n40\nmillion of research and development credits, which begin to expire in 2026 and 2036, respectively.\nAs of June 30, 2021, the Company had approximately $\n31\nmillion of non-U.S. tax credit carryforwards which expire in various amounts beginning in 2026 and $\n12\nmillion of state tax credit carryforwards (net of U.S. federal benefit), which expire in various amounts beginning in 2021.\nIn accordance with the Company’s accounting policy, a valuation allowance of $\n58\nmillion has been established to reduce the deferred tax asset associated with the Company’s U.S. foreign tax credits, non-U.S. and state credit carryforwards to an amount that will more likely than not be realized as of June 30, 2021. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the Company released valuation allowances related to state tax credits of $\n5\nmillion as the Company concluded that these deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized.\n115\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe following table sets forth the change in the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties:\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalty charges related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense, which is consistent with the recognition in prior reporting periods. The Company recognized a benefit related to interest and penalties of $\n1\nmillion,\nnil\nand $\n1\nmillion for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company recorded liabilities for accrued interest and penalties of approximately $\n4\nmillion, $\n3\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion as of June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company’s tax returns are subject to on-going review and examination by various tax authorities. Tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in our tax returns, and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable. The Company is currently undergoing tax examinations in the U.S., various states and foreign jurisdictions. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Internal Revenue Service commenced an audit of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. The Company effectively settled this audit with no material changes in February 2020. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 the statute of limitations related to our US federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014, 2016 and 2017 expired. No adjustments to our tax provision were recorded as a result of these statute expirations. The Internal Revenue Service has commenced an audit for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid. However, the Company may need to accrue additional income tax expense and our liability may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as these tax examinations continue to progress, or as settlements or litigations occur.\nThe following is a summary of major tax jurisdictions for which tax authorities may assert additional taxes based upon tax years currently under audit and subsequent years that could be audited by the respective taxing authorities.\nIt is reasonably possible that uncertain tax positions may increase or decrease in the next fiscal year, however, actual developments in this area could differ from those currently expected. As of June 30, 2021, approximately $\n44\nmillion would affect the Company’s effective income tax rate, if and when recognized in future fiscal years. It is reasonably possible, the amount of uncertain tax liabilities which may be resolved within the next fiscal year is between the range of approximately\nnil\nand $\n35\nmillion, a portion of which will affect our effective income tax rate, primarily as a result of the settlement of tax examinations and the lapsing of statutes of limitations.\n116\nNEWS CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOther\nPrior to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”), the Company asserted that substantially all of its undistributed earnings were considered indefinitely reinvested and accordingly, no deferred taxes were provided. Pursuant to the provisions promulgated in the Tax Act these earnings were subjected to the one-time transition tax. It is the Company’s intention to reinvest in these subsidiaries indefinitely as the Company does not anticipate the need to repatriate funds to satisfy domestic liquidity needs. An actual repatriation from these subsidiaries could be subject to foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state taxes. Calculation of the unrecognized tax liabilities is not practicable. Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries considered to be indefinitely reinvested amounted to approximately $\n2.9\nbillion as of June 30, 2021.\nDuring the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company paid gross income taxes of $\n176\nmillion, $\n99\nmillion and $\n144\nmillion, respectively, and received income tax refunds of $\n14\nmillion, $\n25\nmillion and $\n18\nmillion, respectively.\nNOTE 20.
