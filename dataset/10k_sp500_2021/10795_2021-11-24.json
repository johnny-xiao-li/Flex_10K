Information with respect to BD’s business segments is included in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and is incorporated herein by reference.\nBD Medical\nBD Medical produces a broad array of medical technologies and devices that are used to help improve healthcare delivery in a wide range of settings. The primary customers served by BD Medical are hospitals and clinics; physicians’ office practices; consumers and retail pharmacies; governmental and nonprofit public health agencies; pharmaceutical companies; and healthcare workers. BD Medical consists of the following organizational units:\n1\nBD Life Sciences\nBD Life Sciences provides products for the safe collection and transport of diagnostics specimens, and instruments and reagent systems to detect a broad range of infectious diseases, healthcare-associated infections and cancers.  In addition, BD Life Sciences produces research and clinical tools that facilitate the study of cells, and the components of cells, to gain a better understanding of normal and disease processes.  That information is used to aid the discovery and development of new drugs and vaccines, and to improve the diagnosis and management of diseases.  The primary customers served by BD Life Sciences are hospitals, laboratories and clinics; blood banks; healthcare workers; public health agencies; physicians’ office practices; retail pharmacies; academic and government institutions; and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. With the emergency use authorization approval of the At Home COVID-19 test, BD Life Sciences also serves patients directly. BD Life Sciences consists of the following organizational units:\nBD Interventional\nBD Interventional provides vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialty products that are intended, with the exception of the V. Mueller™ surgical and laparoscopic instrumentation products, to be used once and then discarded or are either temporarily or permanently implanted.  The primary customers served by BD Interventional are hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care facilities, alternate site facilities, and patients via our Homecare business.  BD Interventional consists of the following organizational units:\n2\nDivestiture\nAdvanced Bioprocessing\nIn October 2018, BD completed the sale of its Life Sciences segment’s Advanced Bioprocessing business pursuant to a definitive agreement that was signed in September 2018.\nAdditional information regarding this divestiture is contained in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nInternational Operations\nBD’s products are manufactured and sold worldwide. For reporting purposes, we organize our operations outside the United States as follows: EMEA (which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa); Greater Asia (which includes countries in Greater China, Japan, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Korea, and Australia and New Zealand); Latin America (which includes Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America); and Canada. BD has manufacturing operations outside the United States in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, China, Dominican Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Geographic information with respect to BD’s operations is included under the heading “Geographic Information” in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nForeign economic conditions and exchange rate fluctuations have caused the profitability related to foreign revenues to fluctuate more than the profitability related to domestic revenues. BD believes its activities in some countries outside the United States involve greater risk than its domestic business due to the factors cited herein, as well as the economic environment, local commercial and economic policies and political uncertainties. See further discussion of these risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nDistribution\nBD’s products are marketed and distributed in the United States and internationally through independent distribution channels, and directly to hospitals and other healthcare institutions by BD and independent sales representatives. BD uses acute care, non-acute care, laboratory and drug wholesaler distributors to broadly support our overall disposable product demand from our end user customers in the United States.  In international markets, products are distributed either directly or through distributors, with the practice varying by country. Order backlog is not material to BD’s business inasmuch as orders for BD products generally are received and filled on a current basis. BD’s worldwide sales are not generally seasonal, with the exception of certain medical devices in the Medication Delivery Solutions business unit, and flu diagnostic products in the Integrated Diagnostic Systems business unit, both of which relate to seasonal diseases such as influenza. In order to service its customers, optimize logistics, lower facilities costs and reduce finished goods inventory levels, BD operates consolidated distribution facilities globally.\nRaw Materials and Components\nBD purchases many different types of raw materials and components, including plastics, glass, metals, textiles, paper products, agricultural products, electronic and mechanical sub-assemblies and various biological, chemical and petrochemical products. BD seeks to ensure continuity of supply by securing multiple options for sourcing. However, there are situations where raw materials and components are only available from one supplier, which are referred to as sole sourced. The use of sole sourced materials and components may be due to sourcing of proprietary and/or patented technology and processes that are intended to provide a unique market differentiation to our product. In other cases, while a raw material or component can be sourced from multiple manufacturers, only one supplier is qualified due to quality assurance, cost or other considerations. In order to provide alternate sources, BD must complete a rigorous qualification process, which most often includes completion of regulatory registration and approval. If clinical trials are not required, this qualification process\n3\ncan take 3-18 months depending on the criticality of the change. When clinical trials are required, this process may lengthen the qualification phase from one to three years. BD continuously assesses its sole sourced raw materials and components, and maintains business continuity plans with its suppliers. BD’s continuity plans may include securing secondary supply with alternate suppliers, qualification of alternate manufacturing facilities, maintaining contingency stock, internal development of supply and establishment of technology escrow accounts. While BD works closely with its suppliers, no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful, and there may be events that cause supply interruption, reduction or termination that adversely impacts BD’s ability to manufacture and sell certain products. See further discussion of the risks related to the supply chain and raw materials in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nResearch and Development\nBD conducts its research and development (“R&D”) activities at its operating units and across global enterprise centers of excellence located in the United States, India, China, Singapore, and Ireland. The majority of BD’s R&D activities are conducted in North America. Outside North America, BD has a significant R&D presence in Greater Asia and Europe. BD also collaborates with certain universities, medical centers and other entities on R&D programs and retains individual consultants and partners to support its efforts in specialized fields.\nIntellectual Property and Licenses\nBD owns significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and trademarks in the United States and other countries. BD is also licensed under domestic and foreign patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and trademarks owned by others. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to BD’s business. BD believes, however, that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to BD’s business as a whole, or to any business segment.\nCompetition\nBD operates in the increasingly complex and challenging medical technology marketplace. Technological advances and scientific discoveries have accelerated the pace of change in medical technology, the regulatory environment of medical products is becoming more complex and vigorous, and economic conditions have resulted in a challenging market. Companies of varying sizes compete in the global medical technology field. Some are more specialized than BD with respect to particular markets, and some have greater financial resources than BD. New companies have entered the field, particularly in the areas of molecular diagnostics, safety-engineered devices and in the life sciences, and established companies have diversified their business activities into the medical technology area. Other firms engaged in the distribution of medical technology products have become manufacturers of medical devices and instruments as well. Acquisitions and collaborations by and among companies seeking a competitive advantage also affect the competitive environment. In addition, the entry into the market of low-cost manufacturers has created increased pricing pressures.  BD competes in this evolving marketplace on the basis of many factors, including price, quality, innovation, service, reputation, distribution and promotion. The impact of these factors on BD’s competitive position varies among BD’s various product offerings. In order to remain competitive in the industries in which it operates, BD continues to make investments in R&D, quality management, quality improvement, product innovation and productivity improvement in support of its core strategies.  See further discussion of the risks relating to competition in the medical technology industry in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThird-Party Reimbursement\nReimbursement is an important strategic consideration in the development and marketing of medical technology. Obtaining coverage, coding and payment is critical to the commercial success of a new product or procedure. Difficulty in achieving market access can lead to slow adoption in the marketplace and inadequate payment levels that can continue for months or even years.\n4\nA majority of BD’s customers rely on third-party payers, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures, products and services they provide. Vertical integration has created a very concentrated market among commercial third-party payers in the U.S.  Global payers are increasingly focused on strategies to control spending on healthcare and reward improvements in quality and patient outcomes.\nBD is actively engaged in identifying and communicating value propositions of its products for payer, provider, and patient stakeholders, and it employs various efforts and resources to attempt to positively impact coverage, coding and payment pathways. However, BD has no direct control over payer decision-making with respect to coverage and payment levels for BD products. The manner and level of reimbursement in any given case may depend on the site of care, the procedure(s) performed, the final patient diagnosis, the device(s) and/or drug(s) utilized, the available budget, or a combination of these factors, and coverage and payment levels are determined at each payer’s discretion. As BD’s product offerings are diverse across a variety of healthcare settings, they are affected to varying degrees by the many payment pathways that impact the decisions of healthcare providers regarding which medical products they purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products. Therefore, changes in reimbursement levels or methods may either positively or negatively impact sales of BD products in any given country for any given product.\nAs government programs expand healthcare coverage for their citizens, they have at the same time sought to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures, products or services. In addition, most payers are seeking price predictability in order to mitigate future exposure to manufacturer price increases. This is coupled with an increase in high deductible private insurance plans, which transfer more pricing exposure and burden directly to the patient.\nMany payers both in the U.S. and globally have developed specific payment and delivery mechanisms to support these cost control efforts and to focus on paying for value. These mechanisms include payment reductions, pay for performance measures, quality-based performance payments, restrictive coverage policies, bidding and tender mechanics, studies to compare the effectiveness of therapies and use of technology assessments. These changes, whether the result of legislation, new strategic alliances or market consolidations, have created an increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective and quality-driven healthcare.\nFor example, as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”), the U.S. has implemented value-based payment methodologies and has created alternative payment models such as bundled payments to continue to drive improved value. We see other governments around the world considering similar bundling reform measures, with the utilization of the Diagnosis Related Gro\nup (“DRG”)\nas a payment mechanism to drive toward quality and resource based reimbursement becoming more common in regions outside the U.S.\nRegulation\nGeneral\nBD's operations are global and are affected by complex state, federal and international laws relating to healthcare, environmental protection, antitrust, anti-corruption, marketing, fraud and abuse (including anti-kickback and false claims laws), export control, product safety and efficacy, employment, privacy and other areas.\nBD’s medical technology products and operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and various other federal and state agencies, as well as by foreign governmental agencies. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of BD’s medical products. The scope of the activities of these agencies, particularly in the Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific regions in which BD operates, has been increasing.\nBD actively maintains FDA/ISO Quality Systems that establish standards for its product design, manufacturing, and distribution processes. Prior to marketing or selling most of its products, BD must secure approval from the FDA and counterpart non-U.S. regulatory agencies. Following the introduction of a product,\n5\nthese agencies engage in periodic reviews and inspections of BD’s quality systems, as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials. These regulatory controls, as well as any changes in agency policies, can affect the time and cost associated with the development, introduction and continued availability of new and existing products. Where possible, BD anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes. These agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against BD, such as product recalls, product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions. BD also undertakes voluntary compliance actions, such as voluntary recalls.\nBD also is subject to various federal and state laws, and laws outside the United States, concerning healthcare fraud and abuse (including false claims laws and anti-kickback laws), global anti-corruption, transportation, safety and health, and customs and exports. Many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years. This is part of a general trend toward increased regulation and enforcement activity within and outside the United States.\nIn addition, as part of PPACA, the federal government has enacted the Sunshine Act provisions requiring BD to publicly report gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals. Countries outside the United States have enacted similar local laws requiring medical device companies to report transfers of value to health care providers licensed in those countries. Failure to comply with these laws could result in a range of fines, penalties and/or other sanctions.\nConsent Decree with FDA\nOur infusion pump organizational unit is operating under an amended consent decree entered into by CareFusion with the FDA in 2007. CareFusion’s consent decree with the FDA is related to its Alaris™ SE infusion pumps. In February 2009, CareFusion and the FDA amended the consent decree to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for CareFusion 303, Inc., the organizational unit that manufactures and sells BD Alaris™ infusion pumps in the United States. The amended consent decree does not apply to intravenous administration sets and accessories.\nWhile this BD organizational unit remains subject to the amended consent decree, which includes the requirements of the original consent decree, it has made substantial progress in its compliance efforts. However, we cannot predict the outcome of this matter, and the amended consent decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing infusion pumps, recall products and take other actions. We may be required to pay damages of $15,000 per day per violation if we fail to comply with any provision of the amended consent decree, up to $15 million per year.\nWe also cannot currently predict whether additional monetary investment will be incurred to resolve this matter or the matter’s ultimate impact on our business. We may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because, among other things, the FDA may determine that we are not fully compliant with the amended consent decree and therefore impose penalties under the amended consent decree, and/or we may be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the amended consent decree, including, but not limited to, fines, penalties, other monetary remedies, and expansion of the terms of the amended consent decree. As of September 30, 2021, we do not believe that a loss is probable in connection with the amended consent decree, and accordingly, we have no accruals associated with compliance with the amended consent decree.\nWe are undertaking certain remediation of our BD Alaris System, and are currently shipping the product in the U.S., only in cases of medical necessity and to remediate recalled software versions.  We will not be able to fully resume commercial operations for the BD Alaris System in the U.S. until a 510(k) submission relating to the product has been cleared by the FDA. No assurances can be given as to when or if clearance will be obtained from the FDA.\nFollowing an inspection that began in March 2020 of our Medication Management Systems facility (CareFusion 303, Inc.) in San Diego, California, the FDA issued to BD a Form 483 Notice that contains a number of observations of non-conformance. BD has provided the FDA with its response to the Form 483 and has begun to implement certain corrective actions to address the observations. However, the FDA’s review of the items raised in the Form 483 remains ongoing and no assurances can be given regarding further action by\n6\nthe FDA as a result of the observations, including but not limited to action pursuant to the amended consent decree.\nFDA Warning Letter\nOn January 11, 2018, BD received a Warning Letter from the FDA with respect to our former BD Preanalytical Systems (\"PAS\") unit, citing certain alleged violations of quality system regulations and of law. The Warning Letter states that, until BD resolves the outstanding issues covered by the Warning Letter, the FDA will not clear or approve any premarket submissions for Class III devices to which the non-conformances are reasonably related or grant requests for certificates to foreign governments. BD has worked closely with the FDA and implemented corrective actions to address the quality management system concerns identified in the warning letter.\nIn March 2020, the FDA conducted a subsequent inspection of PAS, which it classified as Voluntary Action Indicated, which means the FDA will not take or recommend any administrative or regulatory action as a result of the unit’s response to the observations associated with the quality management concerns in the inspection.\nBD continues to work with the FDA to generate additional clinical evidence and file 510(k)s as remaining commitments associated with the Warning Letter. The FDA review of these remaining commitments is ongoing and no assurances can be given regarding further action by the FDA as a result of these commitments, including but not limited to action pursuant to the Warning Letter.\nConsent Order - Covington, Georgia, USA\nOn October 28, 2019, BD entered into a consent order with the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (the “EPD”), following the filing of a complaint and motion for temporary restraining order by the EPD seeking to enjoin BD from continuing sterilization operations at its Covington, Georgia facility.  Under the terms of the consent order,\nwhich has been amended two times upon mutual agreement of BD and EPD, BD voluntarily agreed to a nu\nmber of operational changes at its Covington and Madison, Georgia facilities, as well as at its distribution center in Covington, designed to further reduce ethylene oxide emissions, including but not limited to operating at a reduced capacity.  BD does not believe that the consent order will have a material impact on its operations.  Violation of the consent order, though, could subject us to additional restrictions on the sterilization operations at our Covington and Madison facilities.  BD has business continuity plans in place to mitigate the impact of any additional restrictions on our operations at these facilities, although it is possible that these plans will not be able to fully offset such impact, especially considering the reduced capacity of third-party sterilization service providers and the regulatory timelines associated with transferring sterilization operations for regulated products.\nAt a broader level, several states have increased the regulatory requirements associated with the use and emission of ethylene oxide, the most frequently used sterilant for medical devices and health care products in the U.S. This increased regulation could require BD or sterilization service providers, including providers used by BD, to temporarily suspend operations to install additional air quality controls, limit the use of ethylene oxide or take other actions, which would further reduce the available capacity of third-party providers to sterilize medical devices and health care products. A few states have filed lawsuits to require additional air quality controls and expand limitations on the use of ethylene oxide at sterilization facilities. In December 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a lawsuit seeking a temporary restraining order and a preliminary and permanent injunction against a major medical device sterilizer, which sterilizes certain of our surgery products, to reduce ethylene oxide emissions associated with their sterilization process. On the federal level, in late 2019, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency provided notice that it would be conducting rulemaking to reconsider federal regulations applicable to the use and emission of ethylene oxide. If any such proceedings or rulemaking result in the suspension of sterilization operations at BD or at medical device sterilizers used by BD, or otherwise limit the availability of third-party sterilization capacity, this could interrupt or otherwise adversely impact production of certain of our products. BD has business continuity plans in place to mitigate the impact of any such disruptions, although these plans may not be able to fully offset such impact, for the reasons noted above.\nFor further discussion of risks relating to the regulations to which we are subject, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n7\nHuman Capital Management\nAt BD, our associates are guided by our Purpose,\nadvancing the world of health\nand The BD WAY, our culture and values.  Each empowers our associates to contribute individuality, unique ideas, and experiences to fuel innovation and better patient outcomes. As of September 30, 2021, BD is comprised of approximately 75,000 associates located in over 62 countries. Attracting, developing and retaining talented people in technical, marketing, sales, research and other positions is crucial to executing our strategy and our ability to compete effectively in a highly competitive medical technology industry.  Our ability to recruit and retain such talent depends on several factors, including compensation and benefits, talent development and career opportunities, and our unique culture.  To that end, we continually invest in our associates in order to be an employer of choice.\nInclusion, Diversity & Equity\nWe continually engage a workforce that reflects the communities we live and work in and the customers and patients we serve, and that possesses a broad range of thought and experiences which have helped BD achieve our leadership position in the medical technology industry and the global marketplace. A key component of our journey to continually build a better BD is our commitment to global inclusion, diversity and equity (\"ID&E\"). We believe this commitment allows us to better our understanding of patient and customer needs and develop technologies to meet those needs. Our ID&E efforts have garnered recognitions, including Best Places to Work for Disability and LGBTQ Inclusion, Bloomberg’s Gender Equality Index, and Diversity Inc.’s Noteworthy Companies.\nWhile we continue to demonstrate progress in the diverse representation of our workforce, we seek to continuously improve in this area.  Each year, we establish annual corporate ID&E goals to improve hiring, development, advancement, and retention of diverse talent, and to advance our culture of inclusion.  In addition, our executive leaders serve as sponsors of our nine associate-led resource groups (\"ARGs\") who are empowered to set strategic goals that drive belonging, allyship, community service and professional development.\nExternally, we are building on our existing momentum and remain involved in industry ID&E efforts with the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed) to improve diversity in the medical technology industry. We  remain committed to support and partner with the United Nation’s Open for Business, United Negro College Fund, the Equal Justice Initiative (“EJI”) and our BD Helping Build Healthy Communities initiative. Through the BD Helping Build Healthy Communities™ initiative, we committed $22.6 million to support Direct Relief and the National Association of Community Health Centers in expanding the innovative practices of U.S. community health centers, which collectively serve more than 30 million U.S. patients, the majority of which are in underserved communities.  We also built upon our support for the EJI, taking the opportunity to engage our associates in a 21-Day Racial Equity and Social Justice Challenge to bring further awareness and understanding of social and racial justice issues. For each associate that engaged with the challenge, we committed an additional monetary donation to the EJI.\nFor the above table, we define “executives” as associates in positions of vice president and above.  “Management” positions are defined as those in manager, director or equivalent roles.  Information regarding race and gender is based on information provided by associates.\n8\nAssociate Growth and Development\nAt BD we are accountable for learning and growing every day.  Our commitment to continuous improvement helps us to become the best version of ourselves. We invest significant resources to develop talent with the right capabilities to deliver the growth and innovation needed to support our strategy. We have launched an enhanced Strategic Organizational Planning process in order to build the organizational capabilities required in the years to come.  We offer associates and their managers a number of tools to help in their personal and professional development, including career development plans, mentoring programs and in-house learning opportunities, including BD University, our in-house continuing education program that follows a \"leaders-as-teachers\" approach.  We also have a deeply-rooted practice of investing in our next generation of leaders and offer associates a number of leadership development programs, including programs dedicated to specific areas, such as finance and technology. This year we have launched several new flagship programs to help our more than 8,000 People Managers to become even more efficient as managers and in the coming years we will continue to roll-out programs that help leaders create work environments that facilitate growth and success. We have, in addition, conducted several virtual programs for our Executive Leaders to support them in their role as company leaders responsible for navigating the pandemic. We believe in and encourage in our associates and leaders a Growth Mindset, a belief that qualities and talents can be developed through dedication and hard work, and have aligned our performance management system to support our culture evolution and increased focus on continuous learning and development.\nAssociate Engagement\nAs we work to continuously make an impact on how healthcare is delivered, we believe it is critical that our associates are informed, engaged and have the opportunity to provide feedback.  We communicate frequently and transparently with our associates through a variety of communication methods, including video and written communications, town hall meetings, associate surveys and our company intranet, and acknowledge individual contributions to BD through a number of rewards and recognition award programs.  We believe these engagement efforts keep associates informed about our strategy, culture and purpose and motivated to do their best work.  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also further strengthened our digital communication and social networking platforms.  Our communications throughout the pandemic have kept our associates informed on critical priorities, important actions being taken by management in response to the pandemic, and continued efforts to protect associate health, safety and well-being.\nIn addition to helping associates stay engaged, we also work to foster and reinforce an inclusive culture where diverse perspectives are valued. This year, our ARGs hosted company-wide dialogues and panel sessions to advance our business and cultural priorities and engage associates on timely topics on racial injustice, immigration, allyship, health care inequity and access, voting rights, mental health and parent-caregiver considerations during a pandemic. We continue to engage in discussions as a company on intersectionality, inclusion and belonging.\nWe seek ongoing feedback to better understand what we are doing well and how we can improve the associate experience. In addition to encouraging a speak up culture between associates, their managers, and cross functional teams, we conduct employee engagement surveys to provide all associates with an opportunity to share their perspective and we take appropriate action in response.\nWe also have a long-standing history of associate volunteerism that we believe has had an impact on local and global communities. Through our public-private partnerships and collaborations with non-government organizations, we sponsor volunteer trips and other meaningful volunteer opportunities to help communities around the world.  On a local front, associates are encouraged and empowered to serve organizations and causes that are important to them.  This includes a matching gift program, paid time off to volunteer, and an award program to give grants to non-profit organizations in honor of associates who engage in exceptional volunteer efforts.\nCompensation, Benefits and Well-being\nWe are committed to rewarding, supporting, and developing the associates who make it possible to deliver on our strategy.  To that end, we offer a comprehensive total rewards program aimed at promoting\n9\noverall well-being in support of the varying health, home-life and financial needs of our diverse and global associates.  Our total rewards packages (which vary by location) include market-competitive pay, broad-based stock grants and bonuses, healthcare benefits, pension and retirement savings plans, paid time off and family leave, flexible work schedules, on-site health and fitness centers, free physicals and flu vaccinations, well-being education and resources, Employee Assistance Programs and other mental health support and resources. Each year we review and implement program enhancements and investments to ensure our benefits are inclusive and representative of the needs of BD associates and their families. Additionally, over the last few years in the U.S., we have increased efforts to mitigate the impact of rising healthcare costs and to offer more affordable benefit options, with a specific focus on affordability for BD associates earning $50,000 per year or less.\nBD is also committed to compensating all associates fairly and equitably for their contributions to company performance. For 2021, we conducted a pay equity assessment for associates in 57 countries to identify and remedy any potential pay disparity issues.\nAvailable Information\nBD maintains a website at www.bd.com.

    "text": "An investment in BD involves a variety of risks and uncertainties. The following describes some of the material risks that could adversely affect BD’s business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.  We may also be adversely impacted by other risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial.\nBusiness, Economic and Industry Risks\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health threats, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business. The nature and extent of future impacts are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\nWe are subject to risks associated with public health threats, including epidemics and pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic.  The outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 and the travel restrictions, quarantines and other actions taken by governments and the private sector to slow the spread of the virus resulted in a global economic slowdown, and caused healthcare systems to divert resources to manage the pandemic.  These measures led to unprecedented restrictions on and disruptions in businesses and personal activities.  As a result, we experienced significant reductions in the demand for certain of our products due to reductions in elective and non-essential procedures, lower utilization of routine testing and related specimen collection, reduced capital spend by customers and a decrease in research activity due to laboratory closures and reduced clinical testing. Any resurgences in COVID-19 infections or new strains of the virus could result in the imposition of new governmental lockdowns, quarantine requirements or other restrictions to slow the spread of the virus, or the deferral of elective medical procedures, which could weaken demand for certain of our products. These measures could include determinations that our or our suppliers’ facilities are not essential businesses that could result in closures or other restrictions that significantly disrupt our operations or those of distributors or suppliers in our supply chain.  While COVID-19 case volumes have decreased in the U.S and certain other countries, the global outlook remains uncertain as case counts fluctuate and vaccination rates remain relatively low in many parts of the world.  Going forward, medical procedure rates may vary by country based on regional COVID-19 infection and vaccination rates, hospital occupancy and staffing levels, transportation limitations, quarantines and other restrictions, and the emergence of new COVID-19 variants.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our global supply chain network, and we may experience disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components used in our products. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant challenges to our global transportation channels and other aspects of the global supply chain network, including to the cost and availability of raw materials and components due to shortages and resulting cost inflation. Any such delays or shortages may result in our inability to meet customer demand for our products and as COVID-19 conditions improve, there may be unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products, which may pose challenges to our supply chain and could adversely affect our business. While utilization rates for most of our products have largely recovered to pre-pandemic levels, future deferrals of elective medical procedures and/or the imposition of new governmental restrictions due to resurgences in COVID-19 infections or new strains of the virus may weaken demand for certain of our products and/or disrupt our operations. In addition, in response to the pandemic, we developed and launched multiple products for the detection and identification of COVID-19, including tests for our BD Max™ molecular System and BD Veritor™ Plus System, and there are a number of factors, including the rate of vaccination and the availability of competitive products, that could impact the level of demand and pricing for our COVID-19 diagnostics testing.\nAdditionally, on September 9, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order requiring all employers with U.S. Government contracts to require that their U.S.-based employees, contractors, and certain subcontractors, that work on or in support of U.S. Government contracts, are fully vaccinated as set forth in the executive order, except for any employees with a medical or religious exemption. As a U.S. Government contractor, we are required to comply with the executive order. The implementation of these requirements may result in employee attrition, which could be material as a substantial number of our manufacturing and distribution center employees are based in areas of the country where vaccination rates are below the national average. If we were to lose employees, it may be difficult or very costly in the current competitive labor market\n11\nto find and recruit replacement employees, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, on September 9, 2021, President Biden announced that he has directed The Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) to develop an Emergency Temporary Standard (“ETS”) mandating either the full vaccination or weekly testing of employees for employers with 100 or more employees. On November 4, 2021, OSHA issued the ETS, which requires employers with 100 or more employees to develop, implement and enforce a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy, unless they adopt a policy requiring employees to choose to either be vaccinated or undergo regular COVID-19 testing and wear a face covering at work. The ETS and the executive order are effective as of January 4, 2022. On November 12, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted a motion to stay OSHA’s ETS and ordered that OSHA take no further steps to implement or enforce the ETS until a further court order. Due to the pending litigation, OSHA has suspended activities related to the implementation and enforcement of the ETS pending future developments. It is currently not possible to predict with certainty the impact the executive order or OSHA’s ETS will have on our workforce.  Additional vaccine mandates may also be implemented in other jurisdictions in which we operate.\nThe scope and duration of the pandemic, including  future resurgences globally, the pace at which government restrictions are lifted or whether additional actions may be taken to contain the virus, the global vaccination rate, the speed and extent to which global markets and utilization rates for our products fully recover from the disruptions caused by the pandemic, and the impact of these factors on our business, financial condition and results of operations, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.\nTo the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our operations and global economic conditions more generally, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.\nA downturn in economic conditions could adversely affect our operations.\nDeterioration in the domestic or international economic environment, particularly in emerging markets and countries with government-sponsored healthcare systems, may cause decreased demand for our products and services and increased competition, which could result in lower sales volume and lower prices for our products, longer sales cycles, and slower adoption of new technologies. A weakening of macroeconomic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers, which could result in interruptions in supply. We have previously experienced delays in collecting government receivables in certain countries in Western Europe due to economic conditions, and we may experience similar delays in the future in these and other countries or regions experiencing financial problems.\nThe medical technology industry is very competitive.\nWe are a global company that faces significant competition from a wide range of companies. These include large medical device companies with multiple product lines, some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do, as well as firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets or product lines. Non-traditional entrants, such as technology companies, are also entering into the healthcare industry, some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. We face competition across all our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold on the basis of product features, clinical or economic outcomes, product quality, availability, price, services and other factors. Our ability to compete is also impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements, such as increased demand for more environmentally-friendly products and for products incorporating digital capabilities, as well as changes in the ways health care services are delivered (including the transition of more care from acute to non-acute settings and increased focus on chronic disease management).  Cost containment efforts by governments and the private sector are also resulting in increased emphasis on products that reduce costs, improve clinical results and expand patient access.  Our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we meet these changing market demands in terms of our product offerings and marketing approaches.\nThe medical technology industry is also subject to rapid technological change and discovery and frequent product introductions. The development of new or improved products, processes or technologies by other companies (such as needle-free injection technology) that provide better features, pricing, clinical outcomes or\n12\neconomic value may render our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. In some instances, competitors, including pharmaceutical companies, also offer, or are attempting to develop, alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device. Lower cost producers have also created pricing pressure, particularly in developing markets.\nThe medical technology industry has also experienced a significant amount of consolidation, resulting in companies with greater scale and market presence than BD. Traditional distributors are also manufacturers of medical devices, providing another source of competition.  In addition, health care systems and other providers are consolidating, resulting in greater purchasing power for these companies. As a result, competition among medical device suppliers to provide goods and services has increased.  Group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have also served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device suppliers. Further consolidation in the industry could intensify competition among medical device suppliers and exert additional pressure on the demand for and prices of our products.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risk.\nA substantial amount of our revenues are derived from international operations, and we anticipate that a significant portion of our sales will continue to come from outside the U.S. in the future. The revenues we report with respect to our operations outside the United States may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. A discussion of the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we may attempt to address any impact is contained in Item 7.  Management’s Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any hedging activities we engage in may only offset a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks.\nChanges in reimbursement practices of third-party payers or other cost containment measures could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold.\nOur sales depend, in part, on the extent to which healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities (including Medicare, Medicaid and comparable foreign programs) and private insurers for the costs of our products.  The coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third-party payers, which can vary among public and private sources and by country, may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for those products in a particular jurisdiction. Reimbursement rates can also affect the market acceptance rate of new technologies and products. Reforms to reimbursement systems in the United States or abroad, changes in coverage or reimbursement rates by private payers, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems could significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our products or result in denial of reimbursement for those products, which would adversely affect customer demand or the price customers are willing to pay for such products. See “Third-Party Reimbursement” under Item 1. Business.\nInitiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs in the U.S. and other countries where we do business may also put pressure on medical device pricing.  In the U.S., these include, among others, value-based purchasing and managed care arrangements.  Governments in China and other countries are also using various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures, including increased use of competitive bidding and tenders, and price regulation.\nOur future growth is dependent in part upon the development of new products, and there can be no assurance that such products will be developed.\nA significant element of our strategy is to increase revenue growth by focusing on innovation and new product development. New product development requires significant investment in R&D, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs, innovate and develop new products and technologies, successfully complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the United States and\n13\nabroad, manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, obtain appropriate intellectual property protection, and gain and maintain market acceptance of our products. In addition, patents attained by others can preclude or delay our commercialization of a product. There can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance.\nOur international operations subject us to certain business risks.\nA substantial amount of our sales come from our operations outside the United States, and we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in foreign markets, especially in emerging markets. Our foreign operations subject us to certain risks relating to, among other things, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange (discussed above), local political conditions, general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rate volatility and credit availability, competition from local companies, increases in trade protectionism, U.S. relations with the governments of the foreign countries in which we operate, foreign regulatory requirements or changes in such requirements, changes in local health care payment systems and health care delivery systems, local product preferences and requirements, longer payment terms for account receivables than we experience in the U.S., difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations, changes to international trade agreements and treaties, changes in tax laws, weakening or loss of the protection of intellectual property rights in some countries, and import or export licensing requirements.  The success of our operations outside the United States also depends, in part, on our ability to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to, among other things, our production facilities and sales and distribution networks.  These and other factors may adversely impact our ability to pursue our growth strategy in these markets.\nIn addition, our international operations are governed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws outside the U.S. Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased substantially in recent years, with more enforcement proceedings by U.S. and foreign governmental agencies and the imposition of significant fines and penalties. While we have implemented policies and procedures to enhance compliance with these laws, our international operations, which often involve customer relationships with foreign governments, create the risk that there may be unauthorized payments or offers of payments made by employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors. Any alleged or actual violations of these laws may subject us to government investigations and significant criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, and negatively affect our reputation.\nChanges in U.S. policy regarding international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements, could also negatively impact our business.  The U.S. has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from China and certain other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional tariffs imposed by the U.S. on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could result in an increase in supply chain costs that we may not be able to offset or that otherwise adversely impact our results of operations.\nReductions in customers’ research budgets or government funding may adversely affect our business.\nWe sell products to researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government laboratories and private foundations. Research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions. A number of these customers are also dependent for their funding upon grants from U.S. government agencies, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) and agencies in other countries. The level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable. For instance, there have been instances where NIH grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods. The availability of governmental research funding may be adversely affected by economic conditions and governmental spending reductions. Any reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products.\n14\nWe need to attract and retain key employees to be competitive.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to attract and retain executives and other key employees. Competition for experienced employees, particularly for persons with specialized skills, can be intense. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical, manufacturing and distribution experience to operate our business successfully. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including compensation and benefits, work location and work environment. From time to time there may be shortages of skilled labor, which may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified employees or lead to increased labor costs. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees, our business could be adversely affected.\nFor a further discussion of risks related to the Biden administration vaccine mandates, see the above-referenced Risk Factor, “We are subject to risks associated with public health threats, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business. The nature and extent of future impacts are highly uncertain and unpredictable.”\nOperational Risks\nBreaches of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe rely on information systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations, including sensitive personal or proprietary information. In addition, some of our products include information systems that collect data regarding patients and patient therapy on behalf of our customers and some connect to our systems for maintenance purposes.  Our information systems have been subjected to attack via malicious code execution, and cyber- or phishing- attacks, and we have experienced instances of unauthorized access to our systems in the past and expect to be subject to similar cyberattacks in the future. In addition to our own information, in the course of doing business, we sometimes store information with third parties that could be subject to attacks.\nCyberattacks could result in our intellectual property and other confidential information being accessed, destroyed or stolen, which could adversely affect our competitive position in the market.  Likewise, we could suffer disruption of our operations and other significant negative consequences, including increased costs for security measures or remediation, diversion of management attention, litigation and damage to our relationships with vendors, business partners and customers.  Unauthorized tampering, adulteration or interference with our products may also create issues with product functionality that could result in a loss of data, risk to patient safety, and product recalls or field actions.  Cyberattacks could result in unauthorized access to our systems and products, which could also impact our compliance with privacy and other laws and regulations and could result in actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation.  While we will continue to dedicate significant resources to protect against unauthorized access to our systems and products, and work with government authorities and third-party providers to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents, cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated, frequent and adaptive. There can be no assurances that these protective measures will prevent future attacks that could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nCost volatility could adversely affect our operations\n.\nOur results of operations could be negatively impacted by volatility in the cost of raw materials, components, freight and energy that, in turn, increases the costs of producing and distributing our products. New laws or regulations adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy and transportation costs, as well as the costs of certain raw materials and components. In particular, we purchase supplies of resins, which are oil-based components used in the manufacture of certain products, and any significant increases in resin costs could adversely impact future operating results. Increases in oil prices can also increase our packaging and transportation costs. Recently, the costs of raw materials, transportation, construction, services, and energy necessary for the production and distribution of our products have increased significantly. While we have implemented cost containment measures, selective price increases and taken other actions to offset these inflationary pressures in our supply chain, we may not be able to completely offset all the increases in our operational costs.\n15\nA reduction or interruption in the supply of certain raw materials and components could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe purchase many different types of raw materials and components used in our products. Certain raw materials and components are not available from multiple sources. In addition, for quality assurance, cost-effectiveness and other reasons, certain raw materials and components are purchased from sole suppliers. The price and supply of these materials and components may be impacted or disrupted for reasons beyond our control including supplier shutdowns, transportation delays, inflationary pricing pressures, work stoppages, labor shortages and governmental regulatory actions. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant challenges to our global transportation channels and other aspects of the global supply chain network, including to the cost and availability of raw materials and components due to shortages and resulting cost inflation. The U.S. and other governments may enact or use laws and regulations, such as the Defense Production Act or export restrictions, to ensure availability of needed COVID-19 testing and vaccination delivery devices. Any such action may impact our global supply chain network. While we work with suppliers to ensure continuity of supply and service, no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful. In addition, due to regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis or without excessive cost. The termination, reduction or interruption in supply of these raw materials and components could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterruption of our manufacturing or sterilization operations could adversely affect our business.\nWe have manufacturing sites all over the world. In some instances, however, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants. Interruption to our manufacturing operations resulting from weather or natural disasters, regulatory requirements or issues in our manufacturing process, equipment failure or other factors, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products.  In some instances, we may not be able to transition manufacturing to other BD sites or a third party to replace the lost production.  A significant interruption of our manufacturing operations could result in lost revenues and damage to our relationships with customers.\nIn addition, many of our products require sterilization prior to sale, and we utilize both BD facilities and third-parties for this process.  In some instances, only a few facilities are qualified under applicable regulations to conduct this sterilization.  To the extent we or third-parties are unable to sterilize our products, whether due to lack of capacity, regulatory requirements or otherwise, we may be unable to transition sterilization to other sites or modalities in a timely or cost effective manner, or at all, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nAt a broader level, several states have increased the regulatory requirements associated with the use and emission of ethylene oxide for sterilization. This increased regulation could require BD or sterilization service providers, including providers used by BD, to temporarily suspend operations, limit the use of ethylene oxide or take other actions, which would further reduce the available capacity of third-party providers to sterilize medical devices and health care products. Federal agencies may also regulate the use and emission of ethylene oxide. If any such regulatory actions or rulemaking result in the suspension of sterilization operations at BD or at medical device sterilizers used by BD, or otherwise limit the availability of third-party sterilization capacity, this could interrupt or otherwise adversely impact production of certain of our products. See “Item 1. Business - Regulation” for a discussion of the consent order BD entered into with the Environmental Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.\nOur business and operations are subject to risks related to climate change.\nThe long-term effects of global climate change present risks to our business.  Extreme weather or other conditions caused by climate change could adversely impact our supply chain and the availability and cost of raw materials and components required for the operation of our business.  Such conditions could also result in physical damage to products, plants and distribution centers, as well as the infrastructure and facilities of\n16\nhospitals, medical care facilities and other customers.  In addition, regulations intended to limit greenhouse gas emissions, such as taxes on fuel and energy, to mitigate the impacts of climate change may increase, which could increase our operating costs and the costs charged by suppliers.  These events could adversely affect our operations and our financial performance.\nLegal, Quality and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to lawsuits.\nWe are or have been a defendant in a number of lawsuits, including, among others, purported class action lawsuits for alleged antitrust violations and violations of federal securities laws, product liability claims (which may involve lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation proceedings, including pending claims relating to our hernia repair implant products, surgical continence and pelvic organ prolapse products for women and vena cava filter products), and suits alleging patent infringement. We have also been subject to government subpoenas and civil investigative demands seeking information with respect to alleged violations of law, including in connection with federal and/or state healthcare programs (such as Medicare or Medicaid), federal contracting requirements and/or sales and marketing practices. A more detailed description of certain litigation to which we are a party is contained in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We could be subject to additional lawsuits, governmental investigations, subpoenas and civil investigative demands in the future. Any such lawsuits, governmental investigations, subpoenas and civil investigative demands could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could distract management from the operations of the business.\nReserves established for estimated losses with respect to legal proceedings do not represent an exact calculation of our actual liability, but instead represent our estimate of the probable loss at the time the reserve is established. Due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and our underlying loss reserve estimates, additional reserves may be established or current reserves may be significantly increased from time-to-time. Also, in some instances, we are not able to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur charges materially in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, excess liability insurance. Any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nWith respect to certain litigation, we believe that some settlements and judgments, as well as legal defense costs, may be covered in whole or in part under applicable insurance policies with a limited number of insurance companies, or, in some circumstances, indemnification obligations owed to us by other parties. However, amounts recovered under these arrangements may be less than the stated coverage limits or less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers or other parties will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will be otherwise available. Also, for certain product liability claims or lawsuits, BD does not maintain or has limited remaining insurance coverage, and we may not be able to obtain additional insurance on acceptable terms or at all that will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation.\nOur operations are global and are affected by complex state, federal and international laws relating to healthcare, environmental protection, antitrust, anti-corruption, marketing, fraud and abuse (including anti-kickback and false claims laws), export control, product safety and efficacy, employment, privacy and other areas. Violations of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines and, in some cases, exclusion from participation in health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Environmental laws, particularly with respect to climate change and the emission of greenhouse gases, are also becoming more stringent throughout the world, which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate closures of or changes to our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers, or result in liability to BD. The enactment of\n17\nadditional laws in the future may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations and financial performance.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Most of our products must receive clearance or approval from the FDA or counterpart regulatory agencies in other countries before they can be marketed or sold. The process for obtaining marketing approval or clearance may require us to incur significant costs in terms of time and resources, and these costs have been increasing due to increased requirements from the FDA and comparable governing bodies for supporting data for submissions. The regulatory process may also require changes to our products or result in limitations on the indicated uses of our products. Governmental agencies may also impose new requirements regarding registration, including, but not limited to, labeling or prohibited materials that require us to modify or re-register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries.\nFollowing the introduction of a product, these agencies also periodically review our manufacturing processes and product performance. Our failure to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practices, adverse event reporting, and other post market requirements of these agencies could delay or prevent the production, marketing or sale of our products and result in delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, warning letters or consent decrees, closure of manufacturing sites, import bans, seizures or recalls of products, civil or criminal sanctions and damage to our reputation. More stringent oversight by the FDA and other agencies in recent years has resulted in increased enforcement activity, which increases our compliance risk.\nWe are operating under a consent decree with the FDA, entered into by CareFusion in 2007 and amended in 2009, that affects our Alaris™ infusion pump business in the United States. We are also currently operating under a warning letter issued by the FDA. For more information regarding the consent decree and warning letter, see “Regulation” under Item 1. Business.\nAs previously disclosed, we are undertaking certain remediation of our BD Alaris System, and are currently shipping the product in the U.S., only in cases of medical necessity and to remediate recalled software versions.  We will not be able to fully resume commercial operations for the BD Alaris System in the U.S. until a 510(k) submission relating to the product has been cleared by the FDA.  No assurance can be given as to when or if clearance will be obtained from the FDA.\nIn addition, the European Union (“EU”) has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (the “EU MDR”) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the “EU IVDR”), each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evidence requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. Effective May 2021, manufacturers of currently approved medical devices must meet the requirements of the EU MDR for self-certified devices and have until May 2024 to meet the requirements for medical devices with a valid conformity assessment certificate.  Manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic medical devices have until May 2022 to meet the EU IVDR. Complying with and maintaining devices under these regulations requires us to incur significant expenditures. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to EU conformity requirements.\nWe are also subject to complex and frequently changing privacy and data protection laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. as well as in all other regions where BD operates, regarding the collection, use, storage, transfer and other processing of personal information. Any actual or perceived noncompliance with these laws, rules and regulations could result in significant consequences for BD, including, among other things, business interruption, sanctions and significant pecuniary fines, regulatory inquiries and investigations, adverse publicity, loss of competitive advantage and customer trust, as well as privacy litigation and civil lawsuits with damages.\nThe importance of privacy laws, rules and regulations for the healthcare and med-tech industry is constantly growing, since personal data has become an integral part of doing business in our sector, and the legal climate, norms around data sharing, and the definition of meaningful privacy are evolving and becoming more complex worldwide.\nFor instance, the European General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), applicable as of 2018 and still one of the strictest and most comprehensive privacy laws in the world, is being continuously enforced,\n18\nand increasingly heavy fines are now being levied on businesses. Fines for noncompliance with the GDPR can amount to up to €20 million or 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover from the preceding financial year (whichever is higher) and may be imposed in conjunction with the exercise of the authority’s investigatory and corrective powers. The GDPR’s extraterritorial scope makes it applicable to our U.S.-based legal entities whenever our business activities, systems and products process the personal data of EU residents.\nPrivacy laws, rules and regulations are also rapidly developing in other regions. Several states in the U.S. have introduced dedicated privacy laws (e.g., California and Virginia) or have draft privacy laws in the pipeline, and new privacy and data protection laws have come into effect in relevant countries like China, Brazil, India and South Korea. These laws impact BD businesses to the extent they rely on the use of personal data and pose the challenge of how to cope with a heterogeneous patchwork of laws, rules, regulations and industry standards while maintaining our global reach.\nDefects or quality issues associated with our products could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, component failures, unapproved or improper use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other serious adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or as required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. A recall could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers, enforcement actions and/or investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of post-market approval requirements.\nOur operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets.\nMany of our businesses rely on patent, trademark and other intellectual property assets. These intellectual property assets, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. We can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations, legal challenges or governmental action. Patents attained by competitors, particularly as patents on our products expire, may also adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, competitors may seek to invalidate patents on our products or claim that our products infringe upon their intellectual property, which could result in a loss of competitive advantage or the payment of significant legal fees, damage awards and past or future royalties, as well as injunctions against future sales of our products. We also operate in countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the U.S., which could make it easier for competitors to compete with us in those countries. The loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings, financial condition or cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe may not be able to service all of our indebtedness.\nWe depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments. However, our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations of the combined Company and to utilize other methods to make scheduled payments will depend on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. There can be no assurance that these sources will be adequate. If we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, we will be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek additional capital, sell assets or refinance our indebtedness. Any such action may not be successful and we may be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n19\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness impose restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our businesses.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, have liens on our property, and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person, engage in certain transactions with affiliates and change the nature of our business. In addition, the agreements also require us to comply with certain financial covenants, including financial ratios. Our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations.\nRisks Relating to the Proposed Spin-off of the Diabetes Care Business\nRisks relating to proposed spin-off.\nOn May 6, 2021, we announced our intention to spin off our Diabetes Care business as a separate publicly traded company to BD’s shareholders. The proposed spin-off is intended to be a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is expected to be completed in the first half of calendar year 2022, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including final approval by BD’s Board of Directors and the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form 10 filed with the SEC.\nExecuting the proposed spin-off will require significant time and attention from BD’s senior management and employees, which could disrupt BD’s ongoing business and adversely affect financial results and results of operations. The proposed spin-off is also complex, and completion of the proposed spin-off and the timing of its completion will be subject to a number of factors and conditions, including the readiness of the new company to operate as an independent public company and finalization of the capital structure of the new company. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the proposed spin-off, including, but not limited to, disruptions in general or financial market conditions, material adverse changes in business or industry conditions, unanticipated costs and potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory and tax approvals or clearances. There can be no assurances that BD will be able to complete the proposed spin-off on the terms or on the timeline that was announced, if at all. In addition, if the spin-off is completed, the Company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from the spin-off. Further, there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of BD’s common stock would have been had the proposed spin-off not occurred.\nGeneral Business Risks\nWe cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances will be successful.\nWe seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. Such transactions are inherently risky, and the integration of any newly-acquired business requires significant effort and management attention. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business. There can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful.\nNatural disasters, war and other events could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income.\nNatural disasters, including the impacts of climate change, hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, fires, earthquakes and floods and other extreme weather events, global health pandemics, war, terrorism, labor\n20\ndisruptions and international conflicts, and actions taken by the United States and other governments or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events, could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the United States and areas outside of the United States in which we operate. These events could result in decreased demand for our products, adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities, or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers."

Within the tables presented throughout this discussion, certain columns may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts. References to years throughout this discussion relate to our fiscal years, which end on September 30.\nCompany Overview\nDescription of the Company and Business Segments\nBecton, Dickinson and Company (“BD”) is a global medical technology company engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products used by healthcare institutions, physicians, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, the pharmaceutical industry and the general public. The Company's organizational structure is based upon three principal business segments, BD Medical (“Medical”), BD Life Sciences (“Life Sciences”) and BD Interventional (“Interventional”).\nBD’s products are manufactured and sold worldwide. Our products are marketed in the United States and internationally through independent distribution channels and directly to end-users by BD and independent sales representatives. We organize our operations outside the United States as follows: EMEA (which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa); Greater Asia (which includes countries in Greater China, Japan, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Korea, Australia and New Zealand); Latin America (which includes Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America); and Canada. We continue to pursue growth opportunities in emerging markets, which include the following geographic regions: Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and certain countries within Greater Asia. We are primarily focused on certain countries whose healthcare systems are expanding.\nStrategic Objectives\nBD remains focused on delivering durable growth and creating shareholder value, while making appropriate investments for the future. BD 2025, our vehicle for value creation, is anchored in three key pillars: grow, simplify and empower. BD's management team aligns our operating model and investments with these key strategic pillars through continuous focus on the following underlying objectives:\nGrow\n•\nDeveloping and maintaining a strong portfolio of leading products and solutions that address significant unmet clinical needs, improve outcomes, and reduce costs;\n•\nFocusing on our core products, services and solutions that deliver greater benefits to patients, healthcare workers and researchers;\n•\nInvesting in research and development that leads to and expands category leadership, as well as results in a robust product pipeline;\n•\nLeveraging our global scale to expand our reach in providing access to affordable medical technologies around the world, including emerging markets;\n•\nSupplementing our internal growth through strategic acquisitions in faster growing market segments;\n•\nDriving an efficient capital structure and strong shareholder returns.\nSimplify\n•\nDriving operating effectiveness and margin expansion by placing controls on sourcing and transportation costs, as well as by increasing labor productivity and asset efficiencies;\n•\nFocusing on cash management in order to improve balance sheet productivity;\n•\nWorking across our supply chain to reduce environmental impacts;\n24\n•\nCreating more resilient operations based on an enterprise-wide renewable energy strategy;\n•\nReducing complexity across our manufacturing network and rationalizing our product portfolio to optimize architecture, portfolio and business processes;\n•\nEnhancing our quality and risk management systems;\n•\nSimplifying our internal business processes.\nEmpower\n•\nFostering a purpose-driven culture with a focus on positive impact to all stakeholders–customers, patients, employees and communities;\n•\nImproving our ability to serve customers and enhance customer experiences through the digitalization of internal processes and go-to-market approaches;\n•\nCultivating an inclusive work environment that welcomes and celebrates diverse talent and perspectives.\nIn assessing the outcomes of these strategies as well as BD’s financial condition and operating performance, management generally reviews forecast data, monthly actual results, including segment sales, and other similar information. We also consider trends related to certain key financial data, including gross profit margin, selling and administrative expense, investment in research and development, return on invested capital, and cash flows.\nBD’s Intention to Spin Off Diabetes Care\nOn May 6, 2021, we announced our intention to spin off our Diabetes Care business as a separate publicly traded company to BD’s shareholders. The proposed spin-off is intended to be a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is expected to be completed in the first half of calendar year 2022, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including final approval from BD’s Board of Directors and the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form 10. The Company believes that as an independent, publicly traded entity, the Diabetes Care business will be positioned to more effectively allocate its capital and operational resources with a dedicated growth strategy.  For further discussion of risks relating to the proposed spin-off of our Diabetes Care business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Proposed Spin-off of the Diabetes Care Business.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Impacts and Response\nA novel strain of coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization  in March 2020 and governments around the world have been implementing various measures to slow and control the ongoing spread of COVID-19. These government measures, as well as a shift in healthcare priorities, resulted in a significant decline in medical procedures in our fiscal year 2020.  Demand for our products showed substantial recovery in our fiscal year 2021; however, regional resurgences in COVID-19 infections and the emergence of the Delta variant continued to impact the demand for certain of our products in our fiscal year 2021.  Our 2021 revenues reflected a substantial benefit from sales related to COVID-19 diagnostic testing on the BD Veritor\nTM\nPlus and BD Max\nTM\nSystems. The factors that affected our revenue growth in fiscal year 2021, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, are discussed in greater detail further below.\nDue to the significant uncertainty that exists relative to the duration and overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our future operating performance, particularly in the short-term, may be subject to volatility.  While non-acute utilization rates for most of our products have largely recovered to pre-pandemic levels, resurgences in COVID-19 infections or new strains of the virus may weaken future demand for certain of our products and/or disrupt our operations. We also continue to see challenges posed by the pandemic to global transportation channels and other aspects of our supply chain, including the cost and availability of raw materials, as well as logistical challenges affecting the movement of freight around the globe. The United States and other governments may enact or use laws and regulations, such as the Defense Production Act or export restrictions, to ensure availability of needed COVID-19 testing and vaccination delivery devices. Any such action may impact our global supply chain network.\n25\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows is dependent on certain factors including:\n•\nThe extent to which resurgences in COVID-19 infections or new strains of the virus, including the Delta variant, result in future deferrals of elective medical procedures and/or the extent to which the imposition of new governmental lockdowns, quarantine requirements or other restrictions may weaken demand for certain of our products and/or disrupt our operations;\n•\nThe degree to which demand and pricing for our COVID-19 diagnostics testing solutions continues to be impacted by reduced infection rates, as well as by distribution and utilization of available COVID-19 vaccines and the availability of competitive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing products, which we expect will result in lower COVID-19 testing revenues in future periods;\n•\nThe degree to which the pandemic has escalated challenges that existed for global healthcare systems prior to the pandemic, such as staffing shortages, including nursing shortages, and budget constraints;\n•\nThe continued momentum of the global economy’s recovery from the pandemic and the degree of pressure that a weakened macroeconomic environment would put on future healthcare utilization and the global demand for our products.\nWe remain focused on partnering with governments, healthcare systems, and healthcare professionals to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. This focus includes providing access to our SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics tests and injection devices for global vaccination campaigns, as well as supplying products and solutions for ongoing care for patients around the world. We have also remained focused on protecting the health and safety of BD employees while ensuring continued availability of BD’s critical medical devices and technologies during these unprecedented times.\nSummary of Financial Results\nWorldwide revenues in 2021 of $20.248 billion increased 18.3% from the prior-year period, which primarily reflected an increase in volume, including increases attributable to our core products, of approximately 15.3%. Revenues in 2021 also reflected a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of approximately 2.7%, as well as a favorable impact from price of approximately 0.3%.\nVolume in 2021 reflected increased demand for our broad portfolio of products and was driven by the following:\n•\nThe Medical segment’s revenues in 2021 reflected increased demand in the Medication Delivery Solutions, Pharmaceutical Systems and Diabetes Care units, which was partially offset by a decline in the Medication Management Solutions unit.\n•\nThe Life Sciences segment’s revenues in 2021 reflected growth in both units. Growth in the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit included approximately $2 billion of revenues driven by COVID-19 diagnostic testing primarily on the BD Veritor\nTM\nPlus and BD Max\nTM\nSystems.\n•\nInterventional segment revenues in 2021 reflected increased demand in all three units as hospital utilization increased and new product offerings drove higher sales.\nWe continue to invest in research and development, geographic expansion, and new product programs to drive further revenue and profit growth. We have reinvested over $200 million of the profits from our sales related to COVID-19 diagnostic testing into our BD 2025 strategy. Our ability to sustain our long-term growth will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to expand our core business (including geographical expansion), develop innovative new products, and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness. As discussed above, current global economic conditions remain relatively volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, an inability to increase or maintain selling prices globally could adversely impact our businesses. Also, we are experiencing challenges related to global transportation channels and supply chains. These challenges have subjected certain of our costs, specifically raw material and freight costs, to inflationary pressures which have unfavorably impacted our gross profit and operating margins. Additional\n26\ndiscussion regarding the impacts of these inflationary pressures on our operating results in 2021 is provided further below.\nOur financial position remains strong, with cash flows from operating activities totaling $4.647 billion in 2021. At September 30, 2021, we had $2.403 billion in cash and equivalents and short-term investments, including restricted cash.  We continued to return value to our shareholders in the form of dividends. During fiscal year 2021, we paid cash dividends of $1.048 billion, including $958 million paid to common shareholders and $90 million paid to preferred shareholders. We also repurchased approximately $1.750 billion of our common stock during fiscal year 2021.\nEach reporting period, we face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning of such period. A weaker U.S. dollar, compared to the prior-year period, resulted in a favorable foreign currency translation impact to our revenues and an unfavorable impact to our expenses during 2021. We evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currency-neutral basis, which excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a foreign currency-neutral basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors’ ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Foreign currency-neutral (\"FXN\") information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a foreign currency-neutral basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. We calculate foreign currency-neutral percentages by converting our current-period local currency financial results using the prior-period foreign currency exchange rates and comparing these adjusted amounts to our current-period results. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Results on a foreign currency-neutral basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nResults of Operations\nMedical Segment\nThe following summarizes Medical revenues by organizational unit:\nThe Medical segment’s revenue growth in 2021 was aided by a favorable comparison to 2020, which was impacted by COVID-19 pandemic-related declines, particularly in the United States and China. These prior-year pandemic-related declines impacted our Medication Delivery Solutions unit, and to a lesser extent, the\nDiabetes Care unit. Fiscal year 2021 revenue growth in the Medication Delivery Solutions unit reflected strong demand for our core offerings, including U.S. demand for catheters and vascular care products, as well as strong global demand for syringes resulting from COVID-19 vaccination efforts. In the Medication Management\n27\nSolutions unit, lower revenues in 2021 reflected an unfavorable comparison to 2020, which benefited from global pandemic-related infusion pump orders. Growth in the Diabetes Care unit benefited from the timing of sales, slightly better than expected market demand and a favorable comparison to 2020, which was impacted by pandemic-related declines. The Pharmaceutical Systems unit’s revenue growth in 2021 reflected continued strong growth that is being driven by demand for our pre-filled devices and is enabled by capacity expansion efforts.  Demand for pre-filled devices is being aided by the vial to pre-filled device conversion for biologics, vaccines, and other injectable drugs.\nAs previously disclosed, we submitted our 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA for the BD Alaris™ System in April 2021. The 510(k) submission is intended to bring the regulatory clearance for the BD Alaris™ System up-to-date, implement new features to address the open recall issues and provide other updates, including a new version of the BD Alaris™ System software that will provide clinical, operational and cybersecurity updates. We are currently shipping the BD Alaris™ System in the United States, only in cases of medical necessity and to remediate recalled software versions.  We will not be able to fully resume commercial operations for the BD Alaris System™ in the United States until a 510(k) submission relating to the product has been cleared by the FDA. No assurances can be given as to when or if clearance will be obtained from the FDA.\nThe Medication Delivery Solutions unit's revenues in 2020 reflected an unfavorable impact relating to the COVID-19 pandemic due to a decline in healthcare utilization, particularly in the United States, China and Europe. As expected, the Medication Delivery Solutions unit's 2020 revenues in China were also unfavorably impacted by a volume-based procurement process which was adopted by several of China's provinces. The Medication Management Solutions unit's revenues in 2020 reflected a hold on U.S. shipments of BD Alaris\nTM\ninfusion pumps pending compliance with certain 510(k) filing requirements of the FDA. This unfavorable impact was partially offset by international sales of infusion pumps and pandemic-related infusion pump orders placed in the United States with medical necessity certification. Fiscal year 2020 revenues in the Diabetes Care unit were unfavorably impacted by pandemic-related declines in demand and pricing pressures in the United States. The Pharmaceutical Systems unit’s revenues in 2020 reflected continued strength in demand for prefillable products.\nMedical segment operating income was as follows:\nAs discussed in greater detail below, the Medical segment's operating income in 2021 was driven by higher gross profit margin.  Operating income in 2020 was driven by a decline in gross profit margin.\n•\nThe Medical segment’s higher gross profit margin in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily reflected the following:\n◦\nA favorable comparison to 2020, which was unfavorably impacted by increased levels of manufacturing overhead costs that were recognized in the period because of the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than capitalized within inventory, and $244 million of net charges recorded in 2020, compared with charges of $56 million in 2021, for estimated future costs within the Medication Management Solutions unit associated with remediation efforts related to Alaris\nTM\ninfusion pumps;\n◦\nLower manufacturing costs resulting from continuous improvement projects which enhanced the efficiency of our operations;\n28\n◦\nThe unfavorable impacts from foreign currency translation, investments in simplification and other cost saving initiatives, higher raw material and freight costs, as well as product quality remediation expenses.\n•\nThe Medical segment's lower gross profit margin in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily reflected the following:\n◦\nNet charges of $244 million recorded for remediation efforts related to Alaris\nTM\ninfusion pumps, as noted above;\n◦\nUnfavorable product mix and the increased levels of manufacturing overhead costs that were recognized in the period because of the COVID-19 pandemic and unfavorable product mix driven by the decline of sales in China due to the volume-based procurement process noted above;\n◦\nCharges of $41 million recorded to write down the carrying value of certain fixed assets, primarily within the Medication Delivery Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems units;\n◦\nThe favorable impact of lower manufacturing costs resulting from continuous improvement projects which enhanced the efficiency of our operations.\n•\nSelling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2021 was flat compared with 2020, primarily due to the increase in revenues in 2021, partially offset by higher travel and other administrative costs compared with 2020, which benefited from cost containment measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2020 was slightly lower compared with 2019 primarily due to lower expenses resulting from cost containment measures.\n•\nResearch and development expense as a percentage of revenues was higher in 2021 compared with 2020 which primarily reflects our commitment to research and development through continued reinvestment into our growth initiatives.  Research and development expense as a percentage of revenues was higher in 2020 compared with 2019 which reflected the decline in revenues in 2020, as well as our continued commitment to drive innovation with new products and platforms.\n•\nThe Medical segment's income in 2019 additionally reflected the estimated cumulative costs of a product recall of $75 million recorded within\nOther operating expense, net\n.  The recall related to a product component, which generally pre-dated our acquisition of CareFusion in fiscal year 2015, within the Medication Management Solutions unit's infusion systems platform.\nLife Sciences Segment\nThe following summarizes Life Sciences revenues by organizational unit:\nThe Life Sciences segment's revenue growth in 2021 primarily reflected a favorable comparison to 2020, which was significantly impacted by pandemic-related declines in both units. Revenue growth in the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit was also driven by sales related to COVID-19 diagnostic testing on the BD Veritor\nTM\n29\nPlus and BD Max\nTM\nSystems. Routine diagnostic testing levels in the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit continued to improve over the course of 2021 and the unit benefited from high demand for our specimen management portfolio, automated blood cultures and ID/AST testing solutions. The Biosciences unit's revenue growth in 2021 benefited from strong demand for instruments and reagents as lab utilization returned to normal levels.\nThe Life Sciences segment's revenues in 2020 were driven by the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit's sales, specifically in the fourth quarter, related to COVID-19 diagnostic testing on the BD Veritor\nTM\nPlus and BD Max\nTM\nSystems.  This growth in the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit was partially offset by pandemic-related declines in routine diagnostic testing and specimen collections. The Biosciences unit's revenues in 2020 reflected a decline in demand for instruments and reagents as routine research and clinical lab activity slowed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLife Sciences segment operating income was as follows:\nAs discussed in greater detail below, the Life Sciences segment's operating income in 2021 reflected improved gross profit margin and operating expense performance. Operating income in 2020 reflected improved operating expense performance, partially offset by a decline in gross profit margin.\n•\nThe Life Sciences segment’s higher gross profit margin in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily reflected the following:\n◦\nA favorable impact on product mix from the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit's sales related to COVID-19 testing and the recovery of demand for other products with higher margins;\n◦\nA favorable comparison to the prior-year period which was unfavorably impacted by increased levels of manufacturing overhead costs that were recognized in the period because of the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than capitalized within inventory;\n◦\nThe unfavorable impacts of foreign currency translation and the recognition of approximately $93 million of excess and obsolete inventory expenses related to COVID-19 testing inventory.\n•\nThe Life Sciences segment’s lower gross profit margin in fiscal year 2020 compared with 2019 primarily reflected the following:\n◦\nUnfavorable product mix and the increased levels of manufacturing overhead costs that were recognized in the period because of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n◦\nA charge of $39 million recorded in 2020 to write down the carrying value of certain intangible assets in the Biosciences unit and charges of $17 million recorded in 2020 to write down fixed assets in the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit;\n◦\nThe favorable impact on product mix from the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit's sales related to COVID-19 testing.\n•\nSelling and administrative expense as a percentage of Life Sciences revenues in 2021 was lower compared with the 2020 primarily due to the increase in revenues in 2021, partially offset by higher travel and other administrative costs compared with 2020, which benefited from cost containment measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as higher shipping costs and selling costs in 2021 associated with COVID-19 testing solutions. Selling and administrative expense as a\n30\npercentage of Life Sciences revenues in 2020 was lower compared to 2019 primarily due to the increase in revenues that was attributable to COVID-19 testing.  Lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2020 was also driven by cost containment measures and synergies realized from the combination, effective on October 1, 2019, of the former Preanalytical Systems and Diagnostic Systems units to create the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit.\n•\nResearch and development expense as a percentage of revenues in 2021 was lower compared with 2020, primarily due to the increase in revenues in 2021, partially offset by additional investments in COVID-19 testing solutions. Research and development expense as a percentage of revenues in 2020 was flat compared with 2019 as the increase in revenues that was attributable to COVID-19 testing was largely offset by investments in COVID-19 testing solutions.\nInterventional Segment\nThe following summarizes Interventional revenues by organizational unit:\nThe Interventional segment's revenues in 2021 reflected a favorable comparison to 2020, which was significantly impacted by pandemic-related declines in our Surgery and Peripheral Intervention units. Fiscal year 2021 revenue growth in the Interventional segment was also driven by stronger market demand for the Surgery unit’s infection prevention platform and the Peripheral Intervention unit's oncology products.  Revenues in the Peripheral Intervention unit additionally benefited from sales attributable to its acquisition of Straub Medical AG, which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020.  Fiscal year 2021 revenue growth in our Surgery and Peripheral Intervention units was unfavorably impacted by regional resurgences in COVID-19 infections and the emergence of the Delta variant. The Urology and Critical Care unit’s growth in 2021 showed strong demand for acute urology products and the unit's targeted temperature management portfolio.\nThe Interventional segment's revenues in 2020, particularly within the Surgery and Peripheral Intervention units, were negatively impacted by decreased demand associated with the deferral of elective medical procedures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic-related revenue declines in the Urology and Critical Care unit were offset by demand for the unit's home care and targeted temperature management businesses, and PureWick\nTM\nsystem.\nInterventional segment operating income was as follows:\n31\nAs discussed in greater detail below, the Interventional segment's operating income in 2021 was primarily driven by improved gross profit margin.  Operating income in 2020 was driven by a decline in gross profit margin.\n•\nThe Interventional segment’s higher gross profit margin in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily reflected the following:\n◦\nThe recovery of demand for products with higher margins;\n◦\nA favorable comparison to the prior-year period which was unfavorably impacted by increased levels of manufacturing overhead costs that were recognized in the period because of the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than capitalized within inventory.\n•\nThe Interventional segment’s lower gross profit margin in fiscal year 2020 compared with 2019 primarily reflected unfavorable product mix and the increased levels of manufacturing overhead costs that were recognized in the period because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n•\nSelling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2021 was lower compared with 2020 primarily due the recovery of segment revenues. Selling and administrative expense in 2020 was lower compared with 2019 primarily due to lower expenses resulting from cost containment measures.\n•\nResearch and development expense as a percentage of revenues was higher in 2021 compared with 2020 which primarily reflects reinvestment into our growth initiatives. Lower research and development expense as a percentage of revenues in 2020 as compared with 2019 primarily reflected the prior-period impact of a $30 million write-down recorded by the Surgery unit.\n•\nThe Interventional segment's lower income in 2020 additionally reflected the expiration in 2019 of a royalty income stream acquired in the Bard transaction.\nGeographic Revenues\nBD’s worldwide revenues by geography were as follows:\nU.S. revenue growth in 2021 was primarily driven by sales related to COVID-19 diagnostic testing in the Life Sciences segment's Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit, as noted above.  Strong fiscal year 2021 U.S. revenue growth in the Medical segment’s Medication Delivery Solutions unit and the Interventional segment’s Surgery and Peripheral Intervention units reflected favorable comparisons to prior-year period results, which were impacted by COVID-19 pandemic-related declines, as well as growth attributable to core products.  U.S. revenue growth in 2021 also reflected strong demand in the Interventional segment’s Urology and Critical Care unit.\nU.S. revenues in 2020 were relatively flat compared with 2019 as the Life Sciences segment's Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit's sales related to COVID-19 diagnostic testing largely offset the declines noted above for the Medical segment's Medication Management Solutions and Medication Delivery Solutions units, as well as for the Interventional segment's Surgery and Peripheral Intervention units.\nInternational revenue growth in 2021 was largely driven by COVID-19 diagnostic testing-related sales in the Life Sciences segment's Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit, as discussed further above, and by demand in the Medical segment’s Pharmaceutical Systems unit. Fiscal year 2021 international revenue growth was also\n32\ndriven by results in the Medical segment’s Medication Delivery Solutions and the Interventional segment’s Peripheral Intervention unit due to favorable comparisons to prior-year period results, which were impacted by COVID-19 pandemic-related declines, and growth attributable to core products. Fiscal year 2021 international revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by a decline in the Medical segment’s Medication Management Solutions unit, as further discussed above.\nInternational revenues in 2020 were favorably impacted by sales in the Medical segment's Pharmaceutical Systems and Medication Management Solutions units as well as by sales in the Life Sciences segment's Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit, as discussed further above.  International revenues in 2020 were unfavorably impacted by revenue declines in China and Europe for the Medical segment's Medication Delivery Solutions unit, as previously discussed.\nEmerging market revenues were as follows:\nRevenues in emerging markets in 2021 benefited from a favorable comparison to 2020 which was impacted by COVID-19 pandemic-related declines.  Revenues in emerging markets in 2020 were unfavorably impacted by a decline in healthcare utilization as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  As previously discussed above, fiscal year 2020 revenues in our Medication Delivery Solutions unit were also unfavorably impacted by a volume-based procurement process which was adopted by several of China's provinces. To date, the impact of these procurement initiatives to our revenues in China has been limited to our Medication Delivery Solutions unit.\nSpecified Items\nReflected in the financial results for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were the following specified items:\n(a)\nRepresents integration and restructuring costs recorded in\nAcquisitions and other restructurings\n, which are further discussed below.\n(b)\nRepresents costs recorded to\nOther operating expense, net\nwhich were incurred for consulting, legal, tax and other advisory services associated with the planned spin-off of BD's Diabetes Care business.\n33\n(c)\nIncludes amortization and other adjustments related to the purchase accounting for acquisitions impacting identified intangible assets and valuation of fixed assets and debt. BD’s amortization expense is primarily recorded in\nCost of products sold\n.\n(d)\nIncludes amounts recorded to\nOther operating expense, net\nwhich are detailed further below.  The amounts in 2021 and 2020 also included net charges related to the estimate of probable future product remediation costs, as further discussed below. Such amounts are recorded within\nCost of products sold\n, or in some cases, within\nOther (expense) income, net\n.\n(e)\nThe amount in 2021 reflected unrealized gains recorded within\nOther (expense) income, net\nrelating to investments. The amount in 2020 and 2019 included total charges of $98 million, and $30 million, respectively, recorded in\nCost of products sold\nand\nResearch and development expense\nto write down the carrying value of certain assets.  The amount in 2019 also included an unrealized gain of $13 million recorded within\nOther (expense) income, net\nrelating to an investment.\n(f)\nRepresents costs required to develop processes and systems to comply with regulations such as the European Union Medical Device Regulation (\"EUMDR\") and General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"). These costs were recorded in\nCost of products sold\nand\nResearch and development expense\n.\n(g)\nThe amount in 2019 included additional tax benefit, net, of $50 million relating to U.S. tax legislation which is further discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nGross Profit Margin\nThe comparison of gross profit margins in 2021 and 2020 and the comparison of gross profit margins in 2020 and 2019 reflected the following impacts:\nThe impacts of other specified items on gross profit margin reflected the following:\n•\nThe impacts in 2021 and 2020 includes net charges of $56 million and $244 million, respectively, to record estimated future costs within the Medication Management Solutions unit associated with remediation efforts related to BD Alaris\nTM\ninfusion pumps. Based upon the course of our remediation efforts, our estimate of these future costs may change over time.\n•\nThe impact in 2020 also includes $59 million of charges that were recorded to write down the carrying value of certain fixed assets in the Medical and Life Sciences segments, as discussed further above, and a $39 million charge to write down the carrying value of certain intangible assets in the Biosciences unit.\nOperating performance in 2021 and 2020 primarily reflected the following:\n•\nFavorable product mix in 2021 was driven by the recovery of demand for products with higher margins and the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit's COVID-19 testing sales.  We re-invested over $200 million of the profits from these sales into our BD 2025 strategy focus on growth, simplification and empowerment. Unfavorable product mix in 2020 due to pandemic-related declines was partially offset by the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit's sales related to COVID-19 testing.\n•\nOperating performance in 2021 benefited from a favorable comparison to 2020 which was unfavorably impacted by increased levels of manufacturing overhead costs that were recognized in the period\n34\nbecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, rather than capitalized within inventory. The higher levels of manufacturing overhead costs incurred in 2020 were driven, to a large extent, by the impact of lower plant utilization in our highly automated manufacturing sites.\n•\nOperating performance in 2021 reflected approximately $93 million of excess and obsolete inventory expenses related to COVID-19 testing inventory which were recognized by the Integrated Diagnostic Solutions unit.\n•\nLower manufacturing costs resulting from continuous improvement projects and synergy initiatives favorably impacted operating performance in 2021 and 2020. This favorable impact was largely offset by higher raw material costs in 2021.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nSelling and administrative\nSelling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2021 was lower compared with 2020 due to the recovery of revenues in 2021. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2021 was unfavorably impacted by foreign currency translation and higher shipping costs as a result of expedited shipments relating to COVID-19, as well as by higher selling, travel and other administrative costs compared with 2020, which benefited from cost containment measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSlightly higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in 2020 compared with 2019 reflected the decline in revenues in 2020, higher shipping costs as a result of expedited shipments relating to COVID-19, as well as $25 million of funding for the BD Foundation. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by lower selling expenses and favorable foreign currency translation. Selling and administrative spending in 2020 reflected a disciplined spending and the achievement of cost synergies resulting from our acquisition of Bard, as well as cost containment measures enacted to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expense as a percentage of revenues in 2021 was higher compared with 2020 which reflected our reinvestment of COVID-19 testing-related sales profits into our growth initiatives and additional investments in COVID-19 testing solutions, as further discussed above.\nResearch and development expense as a percentage of revenues in 2020 was higher compared with 2019 primarily due to investments in compliance with emerging regulations and investments in COVID-19 testing solutions, as further discussed above.  Spending in 2021, 2020 and 2019 reflected our continued commitment to\n35\ninvest in new products and platforms.  As further discussed above, expenses in 2019 included certain write-down charges in the Surgery unit.\nAcquisitions and other restructurings\nCosts relating to acquisitions and other restructurings in 2021 and 2020 included integration costs incurred due to our acquisition of Bard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Costs in 2021 and 2020 additionally included restructuring costs related to simplification and cost saving initiatives. Costs relating to acquisition and other restructurings in 2020 and 2019 also included restructuring costs relating to the Bard acquisition.  For further disclosures regarding the costs relating to restructurings, refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOther operating expense, net\nOther operating expense in 2021, 2020 and 2019 included the following items which are further discussed in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data:\n(a)\nRepresents costs incurred for consulting, legal, tax and other advisory services associated with the planned spin-off of BD's Diabetes Care business.\nNet Interest Expense\nLower interest expense in 2021 and 2020 compared with the prior-year periods reflected debt repayments and lower overall interest rates on debt outstanding during 2021 and 2020. Additional disclosures regarding our financing arrangements and debt instruments are provided in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax rates in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n36\nThe effective income tax rate in 2021 reflected the impact of discrete tax items, as well as an impact from specified items in 2021 that was more favorable compared with the benefit associated with specified items in 2020. The impact from specified items in 2020 was less favorable compared with the benefit associated with specified items in 2019. The effective income tax rate in 2019 also reflected a favorable impact relating to the timing of certain discrete items, as well as the recognition of $50 million of tax benefit recorded for the impacts of U.S. tax legislation that was enacted in December 2017. For further disclosures regarding our accounting for this U.S. tax legislation, refer to Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nNet Income and Diluted Earnings per Share\nNet Income and Diluted Earnings per Share in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nFinancial Instrument Market Risk\nWe selectively use financial instruments to manage market risk, primarily foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk relating to our ongoing business operations. The counterparties to these contracts are highly rated financial institutions. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nBD and its subsidiaries transact business in various foreign currencies throughout Europe, Greater Asia, Canada and Latin America. We face foreign currency exposure from the effect of fluctuating exchange rates on payables and receivables relating to transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currency. These payables and receivables primarily arise from intercompany transactions. We hedge substantially all such exposures, primarily through the use of forward contracts.  We have also hedged the currency exposure associated with investments in certain foreign subsidiaries with instruments such as foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps, which are designated as net investment hedges, as well as currency exchange contracts.  We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our worldwide operations, including sales, to the U.S. dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of a reporting period.  We did not enter into contracts to hedge cash flows against these foreign currency fluctuations in fiscal year 2021 or 2020.\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value. For foreign currency derivatives, market risk is determined by calculating the impact on fair value of an assumed change in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Fair values were estimated based upon observable inputs, specifically spot currency rates and foreign currency prices for similar assets and liabilities.\nWith respect to the foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding at September 30, 2021 and 2020, the impact that changes in the U.S. dollar would have on pre-tax earnings was estimated as follows:\n37\nThese calculations do not reflect the impact of exchange gains or losses on the underlying transactions that would substantially offset the results of the derivative instruments.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWhen managing interest rate exposures, we strive to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and floating rate instruments. We may enter into interest rate swaps to help maintain this balance and manage debt and interest-bearing investments in tandem, since these items have an offsetting impact on interest rate exposure. For interest rate derivative instruments, fair values are measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows using market-based observable inputs including credit risk and interest rate yield curves. Market risk for these instruments is determined by calculating the impact to fair value of an assumed change in interest rates across all maturities.\nThe impact that changes in interest rates would have on interest rate derivatives outstanding at September 30, 2021 and 2020, as well as the effect that changes in interest rates would have on our earnings or cash flows over a one-year period, based upon our overall interest rate exposure, were estimated as follows:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur strong financial position and cash flow performance have provided us with the capacity to accelerate our innovation pipeline through investments in research and development, as well as through strategic acquisitions. We believe that our available cash and cash equivalents, our ability to generate operating cash flow, and if needed, our access to borrowings from our financing facilities provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our foreseeable operating needs.  The following table summarizes our consolidated statement of cash flows in 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nNet Cash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities in 2021 reflected higher net income, which was driven by strong revenue performance, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net source of cash. This net source of cash primarily reflected higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by higher levels of prepaid expenses, inventory and trade receivables.  Cash flows from operating activities in 2021 additionally reflected a $16 million discretionary cash contribution to fund our pension obligation.\nCash flows from operating activities in 2020 reflected net income, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net source of cash. This net source of cash primarily reflected higher levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses and lower levels of prepaid expenses, partially offset by higher levels of inventory and trade receivables.\nCash flows from operating activities in 2019 reflected net income, adjusted by a change in operating assets and liabilities that was a net use of cash. This net use of cash primarily reflected lower levels of accounts\n38\npayable and accrued expenses and higher levels of inventory, partially offset by lower levels of prepaid expenses. The lower levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses were primarily attributable to cash paid related to income taxes and our product liability matters, as well as the timing and amount of interest payments due in the period. Cash flows from operating activities in 2019 additionally reflected $200 million of discretionary cash contributions to fund our pension obligation.\nNet Cash Flows from Investing Activities\nCapital expenditures\nOur investments in capital expenditures are focused on projects that enhance our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities, and support our strategy of geographic expansion with select investments in growing markets. Capital expenditures of $1.231 billion, $810 million and $957 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily related to manufacturing capacity expansions.  Details of spending by segment are contained in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nAcquisitions\nCash outflows for acquisitions in 2021 and 2020 included cash payments relating to various strategic acquisitions we have executed as part of our growth strategy, including our acquisition of Tepha, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2021 and our acquisition of Straub Medical AG in the third quarter of 2020.\nDivestitures\nCash inflows relating to divestitures in 2019 were $477 million.  For further discussion, refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nNet Cash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash from financing activities in 2021, 2020 and 2019 included the following significant cash flows:\nAdditional disclosures regarding the equity and debt-related financing activities detailed above are provided in Notes 3 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n39\nDebt-Related Activities\nCertain measures relating to our total debt were as follows:\n(a)\nRepresents shareholders’ equity, net non-current deferred income tax liabilities, and debt.\nThe decreases in our total debt at September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 reflected repayments and redemptions of certain notes, partially offset by issuances of long-term notes in 2021 and 2020.  Additional disclosures regarding our debt instruments are provided in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nCash and Short-term Investments\nAt September 30, 2021, total worldwide cash and equivalents and short-term investments, including restricted cash, were $2.403 billion. These assets were largely held in jurisdictions outside of the United States. We regularly review the amount of cash and short-term investments held outside of the United States and our historical foreign earnings are used to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditure needs.  To fund cash needs in the United States, we rely on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and remittances from foreign subsidiaries of earnings that are not considered to be permanently reinvested.\nFinancing Facilities\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company refinanced its five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was to expire in December 2022, with a new five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in September 2026.  The credit facility provides borrowings of up to $2.75 billion, with separate sub-limits of $100 million for letters of credit and swingline loans. The expiration date of the credit facility may be extended for up to two additional one year periods, subject to certain restrictions (including the consent of the lenders). The credit facility provides that we may, subject to additional commitments by lenders, request an additional $500 million of financing, for a maximum aggregate commitment under the credit facility of up to $3.25 billion. Proceeds from this facility may be used for general corporate purposes.  There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility at September 30, 2021.\nThe agreement for our revolving credit facility contains the following financial covenants. We were in compliance with these covenants, as applicable, as of September 30, 2021.\n•\nWe are required to have a leverage coverage ratio of no more than:\n◦\n4.25-to-1 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter following the closing of the credit facility; or\n◦\n4.75-to-1 for the four full fiscal quarters following the consummation of a material acquisition.\nWe also have informal lines of credit outside the United States. We may, from time to time, access the commercial paper market as we manage working capital over the normal course of our business activities.  We had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2021.  Also, over the normal course of our business activities, we transfer certain trade receivable assets to third parties under factoring agreements. Additional disclosures regarding sales of trade receivable assets are provided in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\n40\nAccess to Capital and Credit Ratings\nOur corporate credit ratings with the rating agencies Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (“S&P”), Moody's Investor Service (“Moody's”) and Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) were as follows at September 30, 2021:\nIn January 2021, S&P affirmed our September 30, 2020 ratings and revised the agency's outlook on our ratings to Stable from Negative. Also in January 2021, Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured rating to Baa3 from Ba1, as well as our commercial paper rating to P-3 from NP. Moody’s also affirmed its positive outlook on our ratings. In May 2021, Fitch affirmed our September 30, 2020 rating and revised its outlook on our ratings from Stable to Positive.\nLower corporate debt ratings and downgrades of our corporate credit ratings or other credit ratings may increase our cost of borrowing. We believe that given our debt ratings, our financial management policies, our ability to generate cash flow and the non-cyclical, geographically diversified nature of our businesses, we would have access to additional short-term and long-term capital should the need arise. A rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change.\nContractual Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that obligate us to make payments in the future. Information regarding our obligations under purchase, debt and lease arrangements are provided in Notes 5, 15 and 17, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe following discussion supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results could differ from those estimates. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For any given estimate or assumption made by management, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. Actual results that differ from management’s estimates could have an unfavorable effect on our consolidated financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements:\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues are primarily recognized when the customer obtains control of the product sold, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement.\n41\nRevenues associated with certain instruments and equipment for which installation is complex, and therefore significantly affects the customer’s ability to use and benefit from the product, are recognized when customer acceptance of these installed products has been confirmed. For certain service arrangements, including extended warranty and software maintenance contracts, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term. The majority of revenues relating to extended warranty contracts associated with certain instruments and equipment is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over a longer period.\nOur agreements with customers within certain organizational units including Medication Management Solutions, Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences, contain multiple performance obligations including both products and certain services noted above. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately may require judgment.  The transaction price for these agreements is allocated to each performance obligation based upon its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is the amount at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. We generally estimate standalone selling prices using list prices and a consideration of typical discounts offered to customers.  The use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.\nOur gross revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which include rebates and sales discounts. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and judgment is required when determining the impact on gross revenues for a reporting period. Additional factors considered in the estimate of our rebate liability include the quantification of inventory that is either in stock at or in transit to our distributors, as well as the estimated lag time between the sale of product and the payment of corresponding rebates.\nImpairment of Assets\nGoodwill assets are subject to impairment reviews at least annually, or whenever indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with finite lives, including developed technology, and other long-lived assets, are periodically reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. Our reporting units generally represent one level below reporting segments. Our review of goodwill for each reporting unit compares the fair value of the reporting unit, estimated using an income approach, with its carrying value. Our annual goodwill impairment test performed on July 1, 2021 did not result in any impairment charges, as the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.\nWe generally use the income approach to derive the fair value for impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures the value of our income producing assets. This approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume, revenue and expense growth rates, changes in working capital use, appropriate discount rates, terminal values and other assumptions and estimates. The estimates and assumptions used are consistent with BD’s business plans. The use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset. Actual results may differ from management’s estimates.\nIncome Taxes\nBD maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in our tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carry back and carry forward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset.\nBD conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we\n42\nrecord accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions, our past audit experience with similar situations, and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters. BD’s effective tax rate in any given period could be impacted if, upon resolution with taxing authorities, we prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established, or we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves.\nWe have reviewed our needs in the United States for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and we continue to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the United States to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditure needs.     As a result, we are permanently reinvested with respect to all of our historical foreign earnings as of September 30, 2021.  Additional disclosures regarding our accounting for income taxes are provided in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nContingencies\nWe are involved, both as a plaintiff and a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, product liability and environmental matters, as further discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. We assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. We establish accruals to the extent probable future losses are estimable (in the case of environmental matters, without considering possible third-party recoveries). A determination of the amount of accruals for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual matter. When appropriate, the accrual is developed with the consultation of outside counsel and, as in the case of certain mass tort litigation, the expertise of an actuarial specialist regarding the nature, timing and extent of each matter. The accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our litigation strategy.  We record expected recoveries from product liability insurance carriers or other parties when realization of recovery is deemed probable.\nGiven the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, liability insurance. In the opinion of management, any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on BD’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated net cash flows.\nBenefit Plans\nWe have significant net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations that are measured using actuarial valuations which include assumptions for the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion.\nThe discount rate is selected each year based on investment grade bonds and other factors as of the measurement date (September 30). Specifically for the U.S. pension plan, we will use a discount rate of 2.89% for 2022, which was based on an actuarially-determined, company-specific yield curve to measure liabilities as of the measurement date.  To calculate the pension expense in 2022, we will apply the individual spot rates along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each future cash outflow for benefit payments in order to calculate interest cost and service cost. Additional disclosures regarding the method to be used in calculating the interest cost and service cost components of pension expense for 2022 are provided in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, although reviewed each year, changes less frequently due to the long-term nature of the assumption. This assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of the measurement date; rather, it is used only in the calculation of pension expense. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider many factors, including our historical assumptions compared with actual results; benchmark data; expected returns on various plan asset\n43\nclasses, as well as current and expected asset allocations. We will use a long-term expected rate of return on plan assets assumption of 6.25% for the U.S. pension plan in 2022. We believe our discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors.\nSensitivity to changes in key assumptions for our U.S. pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans are as follows:\n•\nDiscount rate — A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $6 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the total U.S. net pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plan costs.  This estimate assumes no change in the shape or steepness of the company-specific yield curve used to plot the individual spot rates that will be applied to the future cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost.\n•\nExpected return on plan assets — A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $5 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on U.S. pension plan costs.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. BD and its representatives may also, from time to time, make certain forward-looking statements in publicly released materials, both written and oral, including statements contained in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, and our reports to shareholders. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plan,” “expect,” “believe,” “intend,” “will,” “may,” “anticipate,” “estimate” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things, discussions of future operations and financial performance (including volume growth, pricing, sales and earnings per share growth, and cash flows) and statements regarding our strategy for growth, future product development, regulatory approvals, competitive position and expenditures.  All statements that address our future operating performance or events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are, and will be, based on management’s then-current views and assumptions regarding future events, developments and operating performance, and speak only as of their dates. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from our expectations and projections. Investors are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Furthermore, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events and developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law or regulations.\nThe following are some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements. For further discussion of certain of these factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report.\n•\nAny impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including, without limitation, decreases in the demand for our products or disruptions to our operations or our supply chain, and factors such as the rate of vaccination, the rate of infections and competitive factors could impact the demand and pricing for our COVID-19 diagnostics testing.\n•\nWeakness in the global economy and financial markets, which could increase the cost of operating our business, weaken demand for our products and services, negatively impact the prices we can charge for our products and services, or impair our ability to produce our products.\n•\nThe risks associated with the proposed spin-off of our Diabetes Care business, including factors that could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the completion, timing or terms of the spin-off, our ability to realize the expected benefits of the spin-off, or the qualification of the spin-off as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n44\n•\nCompetitive factors that could adversely affect our operations, including new product introductions and technologies (for example, new forms of drug delivery) by our current or future competitors, consolidation or strategic alliances among healthcare companies, distributors and/or payers of healthcare to improve their competitive position or develop new models for the delivery of healthcare, increased pricing pressure due to the impact of low-cost manufacturers, patents attained by competitors (particularly as patents on our products expire), new entrants into our markets and changes in the practice of medicine.\n•\nRisks relating to our overall level of indebtedness, including our ability to service our debt and refinance our indebtedness, which is dependent upon the capital markets and our overall financial condition at such time.\n•\nThe adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n•\nRegional, national and foreign economic factors, including inflation, deflation and fluctuations in interest rates, and their potential effect on our operating performance.\n•\nOur ability to achieve our projected level or mix of product sales, as our earnings forecasts are based on projected sales volumes and pricing of many product types, some of which are more profitable than others.\n•\nChanges in reimbursement practices of governments or third-party payers, or adverse decisions relating to our products by such payers, which could reduce demand for our products or the price we can charge for such products.\n•\nCost containment efforts in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business, such as alternative payment reform and increased use of competitive bidding and tenders, including, without limitation, any expansion of the volume-based procurement process in China.\n•\nChanges in the domestic and foreign healthcare industry or in medical practices that result in a reduction in procedures using our products or increased pricing pressures, including cost reduction measures instituted by and the continued consolidation among healthcare providers.\n•\nThe impact of changes in U.S. federal laws and policies that could affect fiscal and tax policies, healthcare and international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements. In particular, tariffs or other trade barriers imposed by the U.S. or other countries could adversely impact our supply chain costs or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations.\n•\nIncreases in operating costs, including fluctuations in the cost and availability of oil-based resins and other raw materials, as well as certain components, used in our products, including any disruptions in the global supply chain of raw materials and components, inflationary pricing pressure, labor shortages or increased labor costs, the ability to maintain favorable supplier and service arrangements and relationships (particularly with respect to sole-source suppliers and sterilization services), and the potential adverse effects of any disruption in the availability of such items and services.\n•\nSecurity breaches of our information systems or our products, which could impair our ability to conduct business, result in the loss of BD trade secrets or otherwise compromise sensitive information of BD or its customers, suppliers and other business partners, or of customers' patients, including sensitive personal data, or result in product efficacy or safety concerns for certain of our products, and result in actions by regulatory bodies or civil litigation.\n•\nDifficulties inherent in product development, including the potential inability to successfully continue technological innovation, successfully complete clinical trials, obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and registrations in the United States and abroad, obtain intellectual property protection for our products, obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for new products, or gain and maintain market approval of products, as well as the possibility of infringement claims by competitors with respect to patents or other intellectual property rights, all of which can preclude or delay commercialization of a product. Delays in\n45\nobtaining necessary approvals or clearances from the FDA or other regulatory agencies or changes in the regulatory process may also delay product launches and increase development costs.\n•\nThe impact of business combinations or divestitures, including any volatility in earnings relating to acquisition-related costs, and our ability to successfully integrate any business we may acquire.\n•\nOur ability to penetrate or expand our operations in emerging markets, which depends on local economic and political conditions, and how well we are able to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities and distribution networks.\n•\nConditions in international markets, including social and political conditions, civil unrest, terrorist activity, governmental changes, restrictions on the ability to transfer capital across borders, tariffs and other protectionist measures, difficulties in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and governmental expropriation of assets. Our international operations also increase our compliance risks, including risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, as well as regulatory and privacy laws.\n•\nDeficit reduction efforts or other actions that reduce the availability of government funding for healthcare and research, which could weaken demand for our products and result in additional pricing pressures, as well as create potential collection risks associated with such sales.\n•\nFluctuations in university or U.S. and international governmental funding and policies for life sciences research.\n•\nFluctuations in the demand for products we sell to pharmaceutical companies that are used to manufacture, or are sold with, the products of such companies, as a result of funding constraints, consolidation or otherwise.\n•\nThe effects of climate change, weather, regulatory or other events that adversely impact our supply chain, including our ability to manufacture our products (particularly where production of a product line or sterilization operations are concentrated in one or more plants), source materials or components or services from suppliers (including sole-source suppliers) that are needed for such manufacturing (including sterilization), or provide products to our customers, including events that impact key distributors.\n•\nNatural disasters, including the impacts of climate change, hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, fires, earthquakes and floods and other extreme weather events, global health pandemics, war, terrorism, labor disruptions and international conflicts that could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability, resulting in decreased demand for our products, or adversely affecting our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or causing interruptions in our supply chain.\n•\nPending and potential future litigation or other proceedings asserting, and/or investigations concerning and/or subpoenas and requests seeking information with respect to, alleged violations of law (including in connection with federal and/or state healthcare programs (such as Medicare or Medicaid) and/or sales and marketing practices (such as investigative subpoenas and the civil investigative demands received by BD)), potential anti-corruption and related internal control violations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, antitrust claims, securities law claims, product liability (which may involve lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation proceedings, including pending claims relating to our hernia repair implant products, surgical continence products for women and vena cava filter products), claims with respect to environmental matters, data privacy breaches and patent infringement, and the availability or collectability of insurance relating to any such claims.\n•\nNew or changing laws and regulations affecting our domestic and foreign operations, or changes in enforcement practices, including laws relating to trade, monetary and fiscal policies, taxation (including tax reforms that could adversely impact multinational corporations), sales practices, environmental protection, price controls, and licensing and regulatory requirements for new products and products in the post-marketing phase. In particular, the U.S. and other countries may impose new requirements\n46\nregarding registration, labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to re-register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products. Environmental laws, particularly with respect to the emission of greenhouse gases, are also becoming more stringent throughout the world, which may increase our costs of operations or necessitate changes in our manufacturing plants or processes or those of our suppliers, or result in liability to BD.\n•\nProduct efficacy or safety concerns regarding our products resulting in product holds or recalls, regulatory action on the part of the FDA or foreign counterparts (including restrictions on future product clearances and civil penalties), declining sales and product liability claims, and damage to our reputation. As a result of the CareFusion acquisition, our U.S. infusion pump business is operating under a Consent Decree with the FDA. The Consent Decree authorizes the FDA, in the event of any violations in the future, to order our U.S. infusion pump business to cease manufacturing and distributing products, recall products or take other actions, and order the payment of significant monetary damages if the business subject to the decree fails to comply with any provision of the Consent Decree.  We are undertaking certain remediation of our BD Alaris\nTM\nSystem, and are currently shipping the product in the U.S., only in cases of medical necessity and to remediate recalled software versions. We will not be able to fully resume commercial operations for the BD Alaris System in the U.S. until a 510(k) submission relating to the product has been cleared by the FDA. No assurances can be given as to when or if clearance will be obtained from the FDA.\n•\nThe effect of adverse media exposure or other publicity regarding BD’s business or operations, including the effect on BD’s reputation or demand for its products.\n•\nThe effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in BD’s pension plans and on actuarial interest rate and asset return assumptions, which could require BD to make additional contributions to the plans or increase our pension plan expense.\n•\nOur ability to obtain the anticipated benefits of restructuring programs, if any, that we may undertake.\n•\nIssuance of new or revised accounting standards by the FASB or the SEC.\nThe foregoing list sets forth many, but not all, of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties."

    "text": "Reports of Management\nManagement’s Responsibilities\nThe following financial statements have been prepared by management in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include, where required, amounts based on the best estimates and judgments of management. The integrity and objectivity of data in the financial statements and elsewhere in this Annual Report are the responsibility of management.\nIn fulfilling its responsibilities for the integrity of the data presented and to safeguard the Company’s assets, management employs a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance, at appropriate cost, that the Company’s assets are protected and that transactions are appropriately authorized, recorded and summarized. This system of control is supported by the selection of qualified personnel, by organizational assignments that provide appropriate delegation of authority and division of responsibilities, and by the dissemination of written policies and procedures. This control structure is further reinforced by a program of internal audits, including a policy that requires responsive action by management.\nThe Board of Directors monitors the internal control system, including internal accounting and financial reporting controls, through its Audit Committee, which consists of eight independent Directors. The Audit Committee meets periodically with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and management to review the work of each and to satisfy itself that they are properly discharging their responsibilities. The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit Committee and meet with its members, with and without management present, to discuss the scope and results of their audits including internal control, auditing and financial reporting matters.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended. Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework).\nBased on the Company's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the criteria noted above, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2021.\nThe financial statements and internal control over financial reporting have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Ernst & Young’s reports with respect to fairness of the presentation of the financial statements, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, are included herein.\n48\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Becton, Dickinson and Company (the Company) as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 24, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n49\n50\n51\n52\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Becton, Dickinson and Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Becton, Dickinson and Company (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated November 24, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n53\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n54\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nYears Ended September 30\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n55\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nYears Ended September 30\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n56\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nSeptember 30\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n57\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nYears Ended September 30\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n58\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nMillions of dollars, except per share amounts or as otherwise specified\nNote 1 —\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Becton, Dickinson and Company (the \"Company\" or \"BD\") have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\").  Within the financial statements and tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes.  Percentages and earnings per share amounts presented are calculated from the underlying amounts.  Our fiscal year ends on September 30.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its majority-owned subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany transactions.  The Company has no material interests in variable interest entities.\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at time of purchase.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash consists of cash restricted from withdrawal and usage and largely represents funds that are restricted for certain product liability matters assumed in the acquisition of C.R. Bard, Inc. (\"Bard\"), which are further discussed in Note 5.\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company grants credit to customers in the normal course of business and the resulting trade receivables are stated at their net realizable value.  The allowance for doubtful accounts represents the Company’s estimate of expected credit losses relating to trade receivables and is determined based on historical experience, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts and other specific account data.  Amounts are written off against the allowances for doubtful accounts when the Company determines that a customer account is uncollectable.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of approximate cost or net realizable value determined on the first-in, first-out basis.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are principally provided on the straight-line basis over estimated useful lives, which range from\n20\nto\n45\nyears for buildings,\nfour\nto\n13\nyears for machinery and equipment and\none\nto\n20\nyears for leasehold improvements.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $\n731\nmillion, $\n646\nmillion and $\n633\nmillion in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n59\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe Company’s unamortized intangible assets include goodwill which arise from acquisitions of businesses. The Company currently reviews goodwill for impairment using quantitative models.  Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component.  The Company’s reporting units generally represent one level below reporting segments.  The Company’s review of goodwill for each reporting unit compares the fair value of the reporting unit, estimated using an income approach, with its carrying value.  The annual impairment review performed on July 1, 2021 indicated that all identified reporting units’ fair values exceeded their respective carrying values.\nAmortized intangible assets include developed technology assets which arise from acquisitions.  These assets represent acquired intellectual property that is already technologically feasible upon the acquisition date or acquired in-process research and development assets that are completed subsequent to acquisition.  Developed technology assets are generally amortized over periods ranging from\n15\nto\n20\nyears, using the straight-line method.  Customer relationship assets are generally amortized over periods ranging from\n10\nto\n15\nyears, using the straight-line method.  Other intangibles with finite useful lives, which include patents, are amortized over periods principally ranging from\none\nto\n40\nyears, using the straight-line method.  Finite-lived intangible assets, including developed technology assets, are periodically reviewed when impairment indicators are present to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows.  The carrying values of these finite-lived assets are compared to the undiscounted cash flows they are expected to generate and an impairment loss is recognized in operating results to the extent any finite-lived intangible asset’s carrying value exceeds its calculated fair value.\nForeign Currency Translation\nGenerally, foreign subsidiaries’ functional currency is the local currency of operations and the net assets of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates.  The U.S. dollar results that arise from such translation, as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature, are included in the foreign currency translation adjustments in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the customer obtains control of the product, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement.  Revenues associated with certain instruments and equipment for which installation is complex, and therefore significantly affects the customer’s ability to use and benefit from the product, are recognized upon customer acceptance of these installed products.  Revenue for certain service arrangements, including extended warranty and software maintenance contracts, is recognized ratably over the contract term.  When arrangements include multiple performance obligations, the total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation.  Variable consideration such as rebates, sales discounts and sales returns are estimated and treated as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related revenue is recognized.  These estimates are based on contractual terms, historical practices, and current trends, and are adjusted as new information becomes available.  Revenues exclude any taxes that the Company collects from customers and remits to tax authorities.\nEquipment lease transactions with customers are evaluated and classified as either operating or sales-type leases.  Generally, these arrangements are accounted for as operating leases and therefore, revenue is recognized at the contracted rate over the rental period defined within the customer agreement.\nAdditional disclosures regarding the Company's accounting for revenue recognition are provided in Note 6.\n60\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nShipping and Handling Costs\nThe Company considers its shipping and handling costs to be contract fulfillment costs and records them within\nSelling and administrative expense.\nShipping expense was $\n656\nmillion, $\n551\nmillion and $\n511\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nContingencies\nThe Company establishes accruals for future losses which are both probable and can be reasonably estimated (and in the case of environmental matters, without considering possible third-party recoveries).\nAdditional disclosures regarding the Company's accounting for contingencies are provided in Note 5.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nAll derivatives are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.  Any deferred gains or losses associated with derivative instruments are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying hedged transaction is recognized.  The cash flows related to the Company's derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are reported as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.  Cash flows for all other derivatives, including undesignated hedges, are classified in the same line item as the cash flows of the related hedged item, which is generally within operating or financing activities.\nAdditional disclosures regarding the Company's accounting for derivative instruments are provided in Note 13.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has reviewed its needs in the United States for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and continues to invest foreign subsidiaries earnings outside of the United States to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment expenditure needs.  As a result, the Company is permanently reinvested with respect to all of its historical foreign earnings as of September 30, 2021.  Deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested.  The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions.  In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, the Company records accruals for uncertain tax positions based on the technical support for the positions, past audit experience with similar situations, and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters.\nThe Company maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.  Changes in valuation allowances are included in the tax provision in the period of change.  In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.\nAdditional disclosures regarding the Company's accounting for income taxes are provided in Note 16.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.  In computing diluted earnings per share, only potential common shares that are dilutive (i.e., those that reduce earnings per share or increase loss per share) are included in the calculation.\n61\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nFair Value Measurements\nA fair value hierarchy is applied to prioritize inputs used in measuring fair value.  The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are detailed below.  Additional disclosures regarding the Company’s fair value measurements are provided in Notes 9 and 14.\nLevel 1 — Inputs to the valuation methodology which represent unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Inputs to the valuation methodology which include: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 — Inputs to the valuation methodology which are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions.  These estimates or assumptions affect reported assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as reflected in the consolidated financial statements.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nBD’s Intention to Spin Off Diabetes Care\nOn May 6, 2021, the Company announced its intention to spin off its Diabetes Care business as a separate publicly traded company to BD’s shareholders.  The proposed spin-off is intended to be a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is expected to be completed in the first half of calendar year 2022,\nsubject to the satisfaction of customary conditions\n, including final approval from BD’s Board of Directors and the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form 10.\nNote 2 —\nAccounting Changes\nNew Accounting Principles Adopted\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued a new accounting standard which requires earlier recognition of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by entities, including trade receivables.  The new standard requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at each reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  The Company’s adoption of this accounting standard on October 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective method, did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company retrospectively adopted an accounting standard update which added, removed and clarified disclosure requirements relating to defined benefit plans and other postretirement plans.  The Company’s adoption of this update on October 1, 2020 did not materially impact its disclosures.  See Note 9 for the Company’s defined pension plan and other benefit plan disclosures.\nIn July 2018, the FASB issued accounting standard update (“ASU”) ASU 2018-09, \"Codification Improvements\", which, among other items, amended an illustrative example of a fair value hierarchy disclosure to indicate that a certain type of investment should not always be considered to be eligible to use the net asset value (\"NAV\") per share practical expedient.  Also, it further clarified that an entity should evaluate whether a readily determinable fair value exists or whether its investments qualify for the NAV practical expedient.  The Company early adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 on a prospective basis, which is reflected in the fair value hierarchy classification of pension assets in Note 9, but does not change the fair value measurements of the investments.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for\n62\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\ncapitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal use software license).  The Company early adopted this standard as of April 1, 2020 on a prospective basis.  The adoption of this standard did not materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued a new lease accounting standard which requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet, as well as expanded disclosures regarding leasing arrangements.  The Company adopted this standard on October 1, 2019, and elected certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, including a transition method which allows application of the new standard at its adoption date, rather than at the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements.  The Company also elected not to perform any reassessments relative to its expired and existing leases upon its adoption of the new requirements.  The Company's adoption of this standard did not materially impact its consolidated financial statements.  Additional disclosures regarding the Company’s lease arrangements are provided in Note 17.\nOn October 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (\"ASC 606\") using the modified retrospective method.  Under ASC 606, revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of goods or services to customers and reflects the amount of consideration to which a reporting entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The Company assessed the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements based upon a review of contracts that were not completed as of October 1, 2018. This accounting standard adoption, which is further discussed in Note 6, did not materially impact any line items of the Company's consolidated income statements and balance sheet.\nOn October 1, 2018, the Company retrospectively adopted an accounting standard update which requires all components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs to be disaggregated from the service cost component and to be presented on the income statement outside a subtotal of income from operations, if one is presented.  Upon the Company's adoption of the accounting standard update, which did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements, all components of the Company’s net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, aside from service cost, are recorded to\nOther (expense) income, net\non its consolidated income statements for all periods presented.\nOn October 1, 2018, the Company adopted an accounting standard update which requires that the income tax effects of intercompany sales or transfers of assets, except those involving inventory, be recognized in the income statement as income tax expense (or benefit) in the period that the sale or transfer occurs.  The Company adopted this accounting standard update, which did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements, using the modified retrospective method.\n63\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nNote 3 —\nShareholders’ Equity\nChanges in certain components of shareholders’ equity were as follows:\n(a)\nCommon stock held in trusts represents rabbi trusts in connection with deferred compensation under the Company’s employee salary and bonus deferral plan and directors’ deferral plan.\n64\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nShare Repurchases\nIn fiscal year 2021, the Company executed\ntwo\naccelerated share repurchase agreements and accounted for each agreement as\ntwo\ntransactions upon prepayment: (1) the initial delivery of shares was recorded as an increase to\nCommon stock in treasury\nto recognize the acquisition of common stock acquired in a treasury stock transaction, and (2) the remaining amount of shares was recorded as a decrease to\nCapital in excess of par value\nto recognize a net share-settled forward sale contract indexed to the Company's own common stock.\nThe impacts of these accelerated share repurchase transactions were as follows:\n(a)    Upon final settlement of each repurchase agreement and the forward sale contract, the Company’s receipt of additional shares was recorded as an increase to\nCommon stock in treasury\nand an offsetting increase to\nCapital in excess of par value\n.  The final settlement for the fourth quarter transaction amounted to $\n150\nmillion.\nThe Company also repurchased approximately\n2.066\nmillion shares of its common stock during fiscal year 2021 through open market repurchases, which were recorded as a $\n500\nmillion increase to\nCommon stock in treasury\n.\nThe share repurchases discussed above were made pursuant to the repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors on September 24, 2013 for\n10\nmillion shares, for which there is no expiration date.  In November 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to an additional\n10\nmillion shares of BD common stock, for which there is no expiration date.\nCommon and Preferred Stock Conversions and Offerings\nIn accordance with their terms, the Company's\n2.475\nmillion mandatory convertible preferred shares that were issued in May 2017 in connection with the Company's acquisition of Bard were converted into\n11.703\nmillion shares of BD common stock on the mandatory conversion date of May 1, 2020.\nAlso in May 2020, the Company completed registered public offerings of equity securities including:\n•\n6.250\nmillion shares of the Company's common stock for net proceeds of $\n1.459\nbillion (gross proceeds of $\n1.500\nbillion).\n•\n1.500\nmillion shares of the Company's mandatory convertible preferred stock (ownership is held in the form of depositary shares, each representing a 1/20th interest in a share of preferred stock) for net proceeds of $\n1.459\nbillion (gross proceeds of $\n1.500\nbillion).  If and when declared, dividends on the mandatory convertible preferred stock will be payable on a cumulative basis at an annual rate of\n6.00\n% on the liquidation preference of $\n1,000\nper preferred share ($\n50\nper depositary share).  The shares of preferred stock are convertible to a minimum of\n5.2\nmillion and up to a maximum of\n6.2\nmillion shares of Company common stock at an exchange ratio, based on the market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of conversion, and no later than the mandatory conversion date of June 1, 2023.\n65\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nThe components and changes of\nAccumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss)\nwere as follows:\nThe amount of foreign currency translation recognized in other comprehensive income during the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 included net gains (losses) relating to net investment hedges, as further discussed in Note 13.  Other comprehensive income relating to benefit plans during the year ended September 30, 2021 included a net gain of $\n24\nmillion recognized as a result of the Company’s remeasurement, as of October 31, 2020, of the legacy Bard U.S. defined pension benefit plan upon its merger with the BD defined benefit cash balance pension plan in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.  The amounts recognized in other comprehensive income relating to cash flow hedges in 2021 and 2020 related to forward starting interest rate swaps.  Additional disclosures regarding the Company's derivatives are provided in Note 13.\nThe tax impacts for amounts recognized in other comprehensive income before reclassifications were as follows:\nThe tax impacts for cash flow hedges recognized in other comprehensive income before reclassifications in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial results.  The tax impacts for reclassifications out of\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nrelating to benefit plans and cash flow hedges in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were also immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial results.\nNote 4 —\nEarnings per Share\nThe weighted average common shares used in the computations of basic and diluted earnings per share (shares in thousands) for the years ended September 30 were as follows:\n66\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\n(a)\nIn 2021, 2020 and 2019, dilutive share equivalents associated with mandatory convertible preferred stock of\n6\nmillion,\n9\nmillion and\n12\nmillion, respectively, were excluded from the diluted shares outstanding calculation because the result would have been antidilutive.  The issuance of the convertible preferred stock is further discussed in Note 3.\n(b)\nIn both 2021 and 2020,\n1\nmillion of certain share-based compensation awards were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation as the exercise prices of these awards were greater than the average market price of the Company’s common shares. In 2019,\nno\nsuch awards were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation. Additional disclosures regarding the Company’s share-based compensation are provided in Note 8.\nNote 5 —\nCommitments and Contingencies\nCommitments\nThe Company has certain future purchase commitments entered in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital requirements. As of September 30, 2021, these commitments aggregated to approximately $\n1.670\nbillion and will be expended over the next several years.\nContingencies\nGiven the uncertain nature of litigation generally, the Company is not able, in all cases, to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation in which the Company is a party.  With respect to putative class action lawsuits in the United States and certain of the Canadian lawsuits described below relating to product liability matters, the Company is unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses for the following reasons: (i) all or certain of the proceedings are in early stages; (ii) the Company has not received and reviewed complete information regarding all or certain of the plaintiffs and their medical conditions; and/or (iii) there are significant factual issues to be resolved.  In addition, there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of any class.  With respect to the civil investigative demands (“CIDs”) served by the Department of Justice, discussed below, the Company is unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses for the following reasons: (i) all or certain of the proceedings are in early stages; and/or (ii) there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved.\nIn view of the uncertainties discussed below, the Company could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, liability insurance.  In the opinion of management, any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows.\nProduct Liability Matters\nThe Company believes that certain settlements and judgments, as well as legal defense costs, may be covered under indemnification obligations from other parties, which if disputed, the Company intends to vigorously contest.  Amounts recovered under the Company’s product liability indemnification arrangements may be less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs relating to claims.  In addition, there is no guarantee that other parties will pay claims or that indemnity will be otherwise available.\nHernia Product Claims\nAs of September 30, 2021, the Company is defending approximately\n25,030\nproduct liability claims involving the Company’s line of hernia repair devices (collectively, the “Hernia Product Claims”).  The majority of those claims are currently pending in a coordinated proceeding in Rhode Island State Court and in a federal multi-district litigation (“MDL”) established in the Southern District of Ohio, but claims are also pending in other state and/or federal court jurisdictions.  In addition, those claims include multiple putative class actions in Canada.  Generally, the Hernia Product Claims seek damages for personal injury allegedly resulting from use of the products.  From time to time, the Company engages in resolution discussions with plaintiffs’ law firms regarding certain of the Hernia Product Claims, but the Company also intends to vigorously defend Hernia Product Claims that do not settle, including through litigation.  The first bellwether trial in the hernia\n67\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nMDL began in August 2021, resulting in a complete defense verdict.  Trials are scheduled into fiscal year 2022 in various state and/or federal courts, including one trial currently scheduled for January 2022 in the MDL.  The Company expects additional trials of Hernia Product Claims to take place over the next 12 months.  The Company cannot give any assurances that the resolution of the Hernia Product Claims that have not settled, including asserted and unasserted claims and the putative class action lawsuits, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nWomen’s Health Product Claims\nAs of September 30, 2021, the Company is defending approximately\n405\nproduct liability claims involving the Company’s line of pelvic mesh devices.  The majority of those claims are currently pending in various federal court jurisdictions, and a coordinated proceeding in New Jersey State Court, but claims are also pending in other state court jurisdictions.  In addition, those claims include putative class actions filed in the United States.  Not included in the figures above are approximately\n830\nfiled and unfiled claims that have been asserted or threatened against the Company but lack sufficient information to determine whether a pelvic mesh device of the Company is actually at issue.\nThe claims identified above also include products manufactured by both the Company and two subsidiaries of Medtronic plc (as successor in interest to Covidien plc) (“Medtronic”), each a supplier of the Company.  Medtronic has an obligation to defend and indemnify the Company with respect to any product defect liability relating to products its subsidiaries had manufactured.  In July 2015, the Company reached an agreement with Medtronic in which Medtronic agreed to take responsibility for pursuing settlement of certain of the Women’s Health Product Claims that relate to products distributed by the Company under supply agreements with Medtronic.  In June 2017, the Company amended the agreement with Medtronic to transfer responsibility for settlement of additional Women’s Health Product Claims to Medtronic on terms similar to the July 2015 agreement, including with respect to the obligation to make payments to Medtronic toward these potential settlements.  As of September 30, 2021, the Company has paid Medtronic $\n161\nmillion toward these potential settlements.  The Company also may, in its sole discretion, transfer responsibility for settlement of additional Women’s Health Product Claims to Medtronic on similar terms.  The agreements do not resolve the dispute between the Company and Medtronic with respect to Women’s Health Product Claims that do not settle, if any.  The foregoing lawsuits, unfiled claims, putative class actions, and other claims, together with claims that have settled or are the subject of agreements or agreements in principle to settle, are referred to collectively as the “Women’s Health Product Claims.”  The Women’s Health Product Claims generally seek damages for personal injury allegedly resulting from use of the products.\nAs of September 30, 2021, the Company has reached agreements or agreements in principle with various plaintiffs’ law firms to settle their respective inventories of cases totaling approximately\n15,295\nof the Women’s Health Product Claims.  The Company believes that these Women’s Health Product Claims are not the subject of Medtronic’s indemnification obligation.  These settlement agreements and agreements in principle include unfiled and previously unknown claims held by various plaintiffs’ law firms, which are not included in the approximate number of lawsuits set forth in the first paragraph of this section.  Each agreement is subject to certain conditions, including requirements for participation in the proposed settlements by a certain minimum number of plaintiffs.  The Company continues to engage in discussions with other plaintiffs’ law firms regarding potential resolution of unsettled Women’s Health Product Claims, which may include additional inventory settlements.\nA trial in the New Jersey coordinated proceeding began in March 2018, and in April 2018 a jury entered a verdict against the Company in the total amount of $\n68\nmillion ($\n33\nmillion compensatory; $\n35\nmillion punitive).  In March 2021, the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court vacated the verdict and ordered a new trial.  Plaintiffs have sought appeal of the reversal to the New Jersey Supreme Court and the Company has cross-appealed on a separate issue; the court has advised it will consider the appeal and cross-appeal.  Additional trials of Women’s Health Product Claims may take place over the next 12 months, which could potentially include consolidated trials.\n68\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nDuring the course of engaging in settlement discussions with plaintiffs’ law firms, the Company has learned, and may in future periods learn, additional information regarding these and other unfiled claims, or other lawsuits, which could materially impact the Company’s estimate of the number of claims or lawsuits against the Company.\nFilter Product Claims\nAs of September 30, 2021, the Company is defending approximately\n275\nproduct liability claims involving the Company’s line of inferior vena cava (“IVC”) filters (collectively, the “Filter Product Claims”).  The majority of those claims were previously pending in an MDL in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, but those MDL claims either have been, or are in the process of being, remanded to various federal jurisdictions.  Filter Product Claims are also pending in various state court jurisdictions, including a coordinated proceeding in Arizona State Court.  In addition, those claims include putative class actions filed in the United States and Canada.  The Filter Product Claims generally seek damages for personal injury allegedly resulting from use of the products.  The Company has limited information regarding the nature and quantity of certain of the Filter Product Claims.  The Company continues to receive claims and lawsuits and may in future periods learn additional information regarding other unfiled or unknown claims, or other lawsuits, which could materially impact the Company’s estimate of the number of claims or lawsuits against the Company.  On May 31, 2019, the MDL Court ceased accepting direct filings or transfers into the Filter Product Claims MDL and, as noted above, remands for non-settled cases have begun.  Federal and state court trials are scheduled over the next 12 months.  As of September 30, 2021, the Company entered into settlement agreements and/or settlement agreements in principle for approximately\n9,505\ncases.\nIn most product liability litigations (like those described above), plaintiffs allege a wide variety of claims, ranging from allegations of serious injury caused by the products to efforts to obtain compensation notwithstanding the absence of any injury. In many of these cases, the Company has not yet received and reviewed complete information regarding the plaintiffs and their medical conditions and, consequently, is unable to fully evaluate the claims.  The Company expects that it will receive and review additional information regarding any remaining unsettled product liability matters.\nOther Legal Matters\nThe Company is a potentially responsible party to a number of federal administrative proceedings in the United States brought under the Comprehensive Environment Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as “Superfund,” and similar state laws.  The affected sites are in varying stages of development.  In some instances, the remedy has been completed, while in others, environmental studies are underway or commencing.  For several sites, there are other potentially responsible parties that may be jointly or severally liable to pay all or part of cleanup costs.  While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings, based upon the Company’s experience, current information and applicable law, the Company does not expect these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and/or liquidity.\nOn February 27, 2020, a putative class action captioned Kabak v. Becton, Dickinson and Company, et al., Civ. No. 2:20-cv-02155 (SRC) (CLW), now captioned Industriens Pensionsforsikring v. Becton, Dickinson and Company, et al., was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company and certain of its officers. The complaint, which purports to be brought on behalf of all persons (other than defendants) who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company's common stock from November 5, 2019 through February 5, 2020, asserts claims for purported violations of Sections 10 and 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and seeks, among other things, damages and costs. The complaint alleges that defendants concealed material information regarding Alaris\nTM\ninfusion pumps, including that (1) certain pumps exhibited software errors, (2) the Company was investing in remediation efforts as opposed to other enhancements and (3) the Company was thus reasonably likely to recall certain pumps and/or experience regulatory delays.  These alleged omissions, the complaint asserts, rendered certain public statements about the Company’s business, operations and prospects false or misleading, causing investors to purchase stock at an inflated price.  The plaintiff filed a second amended complaint to add certain additional factual allegations on February 3, 2021, which the Company\n69\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nmoved to dismiss on March 19, 2021. The motion to dismiss was granted and the second amended complaint was dismissed in its entirety on September 15, 2021.  The court’s order, however, gave plaintiff\nforty-five\ndays to replead, which it did on October 29, 2021.  The Company believes the allegations are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously.\nOn November 2, 2020, a civil action captioned Jankowski v. Forlenza, et al., Civ. No. 2:20-cv-15474, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey by a shareholder, Ronald Jankowski, derivatively on behalf of the Company, against its individual directors and certain of its officers.  The complaint seeks recovery for breach of fiduciary duties by directors and various officers; violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and insider trading.  In general, the complaint alleges, among other things, that various directors and/or officers (1) caused the Company to issue purportedly misleading statements and SEC filings regarding Alaris\nTM\ninfusion pumps, (2) issued a misleading proxy statement, (3) engaged in improper insider trading and (4) caused or contributed to various violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including sections 10(b), 14(a) and 21D.  The complaint seeks damages, including restitution and disgorgement of profits, and an injunction requiring the Company to undertake remedial measures with respect to certain corporate governance and internal procedures.  A second derivative action, Schranz v. Polen, et al., Civ. No 2:21-cv-01081, was filed on January 24, 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and the two actions were consolidated.  In March 2021, the Company received letters from two additional shareholders which, in general, mirrored the allegations in the Jankowski and Schranz consolidated actions, and demanded, among other things, that the Board of Directors pursue civil action against members of management for claimed breaches of fiduciary duties. Consistent with New Jersey law, the Board appointed a special committee to review the allegations and demands in the derivative actions and demand letters.  Following an investigation, the special committee determined that no action was warranted, and rejected the shareholders’ demands.  The special committee’s determination has been communicated to counsel for the shareholders.  Should the shareholders continue to pursue their claims in court, the Company will take appropriate steps to seek dismissal of the complaints.\nIn February 2021, the Company received a subpoena from the Enforcement Division of the SEC requesting information from the Company relating to, among other things, Alaris\nTM\ninfusion pumps.  The Company is cooperating with the SEC and responding to these requests.  The Company cannot anticipate the timing, scope, outcome or possible impact of the investigation, financial or otherwise.\nIn April 2019, the Department of Justice served the Company and CareFusion with CIDs seeking information regarding certain of CareFusion’s contracts with the Department of Veteran’s Affairs for certain products, including Alaris\nTM\nand Pyxis\nTM\ndevices, in connection with a civil investigation of possible violations of the False Claims Act, and the government recently expanded the investigation to include several additional contracts.  The government has made several requests for documents and interviews or depositions of Company personnel.  The Company is cooperating with the government and responding to these requests.\nIn September 2021, the Company received a CID related to an inquiry initiated by the Northern District of Georgia in 2018.  The requests concern sales and marketing practices with respect to certain aspects of the Company’s urology business.  The government has made requests for documents and has interviewed employees.  The inquiry is ongoing and the Company is cooperating with the government and responding to its requests.\nIn September 2021, the Company was served with a complaint from the New Mexico Attorney General, alleging violations of the state’s consumer protection laws in connection with the sales and marketing of its IVC filters.  The Company is preparing its initial response and intends to vigorously defend itself in the litigation.  As the case is in its early stages, the Company cannot anticipate the timing, scope, outcome or possible impact at present.\nThe Company cannot predict the outcome of these matters, nor can it predict whether any outcome will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.  Accordingly, the Company has made no provisions for these other legal matters in its consolidated results of operations.\n70\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nIn July 2021, the Company became aware of lawsuits that had been filed against it in state and federal court in Georgia.  The suits were filed by plaintiffs who reside near Company facilities in Covington, GA, where ethylene oxide (“EtO”) sterilization activities take place and currently number approximately\n160\n.  The claims allege a variety of injuries, including but not limited to multiple types of cancer, allegedly attributable to exposure to EtO in the ambient air.  The Company has meritorious defenses and intends to defend itself vigorously.\nThe Company is also involved both as a plaintiff and a defendant in other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.  The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to these suits pending against the Company and is engaged in a vigorous defense of each of these matters.\nLitigation Accruals\nThe Company regularly monitors and evaluates the status of product liability and other legal matters, and may, from time-to-time, engage in settlement and mediation discussions taking into consideration developments in the matters and the risks and uncertainties surrounding litigation.  These discussions could result in settlements of one or more of these claims at any time.\nDuring fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company recorded pre-tax charges to\nOther operating expense, net\n, of approximately $\n361\nmillion, $\n378\nmillion, and $\n914\nmillion, respectively, related to certain of the product liability matters discussed above under the heading “Product Liability Matters,” including the related legal defense costs.  The Company recorded these charges based on additional information obtained during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 including but not limited to: the nature and quantity of unfiled and filed claims and the continued rate of claims being filed in certain product liability matters; the status of certain settlement discussions with plaintiffs’ counsel; the allegations and documentation supporting or refuting such allegations; publicly available information regarding similar medical device mass tort settlements; historical information regarding other product liability settlements involving the Company and the stage of litigation.\nAccruals for the Company's product liability claims which are discussed above, as well as the related legal defense costs, amounted to approximately $\n2.5\nbillion at September 30, 2021 and 2020.  These accruals, which are generally long-term in nature, are largely recorded within\nDeferred Income Taxes and Other Liabilities\non the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had $\n106\nmillion and $\n92\nmillion, respectively, in qualified settlement funds (“QSFs”), subject to certain settlement conditions, for certain product liability matters.  Payments to QSFs are recorded as a component of\nRestricted cash\n.  The Company's expected recoveries related to product liability claims and related legal defense costs were approximately $\n93\nmillion and $\n139\nmillion at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The expected recoveries at September 30, 2021 related entirely to the Company’s agreements with Medtronic related to certain Women’s Health Product Claims.  A substantial amount of the expected recoveries at September 30, 2020 related to the Company’s agreements with Medtronic related to certain Women’s Health Product Claims.  The expected recoveries at September 30, 2021 related to the indemnification obligation are not in dispute with respect to claims that Medtronic settles pursuant to the agreements.\nNote 6 —\nRevenues\nAs previously discussed in Note 2, the Company adopted ASC 606 in fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective method.  The Company sells a broad range of medical supplies, devices, laboratory equipment and diagnostic products which are distributed through independent distribution channels and directly by BD through sales representatives.  End-users of the Company's products include healthcare institutions, physicians, life science researchers, clinical laboratories, the pharmaceutical industry and the general public.\nTiming of Revenue Recognition\nThe Company's revenues are primarily recognized when the customer obtains control of the product sold, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms specified in the sales agreement.  Revenues associated with certain instruments and equipment for which installation is complex, and therefore\n71\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nsignificantly affects the customer’s ability to use and benefit from the product, are recognized when customer acceptance of these installed products has been confirmed.  For certain service arrangements, including extended warranty and software maintenance contracts, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term.  The majority of revenues relating to extended warranty contracts associated with certain instruments and equipment is generally recognized within a few years whereas deferred revenue relating to software maintenance contracts is generally recognized over a longer period.\nMeasurement of Revenues\nThe Company acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and as such, generally records revenues on a gross basis.  Revenues exclude any taxes that the Company collects from customers and remits to tax authorities.  The Company considers its shipping and handling costs to be costs of contract fulfillment and has made the accounting policy election to record these costs within\nSelling and administrative expense\n.\nPayment terms extended to the Company's customers are based upon commercially reasonable terms for the markets in which the Company's products are sold.  Because the Company generally expects to receive payment within one year or less from when control of a product is transferred to the customer, the Company does not generally adjust its revenues for the effects of a financing component.  The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of its trade receivables.  Such estimated credit losses are determined based on historical loss experiences, customer-specific credit risk, and reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, such as country or regional risks that are not captured in the historical loss information.  Amounts are written off against the allowances for doubtful accounts when the Company determines that a customer account is uncollectable.  The allowance for doubtful accounts for trade receivables is not material to the Company's consolidated financial results.\nThe Company's gross revenues are subject to a variety of deductions which are recorded in the same period that the underlying revenues are recognized.  Such variable consideration includes rebates, sales discounts and sales returns.  Because these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations, judgment is required when determining the impact of these revenue deductions on gross revenues for a reporting period.  Rebates provided by the Company are based upon prices determined under the Company's agreements with its end-user customers.  Additional factors considered in the estimate of the Company's rebate liability include the quantification of inventory that is either in stock at or in transit to the Company's distributors, as well as the estimated lag time between the sale of product and the payment of corresponding rebates.  The Company’s rebate liability at September 30, 2021 and 2020 was $\n576\nmillion and $\n526\nmillion, respectively. The impact of other forms of variable consideration, including sales discounts and sales returns, is not material to the Company's revenues.  Additional disclosures relating to sales discounts and sales returns are provided in Note 18.\nThe Company's agreements with customers within certain organizational units including Medication Management Solutions, Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences, contain multiple performance obligations including both products and certain services noted above.  The transaction price for these agreements is allocated to each performance obligation based upon its relative standalone selling price.  Standalone selling price is the amount at which the Company would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer.  The Company generally estimates standalone selling prices using its list prices and a consideration of typical discounts offered to customers.\nEffects of Revenue Arrangements on Consolidated Balance Sheets\nDue to the nature of the majority of the Company's products and services, the Company typically does not incur costs to fulfill a contract in advance of providing the customer with goods or services.  Capitalized contract costs associated with the costs to fulfill contracts for certain products in the Medication Management Solutions organizational unit are immaterial to the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  The Company's costs to obtain contracts are comprised of sales commissions which are paid to the Company's employees or third party agents.  The majority of the sales commissions incurred by the Company relate to revenue that is\n72\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nrecognized over a period that is less than one year and as such, the Company has elected a practical expedient provided under ASC 606 to record the majority of its expense associated with sales commissions as it is incurred.  Commissions relating to revenues recognized over a period longer than one year are recorded as assets which are amortized over the period over which the revenues underlying the commissions are recognized.  Capitalized contract costs related to such commissions are immaterial to the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company records contract liabilities for unearned revenue that is allocable to performance obligations, such as extended warranty and software maintenance contracts, which are performed over time as discussed further above.  These contract liabilities are immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial results.  The Company's liability for product warranties provided under its agreements with customers is not material to its consolidated balance sheets.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe Company's obligations relative to service contracts, which are further discussed above, and pending installations of equipment, primarily in the Company's Medication Management Solutions unit, represent unsatisfied performance obligations of the Company.  The revenues under existing contracts with original expected durations of more than one year, which are attributable to products and/or services that have not yet been installed or provided, are estimated to be approximately $\n2.1\nbillion at September 30, 2021.  The Company expects to recognize the majority of this revenue over the next\nthree years\n.\nWithin the Company's Medication Management Solutions, Medication Delivery Solutions, Integrated Diagnostic Solutions, and Biosciences units, some contracts also contain minimum purchase commitments of reagents or other consumables and the future sales of these consumables represent additional unsatisfied performance obligations of the Company.  The revenue attributable to the unsatisfied minimum purchase commitment-related performance obligations, for contracts with original expected durations of more than one year, is estimated to be approximately $\n2.5\nbillion at September 30, 2021.  This revenue will be recognized over the customer relationship periods.\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nA disaggregation of the Company's revenues by segment, organizational unit and geographic region is provided in Note 7.\nNote 7 —\nSegment Data\nThe Company's organizational structure is based upon\nthree\nworldwide business segments: BD Medical (“Medical”), BD Life Sciences (“Life Sciences”) and BD Interventional (\"Interventional\").  The Company’s segments are strategic businesses that are managed separately because each one develops, manufactures and markets distinct products and services.\nMedical\nMedical produces a broad array of medical technologies and devices that are used to help improve healthcare delivery in a wide range of settings.  The primary customers served by Medical are hospitals and clinics; physicians’ office practices; consumers and retail pharmacies; governmental and nonprofit public health agencies; pharmaceutical companies; and healthcare workers.  Medical consists of the following organizational units:  Medication Delivery Solutions; Medication Management Solutions; Diabetes Care; Pharmaceutical Systems.\nLife Sciences\nLife Sciences provides products for the safe collection and transport of diagnostics specimens, and instruments and reagent systems to detect a broad range of infectious diseases, healthcare-associated infections and cancers.  In addition, Life Sciences produces research and clinical tools that facilitate the study of cells, and\n73\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nthe components of cells, to gain a better understanding of normal and disease processes.  That information is used to aid the discovery and development of new drugs and vaccines, and to improve the diagnosis and management of diseases.  The primary customers served by Life Sciences are hospitals, laboratories and clinics; blood banks; healthcare workers; public health agencies; physicians’ office practices; retail pharmacies; academic and government institutions; and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.  With the emergency use authorization approval of the BD Veritor™ At-Home COVID-19 Test, Life Sciences also serves patients directly.  Life Sciences consists of the following organizational units: Integrated Diagnostic Solutions and Biosciences.\nInterventional\nInterventional provides vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialty products that are intended, with the exception of the V. Mueller\nTM\nsurgical and laparoscopic instrumentation products, to be used once and then discarded or are either temporarily or permanently implanted.  The primary customers served by Interventional are hospitals, individual healthcare professionals, extended care facilities, alternate site facilities and patients via the segment's Homecare business.  Interventional consists of the following organizational units:  Surgery; Peripheral Intervention; Urology and Critical Care.\nAdditional Segment Information\nDistribution of products is primarily through independent distribution channels, and directly to end-users by BD and independent sales representatives.\nNo\ncustomer accounted for 10% or more of revenues in any of the three years presented.\nSegment disclosures are on a performance basis consistent with internal management reporting.  The Company evaluates performance of its business segments and allocates resources to them primarily based upon operating income, which represents revenues reduced by product costs and operating expenses.  The Company’s chief operating decision maker does not receive any asset information by business segment and, as such, the Company does not report asset information by business segment.\n74\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nFinancial information for the Company’s segments is detailed below.  The Company has no material intersegment revenues.\n75\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\n(a)\nThe amounts in 2021 and 2020 include charges of $\n56\nmillion and $\n244\nmillion, respectively, recorded to\nCost of products sold,\nrelated to the estimate of costs associated with remediation efforts for BD Alaris\nTM\ninfusion pumps in the Medication Management Solutions unit\n.\n(b)\nThe amount in 2020 included $\n41\nmillion of charges to\nCost of products sold\nto write down the value of fixed assets primarily in the Medication Delivery Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems units.\n(c)\nThe amount in 2019 included $\n75\nmillion of estimated remediation costs recorded to\nOther operating expense, net\nrelating to a recall of a product component, which generally pre-dated the Company's acquisition of CareFusion in fiscal year 2015, within the Medication Management Solutions unit's infusion systems platform.\n(d)\nThe amount in 2020 included charges of $\n57\nmillion recorded to\nCost of products sold\nto write down the carrying value of certain intangible and other assets in the Biosciences and Integrated Diagnostic Solutions units.\n(e)\nThe amount in 2019 included a charge of $\n30\nmillion recorded to\nResearch and development expense\nto write down the carrying value of certain intangible assets in the Surgery unit.\n(f)\nThe amounts in 2021, 2020 and 2019 include pre-tax charges of $\n361\nmillion, $\n378\nmillion and $\n914\nmillion, respectively, related to certain product liability matters, which is further discussed in Note 5.  The amount in 2021 also includes gains of $\n158\nmillion on sale-leaseback transactions, which are further discussed in Note 17, and $\n35\nmillion of costs incurred for consulting, legal, tax and other advisory services associated with the planned spin-off of BD's Diabetes Care business.  The 2019 amount also included the pre-tax gain recognized on the Company's sale of its Advanced Bioprocessing business of approximately $\n336\nmillion, which is further discussed in Note 10.\n76\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\n(g)\nPrimarily comprised of foreign exchange, certain general and administrative expenses and share-based compensation expense.\nGeographic Information\nThe countries in which the Company has local revenue-generating operations have been combined into the following geographic areas: the United States (including Puerto Rico); EMEA (which includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa); Greater Asia (which includes countries in Greater China, Japan, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Korea, and Australia and New Zealand); and Other, which is comprised of Latin America (which includes Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean and South America) and Canada.\nRevenues to unaffiliated customers are generally based upon the source of the product shipment.  Long-lived assets, which include net property, plant and equipment, are based upon physical location.\n(a)\nThe amounts in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 reflect the reclassifications of $\n448\nmillion and $\n478\nmillion, respectively, of revenues and $\n55\nmillion and $\n37\nmillion, respectively, of long-lived assets in the Middle East and Africa.\nNote 8 —\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company grants share-based awards under the 2004 Employee and Director Equity-Based Compensation Plan (“2004 Plan”), which provides long-term incentive compensation to employees and directors consisting of: stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), performance-based restricted stock units, time-vested restricted stock units and other stock awards.\n77\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nThe fair value of share-based payments is recognized as compensation expense in net income.  BD estimates forfeitures based on experience at the time of grant and adjusts expense to reflect actual forfeiture\ns.\nThe amounts and location of compensation cost relating to share-based payments included in the consolidated statements of income is as follows:\nUpon the Company's acquisition of Bard in 2018, certain pre-acquisition equity awards of Bard were converted into either BD SARs or BD restricted stock awards, as applicable.  These awards have substantially the same terms and conditions as the converted Bard awards immediately prior to the acquisition date.  Compensation expense of $\n16\nmillion and $\n40\nmillion associated with these replacement awards was recorded in\nAcquisitions and other restructurings\nin 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nStock Appreciation Rights\nSARs represent the right to receive, upon exercise, shares of common stock having a value equal to the difference between the market price of common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price on the date of grant.  SARs generally vest over a period of\nfour years\nand have a term of\nten years\n.\nThe fair value of awards was estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-based binomial option valuation model and these valuations were largely based upon the following weighted-average assumptions:\nExpected volatility is based upon historical volatility for the Company’s common stock and other factors. The expected life of SARs granted is derived from the output of the lattice-based model, using assumed exercise rates based on historical exercise and termination patterns, and represents the period of time that SARs granted are expected to be outstanding.  The risk-free interest rate used is based upon the published U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar life.  The dividend yield is based upon the most recently declared quarterly dividend as of the grant date.  The Company issued\n0.4\nmillion shares during 2021 to satisfy the SARs exercised.\n78\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nA summary of SARs outstanding as of September 30, 2021 and changes during the year then ended is as follows:\nA summary of SARs exercised during\n2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nPerformance-Based and Time-Vested Restricted Stock Units\nPerformance-based restricted stock units cliff vest\nthree years\nafter the date of grant.  These units are tied to the Company’s performance against pre-established targets over a performance period of\nthree years\n.  The performance measures for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were average annual currency-neutral revenue growth and average annual return on invested capital, with the combined factor subject to adjustment based on the Company's relative total shareholder return (measures the Company’s stock performance during the performance period against that of peer companies).  For fiscal year 2019, the performance measures were relative total shareholder return and average annual return on invested capital.  Under the Company’s long-term incentive program, the actual payout under these awards may vary from\nzero\nto\n200\n% of an employee’s target payout, based on the Company’s actual performance over the performance period of\nthree years\n.  In fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the Company also issued additional performance-based time-vested units to certain key executives, which cliff vest three years after the date of grant and are tied to the Company’s performance against average annual growth in the Company’s Adjusted EPS over a performance period of three years.  No shares will be issuable if the performance targets have not been met.  The fair value is based on the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant.  Compensation cost initially recognized assumes that the target payout level will be achieved and is adjusted for subsequent changes in the expected outcome of performance-related conditions.  For units for which the performance conditions are modified after the date of grant, any incremental increase in the fair value of the modified units, over the original units, is recorded as compensation expense on the date of the modification for vested units, or over the remaining performance period for units not yet vested.\nTime-vested restricted stock unit awards vest on a graded basis over a period of\nthree years\n, except for certain key executives of the Company, including the executive officers, for which such units generally vest\none year\nfollowing the employee’s retirement.  The related share-based compensation expense is recorded over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period or is based on retirement eligibility.  The fair value of all time-vested restricted stock units is based on the market value of the Company’s stock on the date of grant.\n79\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nA summary of restricted stock units outstanding as of September 30, 2021 and changes during the year then ended is as follows:\n(a)\nBased on\n200\n% of target payout for performance based restricted units and\n100\n% of the performance based time-vested units.\n(b)\nNet of expected forfeited units and units in excess of the expected performance payout of\n63\nthousand and\n555\nthousand shares, respectively.\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted during the years 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nThe total fair value of stock units vested during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\nAt September 30, 2021, the weighted average remaining vesting term of performance-based and time vested restricted stock units is\n1.27\nand\n0.89\nyears, respectively.\nUnrecognized Compensation Expense and Other Stock Plans\nThe amount of unrecognized compensation expense for all non-vested share-based awards as of September 30, 2021, is approximately $\n247\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining life of approximately\n1.94\nyears.  At September 30, 2021,\n8.6\nmillion shares were authorized for future grants under the 2004 Plan.  The Company has a policy of satisfying share-based payments through either open market purchases or shares held in treasury.  At September 30, 2021, the Company has sufficient shares held in treasury to satisfy these payments.\nAs of September 30, 2021,\n93\nthousand shares were held in trust relative to a Director's Deferral plan, which provides a means to defer director compensation, from time to time, on a deferred stock or cash basis. Also as of September 30, 2021,\n259\nthousand shares were issuable under a Deferred Compensation Plan that allows certain highly-compensated employees, including executive officers, to defer salary, annual incentive awards and certain equity-based compensation.\n80\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nNote 9 —\nBenefit Plans\nThe Company has defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees in the United States and certain international locations.  Postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefits provided to qualifying domestic retirees as well as other postretirement benefit plans in international countries are not material.  The measurement date used for the Company’s employee benefit plans is September 30.\nAs a result of the Company’s conclusion to merge the legacy Bard pension plan into the BD defined benefit cash balance pension plan, the assets and liabilities of the legacy Bard U.S. defined pension benefit plan were remeasured as of October 31, 2020.  Amendments to this plan were approved and communicated to affected employees in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.  The legacy Bard U.S. pension plan has been frozen to prevent new participants since January 1, 2011.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the legacy BD U.S. pension plan was frozen to limit the participation of employees who are hired or re-hired by the Company, or who transfer employment to the Company, on or after January 1, 2018.\nNet pension cost for the years ended September 30 included the following components:\nThe amounts provided above for amortization of prior service credit and amortization of loss represent the reclassifications of prior service credits and net actuarial losses that were recognized in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nin prior periods.  The settlement losses recorded in 2021, 2020 and 2019 included lump sum benefit payments associated with certain plans.  The Company recognizes pension settlements when payments from the plan exceed the sum of service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost associated with the plan for the fiscal year.  A curtailment loss in 2021, related to freezing a pension plan in Europe, was recorded when the loss was probable and estimable.\nAll components of the Company’s net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, aside from service cost, are recorded to\nOther (expense) income, net\non its consolidated statements of income.\n81\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nThe change in benefit obligation, change in fair value of pension plan assets, funded status and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for these plans were as follows:\nInternational pension plan assets at fair value included in the preceding table were $\n1.033\nbillion and $\n935\nmillion at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The international pension plan projected benefit obligations were $\n1.320\nbillion and $\n1.321\nbillion at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n82\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nThe benefit obligation associated with postretirement healthcare and life insurance plans provided to qualifying domestic retirees, which was largely recorded to\nLong-Term Employee Benefit Obligations,\nwas $\n138\nmillion and $\n148\nmillion at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nPension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets and plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets consist of the following at September 30:\nThe weighted average assumptions used in determining pension plan information were as follows:\n(a)\nThe Company calculated the service and interest components utilizing an approach that discounts the individual expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from the yield curve over the projected cash flow period.\n83\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nExpected Rate of Return on Plan Assets\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets is based upon expectations of long-term average rates of return to be achieved by the underlying investment portfolios.  In establishing this assumption, the Company considers many factors, including historical assumptions compared with actual results; benchmark data; expected returns on various plan asset classes, as well as current and expected asset allocations.\nExpected Funding\nThe Company’s funding policy for its defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet legal funding requirements, plus any additional amounts that may be appropriate considering the funded status of the plans, tax consequences, the cash flow generated by the Company and other factors.  The Company made discretionary contributions to its BD U.S. pension plan of $\n16\nmillion during fiscal year 2021 and $\n134\nmillion in October 2021. The Company did not make any required contributions in 2021 and does not anticipate any significant required contributions to its pension plans in 2022.\nExpected benefit payments are as follows:\nExpected benefit payments associated with postretirement healthcare plans are immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial results.\nInvestments\nThe Company’s primary objective is to achieve returns sufficient to meet future benefit obligations.  It seeks to generate above market returns by investing in more volatile asset classes such as equities while at the same time controlling risk through diversification in non-correlated asset classes and through allocations to more stable asset classes like fixed income.\nU.S. Plans\nThe Company’s U.S. pension plans comprise\n68\n% of total benefit plan investments, based on September 30, 2021 market values, and have a target asset mix of\n45\n% fixed income,\n23\n% diversifying investments and\n32\n% equities.  This mix was established based on an analysis of projected benefit payments and estimates of long-term returns, volatilities and correlations for various asset classes.  The asset allocations to diversifying investments include high-yield bonds, hedge funds, real estate, infrastructure, leveraged loans and emerging markets bonds.\nThe actual portfolio investment mix may, from time to time, deviate from the established target mix due to various factors such as normal market fluctuations, the reliance on estimates in connection with the determination of allocations and normal portfolio activity such as additions and withdrawals.  Rebalancing of the asset portfolio on a quarterly basis is required to address any allocations that deviate from the established target allocations in excess of defined allowable ranges.  The target allocations are subject to periodic review, including a review of the asset portfolio’s performance, by the named fiduciary of the plans.  Any tactical deviations from the established asset mix require the approval of the named fiduciary.\nThe U.S. plans may enter into both exchange traded and non-exchange traded derivative transactions in order to manage interest rate exposure, volatility, term structure of interest rates, and sector and currency\n84\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nexposures within the fixed income portfolios.  The Company has established minimum credit quality standards for counterparties in such transactions.\nThe following table provides the fair value measurements of U.S. plan assets, as well as the measurement techniques and inputs utilized to measure fair value of these assets, at September 30, 2021 and 2020.  The categorization of fund investments is based upon the categorization of these funds’ underlying assets.\n(a)\nAs per applicable disclosure requirements, certain investments that were measured at net asset value per share or its equivalent have not been categorized within the fair value hierarchy.  Values of such assets are based on the corroborated net asset value provided by the fund administrator.\nFixed Income Securities\nU.S. pension plan assets categorized above as fixed income securities include fund investments comprised of corporate and government and agency investments. Investments in corporate bonds are diversified across industry and sector and consist of investment-grade, as well as high-yield debt instruments.  U.S. government investments consist of obligations of the U.S. Treasury, other U.S. government agencies, state governments and local municipalities.  Assets categorized as foreign government and agency debt securities included investments in developed and emerging markets.\nThe values of fixed income investments classified within Level 1 are based on the closing price reported on the major market on which the investments are traded. A portion of the fixed income instruments classified within Level 2 are valued based upon estimated prices from independent vendors’ pricing models and these prices are derived from market observable sources including: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other market-related data.\nEquity Securities\nU.S. pension plan assets categorized as equity securities consist of fund investments in publicly-traded U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities.  In order to achieve appropriate diversification, these portfolios are invested across market sectors, investment styles, capitalization weights and geographic regions.  The values of equity securities classified within Level 1 are based on the closing price reported on the major market on which the\n85\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\ninvestments are traded or have a readily determinable fair value based on published prices obtained from fund managers which represent the price at which the instruments can be redeemed at period end. The U.S. pension plan has no future funding commitments associated with these investments and has the right to redeem them upon one day’s notice, at any time and without restriction.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nA portion of the U.S. plans’ assets consists of investments in cash and cash equivalents, primarily to accommodate liquidity requirements relating to trade settlement and benefit payment activity, and the values of these assets are based upon quoted market prices.\nOther Securities\nOther U.S. pension plan assets include fund investments comprised of hedge funds.  The values of such instruments classified within Level 1 are based on the closing price reported on the major market on which the investments are traded.\nInternational Plans\nInternational plan assets comprise\n32\n% of the Company’s total benefit plan assets, based on market value at September 30, 2021.  Such plans have local independent fiduciary committees, with responsibility for development and oversight of investment policy, including asset allocation decisions.  In making such decisions, consideration is given to local regulations, investment practices and funding rules.\nThe following table provides the fair value measurements of international plan assets, as well as the measurement techniques and inputs utilized to measure fair value of these assets, at September 30, 2021 and 2020.\n86\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\n(a)\nChanges in the fair value of international pension assets measured using Level 3 inputs for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 were immaterial.\nFixed Income Securities\nFixed income investments held by international pension plans include corporate, U.S. government and non-U.S. government securities.  The values of fixed income securities classified within Level 1 are based on the closing price reported on the major market on which the investments are traded.  Values of investments classified within Level 2 are based upon estimated prices from independent vendors’ pricing models and these prices are derived from market observable sources.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities included in the international plan assets consist of publicly-traded U.S. and non-U.S. equity securities.  The values of equity securities classified within Level 1 are based on the closing price reported on the major market on which the investments are traded or have a readily determinable fair value based on published prices obtained from fund managers which represent the price at which the instruments can be redeemed at period end.  The international plans holding these securities have no future funding commitments associated with these investments and has the right to redeem them upon one day’s notice, at any time and without restriction.\nOther Securities\nThe international plans hold a portion of assets in cash and cash equivalents, in order to accommodate liquidity requirements and the values are based upon quoted market prices.  Real estate investments consist of investments in funds holding an interest in real properties and the corresponding values represent the estimated fair value based on the fair value of the underlying investment value or cost, adjusted for any accumulated earnings or losses.  The values of insurance contracts approximately represent cash surrender value.  Other investments include fund investments for which values are based upon either quoted market prices or market observable sources.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe cost of voluntary defined contribution plans which provide for a Company match or contribution was $\n153\nmillion in 2021, $\n111\nmillion in 2020 and $\n126\nmillion in 2019.  As a short term measure to preserve cash and reduce costs, the Company's matching contributions were temporarily suspended effective May 1, 2020 and matching contributions were reinstated in October 2020.\nNote 10 —\nDivestitures\nIn October 2018, the Company completed the sale of its Life Sciences segment's Advanced Bioprocessing business.  The Company recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $\n336\nmillion which was recorded as a component of\nOther operating expense, net\nin fiscal year 2019.\n87\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nNote 11 —\nBusiness Restructuring Charges\nIn connection with the Company's 2018 acquisition of Bard, and simplification and other cost saving initiatives, the Company incurred restructuring costs which were largely recorded within\nAcquisitions and other restructurings\non its consolidated statements of income.  The simplification and other costs saving initiatives are focused on reducing complexity, enhancing product quality, refining customer experience, and improving cost efficiency across all of the Company’s segments.\nRestructuring liability activity in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\n(a)\nRestructuring costs in 2021, 2020 and 2019 included expenses primarily related to simplification and other cost saving initiatives.\n(b)\nExpenses in 2020 and 2019 largely represented the costs associated with the conversion of certain pre-acquisition equity awards of Bard which, to encourage post-acquisition employee retention, were converted to BD equity awards with substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Bard awards immediately prior to the acquisition date.\n88\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nNote 12 —\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets at September 30 consisted of:\nIntangible amortization expense was $\n1.403\nbillion, $\n1.384\nbillion and $\n1.497\nbillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The estimated aggregate amortization expense for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2022 to 2026 are as follows: 2022 — $\n1.399\nbillion; 2023 — $\n1.386\nbillion; 2024 — $\n1.384\nbillion; 2025 — $\n1.383\nbillion; 2026 — $\n1.357\nbillion.\nThe following is a reconciliation of goodwill by business segment:\n(a)\nRepresents goodwill recognized relative to certain acquisitions which were not material individually or in the aggregate.\nNote 13 —\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate certain exposures.  The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.  The effects these derivative instruments and hedged items had on the Company’s balance sheets and the fair values of the derivatives outstanding at September 30, 2021 and 2020 were not material.  The effects on the Company’s financial performance and cash flows are provided below.\n89\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nForeign Currency Risks and Related Strategies\nThe Company has foreign currency exposures throughout Europe, Greater Asia, Canada and Latin America. Transactional currency exposures that arise from entering into transactions, generally on an intercompany basis, in non-hyperinflationary countries that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are mitigated primarily through the use of forward contracts.  In order to mitigate foreign currency exposure relating to its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, the Company has hedged the currency risk associated with those investments with certain instruments such as foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps, which are designated as net investment hedges, as well as currency exchange contracts.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s foreign currency-related derivative instruments as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n(a)\nRepresent hedges of transactional foreign exchange exposures resulting primarily from intercompany payables and receivables.  Gains and losses on these instruments are recognized immediately in income.  These gains and losses are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying hedged items, as well as the hedging costs associated with the derivative instruments.  Net amounts recognized in\nOther (expense) income, net\n, during the years ending September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are detailed in Note 18.\n(b)\nRepresents foreign currency-denominated long-term notes outstanding which were effective as economic hedges of net investments in certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.\n(c)\nRepresents cross-currency swaps which were effective as economic hedges of net investments in certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries.\nNet gains or losses relating to the net investment hedges, which are attributable to changes in the foreign currencies to U.S. dollar spot exchange rates, are recorded as accumulated foreign currency translation in\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n.  Upon the termination of a net investment hedge, any net gain or loss included in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nrelative to the investment hedge remains until the foreign subsidiary investment is disposed of or is substantially liquidated.\nNet gains (losses) recorded to\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nrelating to the Company's net investment hedges as of September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n(a)\nThe amount in 2021 includes a loss of $\n35\nmillion recognized on terminated cross-currency swaps.\n(b)\nThe amount in 2019 represented a loss recognized on a forward contract which was entered into and terminated in fiscal year 2019.\nInterest Rate Risks and Related Strategies\nThe Company uses a mix of fixed and variable rate debt, which is further discussed in Note 15, to manage its interest rate exposure, and periodically uses interest rate swaps to manage such exposures.  Under these interest rate swaps, the Company exchanges, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating\n90\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\ninterest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.  These swaps are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\nChanges in the fair value of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges (i.e., hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk) are recorded in\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n.  If interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are terminated, the balance in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nattributable to those derivatives is reclassified into earnings over the remaining life of the hedged debt.  The net realized loss related to terminated interest rate swaps expected to be reclassified and recorded in\nInterest expense\nwithin the next 12 months is $\n1\nmillion, net of tax.  The amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income relating to cash flow hedges during 2021, 2020 and 2019 were not material to the Company's consolidated financial results.\nThe Company recorded net after-tax gains (losses) of $\n72\nmillion and $(\n75\n) million in\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nrelating to interest rate-related cash flow hedges during the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The amounts recognized in other comprehensive income relating to interest rate hedges during the year ended 2019 were immaterial.\nFor interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges (i.e., hedges against the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk), changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps offset changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to changes in market interest rates.  The amounts recorded during the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 for changes in the fair value of these hedges were immaterial to the Company's consolidated financial results.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s interest rate-related derivative instruments as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n(a)\nRepresents fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements the Company entered into to convert the interest payments on certain long-term notes from the fixed rate to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR.  In fiscal year 2021, certain interest rate swaps were terminated at an immaterial net gain, concurrently with the redemption of the\n3.125\n% notes due November 8, 2021.\n(b)\nRepresents interest rate derivatives entered into to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk related to future debt issuances.  Concurrently with the issuance of senior unsecured U.S. notes in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, the notional amount of $\n500\nmillion of the Company's outstanding forward starting interest rate swaps were terminated at an immaterial net loss.\nOther Risk Exposures\nThe Company purchases resins, which are oil-based components used in the manufacture of certain products.  Significant increases in world oil prices that lead to increases in resin purchase costs could impact future operating results.  From time to time, the Company has managed price risks associated with these commodity purchases through commodity derivative forward contracts.  The Company had\nno\noutstanding commodity derivative forward contracts at September 30, 2021 and 2020.\nNote 14 —\nFinancial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\nThe following reconciles cash and equivalents and restricted cash reported within the Company's consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2021 and 2020 to the total of these amounts shown on the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows:\n91\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nThe fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:\n(a)\nThese financial instruments are recorded within\nCash and equivalents\non the consolidated balance sheets.  The institutional money market accounts permit daily redemption.  Remaining cash and equivalents, excluding restricted cash, were $\n2.083\nbillion and $\n1.276\nbillion at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(b)\nLong-term debt is recorded at amortized cost.  The fair value of long-term debt is measured based upon quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments\nShort-term investments are held to their maturities and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.  The short-term investments consist of instruments with maturities greater than\nthree months\nand less than\none year\n.  All other instruments measured by the Company at fair value, including derivatives and contingent consideration liabilities, are immaterial to the Company's consolidated balance sheets.\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\nIn fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded charges to\nCost of products sold\nof $\n49\nmillion to write down the carrying value of certain fixed assets.  In fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded charges to\nCost of products sold\nof $\n57\nmillion to write down the carrying values of certain intangible and other assets in the Biosciences and Integrated Diagnostic Solutions units, and $\n41\nmillion to write down the value of fixed assets primarily in the Medication Delivery Solutions and Pharmaceutical Systems units.  In fiscal year 2019, the Company recorded a charge to\nResearch and development expense\nof $\n30\nmillion to write down the carrying values of certain intangible assets in the Surgery unit.  The amounts recognized in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were recorded to adjust the carrying amount of assets to the assets' fair values, which were estimated, based upon a market participant's perspective, using Level 3 inputs, including values estimated using the income approach.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company maintains cash deposits in excess of government-provided insurance limits.  Such cash deposits are exposed to loss in the event of nonperformance by financial institutions.  Substantially all of the Company’s trade receivables are due from public and private entities involved in the healthcare industry.  Due to the large size and diversity of the Company’s customer base, concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited.  The Company does not normally require collateral.  The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by financial institutions with which it conducts business.  However, this loss is limited to the amounts, if any, by which the obligations of the counterparty to the financial instrument contract exceed the obligations of the Company.  The Company also minimizes exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions.\nThe Company continually evaluates its accounts receivables for potential collection risks particularly those resulting from sales to government-owned or government-supported healthcare facilities in certain countries as payment may be dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of those countries’ national economies.  The Company continually evaluates all governmental receivables for potential collection risks associated with the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices.  The Company\n92\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nbelieves the current reserves related to all governmental receivables are adequate and that this concentration of credit risk will not have a material adverse impact on its financial position or liquidity.\nTransfers of trade receivables\nOver the normal course of its business activities, the Company transfers certain trade receivable assets to third parties under factoring agreements.  Per the terms of these agreements, the Company surrenders control over its trade receivables upon transfer.  Accordingly, the Company accounts for the transfers as sales of trade receivables by recognizing an increase to\nCash and equivalents\nand a decrease to\nTrade receivables, net\nwhen proceeds from the transactions are received.  The costs incurred by the Company in connection with factoring activities were not material to its consolidated financial results.\nThe amounts transferred and yet to be remitted under factoring arrangements in 2021 and 2020 are provided below.  The Company’s transfers of trade receivables during fiscal year 2019 were not material to its consolidated financial results.\nNote 15 —\nDebt\nShort-term debt\nThe carrying value of\nShort-term debt\n, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, at September 30 consisted of:\n(a)\nAll of the aggregate principal amount outstanding was retired during 2021, as further discussed below.\nThe weighted average interest rates for short-term debt were\n1.15\n% and\n0.20\n% at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n93\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nLong-term debt\nThe carrying value of\nLong-Term Debt\n, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, at September 30 consisted of:\n(a)\nAll or a portion of the aggregate principal amount outstanding was retired during 2021, as further discussed below.\n(b)\nRepresents notes issued during 2021, as further discussed below.\nThe aggregate annual maturities of\nLong-Term Debt\nincluding interest during the fiscal years ending September 30, 2022 to 2026 are as follows: 2022 — $\n433\nmillion; 2023 — $\n2.749\nbillion; 2024 — $\n1.559\nbillion; 2025 — $\n2.164\nbillion; 2026 — $\n1.053\nbillion.\n94\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nOther current credit facilities\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company refinanced its\nfive-year\nsenior unsecured revolving credit facility that was to expire in December 2022, with a new\nfive-year\nsenior unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire in September 2026.  The credit facility provides borrowings of up to $\n2.75\nbillion, with separate sub-limits of $\n100\nmillion for letters of credit and swingline loans.  The expiration date of the credit facility may be extended for up to two additional one year periods, subject to certain restrictions (including the consent of the lenders). The credit facility provides that the Company may, subject to additional commitments by lenders, request an additional $\n500\nmillion of financing, for a maximum aggregate commitment under the credit facility of up to $\n3.25\nbillion. Proceeds from this facility may be used for general corporate purposes. There were\nno\nborrowings outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit facilities as of September 30, 2021 and 2020.  In addition, the Company has informal lines of credit outside of the United States.\nThe Company had\nno\ncommercial paper borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2021.\nDebt issuances\nThe Company issued the following U.S. dollar-denominated debt during fiscal years 2021 and 2020:\nThe Company issued the following Euro-denominated debt during fiscal year 2021:\nAlso in fiscal year 2021, Becton Dickinson Euro Finance S.à r.l., a private limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée), which is an indirect, wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the Company, issued Euro-denominated notes, listed below, which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company.  No other of the Company's subsidiaries provide any guarantees with respect to these notes.  The indenture covenants included a limitation on liens and a restriction on sale and leasebacks, change of control and consolidation, merger and sale of assets covenants.  These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, limitations and qualifications.  The indenture does not restrict the Company, Becton Dickinson Euro Finance S.à r.l., or any other of the Company's subsidiaries from incurring additional debt or other liabilities, including additional senior debt.  Additionally, the indenture does not restrict Becton Dickinson Euro Finance S.à r.l. and the Company from granting security interests over its assets.\nThe notes issued by Becton Dickinson Euro Finance S.à r.l included the following:\n95\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nDebt retirements\nThe Company’s retirements of debt in fiscal year 2021 included the following:\n(a)\nIncluded accrued interest, related premiums, fees and expenses.\n(b)\nAll debt retirements in fiscal year 2021 were accounted for as early debt extinguishments.\nThe Company’s retirements of debt in fiscal year 2020 included the following:\n(a)\nIncluded accrued interest, related premiums, fees and expenses.\n(b)\nDebt retirement was accounted for as an early debt extinguishment.\n96\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nIn March 2020, the Company entered into a\n364\n-day senior unsecured term loan facility with borrowing capacity available of $\n2.0\nbillion.  During the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company repaid $\n1.9\nbillion of borrowings outstanding under this term loan with cash on hand and terminated the facility.\nCapitalized interest\nThe Company capitalizes interest costs as a component of the cost of construction in progress.\nA summary of interest costs and payments for the years ended September 30 is as follows:\nNote 16 —\nIncome Taxes\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes the years ended September 30 consisted of:\nThe components of\nIncome Before Income Taxes\nfor the years ended September 30 consisted of:\nU.S. tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\"), was enacted on December 22, 2017.  The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from\n35\n% to\n21\n%, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings.  The Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") earned by certain foreign subsidiaries.  The Company has elected to account for its GILTI tax due as a period expense in the year the tax is incurred.\nDuring fiscal year 2019, the Company finalized its accounting for the income tax effects of the Act and recognized additional tax benefit of $\n50\nmillion in 2019 as a result of this legislation within\nIncome tax provision (benefit)\n.  During fiscal year 2019, the Company also changed its assertion with respect to historical unremitted foreign earnings, which  resulted in a total tax benefit of $\n138\nmillion, of which $\n67\nmillion is related to the tax legislation benefit previously recorded, and is included as a component of\nIncome tax provision (benefit)\nin fiscal 2019. The Company asserts indefinite reinvestment for all historical unremitted foreign earnings as of September 30, 2021.\n97\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe table below summarizes the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits without regard to reduction in tax liabilities or additions to deferred tax assets and liabilities if such unrecognized tax benefits were settled. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized benefits will change due to one or more of the following events in the next twelve months: expiring statutes, audit activity, tax payments, other activity, or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate.\nUpon the Company's acquisition of CareFusion in 2015, the Company became a party to a tax matters agreement with Cardinal Health resulting from Cardinal Health's spin-off of CareFusion in fiscal year 2010.  Under the tax matters agreement, the Company is obligated to indemnify Cardinal Health for certain tax exposures and transaction taxes prior to CareFusion’s spin-off from Cardinal Health.  The indemnification payable is approximately $\n119\nmillion at September 30, 2021 and is included in\nDeferred Income Taxes and Other Liabilities\non the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe following were included for the years ended September 30 as a component of\nIncome tax provision (benefit)\non the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions.  The IRS has completed its audit for the BD legacy fiscal year 2014, BD combined company fiscal years 2015 and 2017 and CareFusion legacy fiscal years 2010 through short period 2015.  With regard to Bard, all examinations have been completed through calendar year 2014, and calendar years 2015 through short period 2017 are currently under examination by the IRS.  For the other major tax jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, tax years are generally open after 2012.\n98\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes at September 30 consisted of:\n(a)\nNet deferred tax assets are included in\nOther Assets\nand net deferred tax liabilities are included in\nDeferred Income Taxes and Other Liabilities\non the consolidated balance sheets\n.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are netted on the balance sheet by separate tax jurisdictions.  Deferred taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of September 30, 2021 since the determination of the total amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable.\nGenerally, deferred tax assets have been established as a result of net operating losses and credit carryforwards with expiration dates from 2022 to an unlimited expiration date.  Valuation allowances have been established as a result of an evaluation of the uncertainty associated with the realization of certain deferred tax assets on these losses and credit carryforwards.  The valuation allowance at September 30, 2021 is primarily the result of foreign losses due to the Company’s global re-organization of its foreign entities and these generally have no expiration date.  Valuation allowances are also maintained with respect to deferred tax assets for certain federal and state carryforwards that may not be realized and that principally expire in 2022.\nTax Rate Reconciliation\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory tax rate to the Company’s effective income tax rate was as follows:\nThe fluctuations in the Company’s reported tax rates are primarily due to the geographical mix of income attributable to foreign countries that have income tax rates that vary from the U.S. tax rate, and to the Act, the effects of which were recorded in fiscal year 2019.\n99\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nTax Holidays and Payments\nThe approximate tax impacts related to tax holidays in various countries in which the Company does business are provided below. The tax holidays expire at various dates through 2028.  The Company’s income tax payments, net of refunds are also provided below.\nNote 17 —\nLeases\nThe Company leases real estate, vehicles and other equipment which are used in the Company’s manufacturing, administrative and research and development activities.\nThe Company identifies a contract that contains a lease as one which conveys a right, either explicitly or implicitly, to control the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration.  The Company’s lease arrangements are generally classified as operating leases.  These arrangements have remaining terms ranging from less than\none year\nto approximately\n25\nyears and the weighted-average remaining lease term of the Company’s leases is approximately\n6.9\nyears.  An option to renew or terminate the current term of a lease arrangement is included in the lease term if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option.\nThe Company does not recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for short-term leases, which have terms of 12 months or less, on its consolidated balance sheet.\nFor the longer-term lease arrangements that are recognized on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, the right-of-use asset and lease liability is initially measured at the commencement date based upon the present value of the lease payments due under the lease.  These payments represent the combination of the fixed lease and fixed non-lease components that are due under the arrangement.\nThe costs associated with the Company’s short-term leases, as well as variable costs relating to the Company’s lease arrangements, are not material to its consolidated financial results.\nThe implicit interest rates of the Company’s lease arrangements are generally not readily determinable and as such, the Company applies an incremental borrowing rate, which is established based upon the information available at the lease commencement date, to determine the present value of lease payments due under an arrangement.  The weighted-average incremental borrowing rate that has been applied to measure the Company’s lease liabilities is\n2.2\n%.\nThe Company’s lease costs recorded in its consolidated statements of income for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 were $\n132\nmillion and $\n131\nmillion, respectively, under the new lease accounting standard.  Rental expense for all operating leases amounted to $\n169\nmillion in 2019 under the previous accounting standard.  Cash payments arising from the Company’s lease arrangements are reflected on its consolidated statement of cash flows as outflows used for operating activities.\nThe right-of-use assets and lease liabilities recognized on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n100\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\nThe Company’s payments due under its operating leases are as follows:\nSale-Leaseback Transactions\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company sold certain properties and concurrently entered into operating lease arrangements for each property, which met the requirements for sale-leaseback accounting.  The Company recorded gross proceeds of $\n225\nmillion related to the transactions and pre-tax gains of $\n158\nmillion were recorded in\nOther operating expense.\nThe lease agreements have initial lease terms between\ntwo\nand\nthree years\nand include options for the Company to extend the leases for an additional\nsix\n-to-\ntwelve\nmonths.\nNote 18 —\nSupplemental Financial Information\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n(a)\nThe amounts include gains (losses) recognized on changes to the fair value of certain equity investments.  The amount in 2020 also includes a gain on the sale of an equity investment.\n(b)\nRepresents all components of the Company’s net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs, aside from service cost.\n(c)\nRepresents losses recognized upon the extinguishment of certain senior notes, as further discussed in Note 15.\n(d)\nThe amount in 2020 primarily represents licensing income.  The amount in 2019 primarily represents the royalty income stream acquired in the Bard transaction, net of non-cash purchase accounting amortization.  The royalty income stream was previously reported by Bard as revenues.\nTrade Receivables, Net\nThe amounts recognized in 2021, 2020 and 2019 relating to allowances for doubtful accounts and cash discounts, which are netted against trade receivables, are provided in the following table:\n101\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)\nBecton, Dickinson and Company\n(a)\nAccounts written off.\nInventories\nInventories at September 30 consisted of:\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net at September 30 consisted of:"
