The AIDC market consists of mobile computing, data capture, radio frequency identification devices (“RFID”), barcode printing, and other automation products and services. The Company’s solutions are proven to help our customers and end-users achieve their critical business objectives, including improved operational efficiency, optimized workflows, increased asset utilization, improved regulatory compliance, and better customer experiences.\nWe design, manufacture, and sell a broad range of AIDC products, including: mobile computers, barcode scanners and imagers, RFID readers, specialty printers for barcode labeling and personal identification, real-time location systems (“RTLS”), related accessories and supplies, such as labels and other consumables, and software applications. We also provide a full range of services, including maintenance, technical support, repair, managed and professional services, as well as cloud-based subscriptions. End-users of our products, solutions and services include retail and e-commerce, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, hospitality, warehouse and distribution, energy and utilities, government, public safety, education, and banking enterprises around the world. We provide our products, solutions and services globally through a direct sales force\n4\nand extensive network of approximately 10,000 channel partners. We provide products, solutions and services in approximately 180 countries, with 128 facilities and approximately 8,800 employees worldwide.\nThrough innovative application of our technologies, we are leading an evolution of the traditional AIDC market into EAI, which encompasses solutions that sense information from enterprise assets, including packages moving through a supply chain, equipment in a factory, workers in a warehouse, and shoppers in a store. Data from enterprise assets, including status, location, utilization, and preferences, is then analyzed to provide actionable insights. Finally, with the benefits of mobility, these insights can be delivered to the right user at the right time to drive more effective actions. As a result, our solutions and technologies enable enterprises to “sense, analyze, and act” more effectively to improve operational effectiveness and achieve critical business objectives.\nThe evolution of the AIDC market is being driven by strong underlying secular trends in technology. These trends include the internet of things (\n“IoT”\n), cloud-based data analytics, mobility, as well as artificial intelligence and automation. The IoT enables an exchange of information among a proliferation of smart, connected devices. Newer solutions, which include these smart, connected devices, capture a much broader range of information than is possible with traditional AIDC solutions and communicate this information in real-time. Cloud computing and expanded data analytics are allowing enterprises to make better business decisions through improved timeliness and visibility to information and workflows. While traditional AIDC solutions sporadically capture limited amounts of data and populate static enterprise systems, EAI solutions continuously analyze real-time data from many sources to generate actionable insights. The continued rapid growth of mobile devices and application software are also significantly expanding mobile computing use cases in the enterprise. With this expanded mobility, end-users can consume or act upon dynamic enterprise data and information anytime and anywhere. Computer vision solutions, which enable the automatic extraction and understanding of useful information from a digital image or video, are also driving the expansion of intelligent automation, which leverages our sense-analyze-act framework to improve workflows with or without a human operator.\nAcquisitions\nReflexis:\nOn September 1, 2020, the Company acquired Reflexis Systems, Inc.

These risks are not the only risks we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial. No priority or significance is intended by, nor should be attached to, the order in which the risk factors appear.\nGeneral Business and Industry Risks\nThe Company is vulnerable to the potential difficulties associated with the increase in the complexity of our business\n. We have grown rapidly over the last several years through acquisition and worldwide growth. This growth has caused increased complexities in the business. We believe our future success depends in part on our ability to manage our growth and increased complexities of our business. The following factors could present difficulties to us:\n•\nManaging our distribution channel partners;\n•\nManaging our contract manufacturing and supply chain;\n•\nManufacturing an increased number of products;\n•\nDeveloping and managing custom solutions offerings;\n•\nManaging parties to whom we have outsourced portions of our business operations;\n•\nManaging administrative and operational burdens;\n•\nManaging stakeholder interests including customer, investor and employee social responsibility matters;\n•\nMaintaining and improving information technology infrastructure to support growth;\n•\nManaging the integration of acquisitions;\n•\nManaging logistical problems common to complex, expansive operations;\n•\nManaging our international operations; and\n•\nAttracting, developing and retaining individuals with the requisite technical expertise to develop new technologies and introduce new products and solutions.\nInability to consummate future acquisitions at appropriate prices could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price.\nOur ability to expand revenues, earnings, and cash flow depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and to realize anticipated synergies. Acquisitions can be difficult to identify and consummate due to competition among prospective buyers and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain antitrust and other regulatory approval on acceptable terms.\nThe Company could encounter difficulties in any acquisition it undertakes, including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption. Acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affect operating results.\nWe may acquire or make investments in other businesses, technologies, services, products, or solutions. An acquisition may present business issues which are new to us. The process of integrating any acquired business, technology, service, or product into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Integration of an acquired company also may consume considerable management time and attention, which could otherwise be available for ongoing operations and the further development of our existing business. These and other factors may result in benefits of an acquisition not being fully realized.\nAcquisitions also may involve a number of risks, including:\n•\nDifficulties and uncertainties in retaining the customers or other business relationships from the acquired entities;\n•\nThe loss of key employees of acquired entities;\n•\nThe ability of acquired entities to fulfill their customers’ obligations;\n•\nThe inheritance of known, and the discovery of unknown, issues or liabilities;\n•\nPre-closing and post-closing acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results and cash flows in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period;\n•\nThe failure of acquired entities to meet or exceed expected operating results or cash flows could result in impairment of goodwill or intangible assets acquired;\n•\nThe ability to implement internal controls and accounting systems necessary to be compliant with requirements applicable to public companies subject to SEC reporting, which could result in misstated financial reports; and\n•\nFuture acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, and goodwill impairment charges.\n13\nThe Company may not be able to continue to develop products or solutions to address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by ongoing change.\nTo be successful, we must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving our products and solutions, as well as introducing new products, solutions, and services, to address user demands.\nThe Company’s industry is characterized by:\n•\nEvolving industry standards;\n•\nFrequent new product, solution, and service introductions;\n•\nEvolving distribution channels;\n•\nIncreasing demand for customized product and software solutions;\n•\nChanging customer demands; and\n•\nChanging security protocols.\nFuture success will depend on our ability to effectively and economically adapt in this evolving environment. We could incur substantial costs if we must modify our business to adapt to these changes, and may even be unable to adapt to these changes.\nThe Company participates in a competitive industry, which may become more competitive. Competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements.\nWe face significant competition in developing and selling our products and solutions. To remain competitive, we believe we must continue to effectively and economically provide:\n•\nTechnologically advanced systems that satisfy user demands;\n•\nSuperior customer service;\n•\nHigh levels of quality and reliability; and\n•\nDependable and efficient distribution networks.\nWe cannot assure we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or technologies. Increased competition in mobile computing products, data capture products, radio frequency identification devices (“RFID”), printers, supplies, or software-based solutions may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins, and loss of market share, and could require increased spending on research and development, sales and marketing, and customer support. Some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products and solutions, which may create additional pressures on our competitive position in the marketplace.\nOperational Risks\nThe Company has substantial operations and sells a significant portion of our products, solutions and services outside of the U.S. and purchases important components, including final products, from suppliers located outside the U.S.\nShipments to non-U.S. customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of Net sales. We also expect to continue the use of third-party contract manufacturing services with non-U.S. production and assembly operations for our products.\nRisks associated with operations, sales, and purchases outside the United States include:\n•\nFluctuating foreign currency rates could restrict sales, increase costs of purchasing, and affect collection of receivables outside of the U.S.;\n•\nVolatility in foreign credit markets may affect the financial well-being of our customers and suppliers;\n•\nViolations of anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, could result in large fines and penalties;\n•\nAdverse changes in, or uncertainty of, local business laws or practices, including the following:\n•\nImposition of burdensome tariffs, quotas, taxes, trade barriers, or capital flow restrictions;\n•\nRestrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in, or purchase from, certain markets;\n•\nPolitical and economic instability may reduce demand for our products or put our non-U.S. assets at risk;\n•\nLimited intellectual property protection in certain countries may limit recourse against infringement on our products or may cause us to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories;\n•\nStaffing may be difficult including higher than anticipated turnover;\n•\nA government-controlled exchange rate and limitations on the convertibility of currencies, including the Chinese Yuan;\n•\nTransportation delays and customs related delays may affect production and distribution of our products;\n•\nGeopolitical uncertainty or turmoil could negatively affect our operations or those of our customers or suppliers;\n14\n•\nEffectively managing and overseeing operations that are distant and remote from corporate headquarters; and\n•\nIntegration and enforcement of laws varies significantly among jurisdictions and may change over time\nThird parties may allege that the Company or our suppliers infringe upon their intellectual property rights.\nPeriodically, third parties claim that we or our suppliers infringe upon their intellectual property rights. As we continue to expand our business and incorporate new technologies into our products and solutions, these types of claims may increase. Any of these claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel. To the extent a violation of a third party’s patent or other intellectual property right is established, we may be prevented from operating our business as planned and we may be required to pay costly judgments or settlements, enter into costly licensing arrangements or use a non-infringing method to accomplish our business objectives, any of which could have a negative impact on our operating margins.\nThe inability to protect intellectual property could harm our reputation, and our competitive position may be materially damaged.\nOur intellectual property is valuable and provides us with certain competitive advantages. We use copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and contracts to protect these proprietary rights. Despite these precautions, third parties may be able to copy or reproduce aspects of our intellectual property and our products or, without authorization, to misappropriate and use information we regard as trade secrets. Additionally, the intellectual property rights we obtain may not be sufficient to provide us with a competitive advantage and may be successfully challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or infringed. In any infringement litigation that the Company may undertake to protect our intellectual property, any award of monetary damages may be unlikely or very difficult to obtain, and any such award we may receive may not be commercially valuable. Furthermore, efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in the invalidation or narrowing of the scope of our intellectual property and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs. Because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of the Company’s confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. Some aspects of our business and services also rely on technologies, software, and content developed by or licensed from third parties, and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nWe currently use third-party and/or open source operating systems and associated application ecosystems in certain of our products and solutions. Such parties ceasing continued development of the operating systems or restricting our access to such operating systems could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nWe are dependent on third-parties’ continued development of operating systems, software application ecosystem infrastructures, and such third-parties’ approval of our implementations of their operating systems and associated applications. If such parties cease to continue development or support of such operating systems or restrict our access to such operating systems, we would be required to change our strategy for such devices. Our financial results could be negatively impacted by a resulting shift away from the operating systems we currently use and the associated applications ecosystem could be costly and difficult. A strategy shift could increase the burden of development on the Company and potentially create a gap in our portfolio for a period of time, which could competitively disadvantage us.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems throughout the Company to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to distributors and customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, and other technical activities, and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity, network communications, and email. Like many companies, we continually strive to meet industry information security standards relevant to our business. We periodically perform vulnerability assessments, remediate vulnerabilities, review log/access, perform system maintenance, manage network perimeter protection, implement and manage disaster recovery testing, and provide periodic educational sessions to our employees to foster awareness of schemes to access sensitive information. Despite our implementation of a variety of security measures, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent a cybersecurity incident. A cybersecurity incident could include an attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Phishing and other types of attempts to obtain unauthorized information or access are often sophisticated and difficult to detect or defeat.\nA cybersecurity incident, including deliberate attacks and unintentional events, may lead to a material disruption of our core business systems, the loss or corruption of confidential business information, and/or the disclosure of personal data that in each case could result in an adverse business impact as well as possible damage to our brand. This could also lead to a public disclosure or theft of private intellectual property and a possible loss of customer confidence.\nWhile we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these types of threats and incidents, there have been no material incidents incurred to-date at the Company. If our core business operations, or that of one of our third-party service providers, were to be breached, this could affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and data. Any failure on the part of us or our third-party service providers to maintain the security of data we are required to protect, including\n15\nvia the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and proprietary information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings, and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our suppliers’, distributors’, and customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While we continue to perform security due diligence, there is always the possibility of a significant breach.\nOur products and solutions that are deployed in customer environments also have the possibility of being breached, which could result in damage to a customer’s confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the customer’s data and systems. It is possible that such a breach could result in delays in, or loss of market acceptance of, our products, solutions or services; diversion of our resources; injury to our reputation; increased service and warranty expenses; and payment of damages. To date, we have had no material incidents related to the security on our products or solutions. Although we maintain insurance related to cybersecurity risks, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will cover the particular cyber incident at issue or that such coverage will be sufficient.\nWe may incur liabilities as a result of product failures due to actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims, which could include claims for property or economic damages or personal injury, in the event damages arise from our products as a result of actual or apparent design or manufacturing defects. Such design or manufacturing defects may occur not only in our own designed products, but also in components provided by third-party suppliers. We generally have insurance protection against property damage and personal injury liabilities and seek to limit such risk through product design, manufacturing quality control processes, product testing and contractual indemnification from suppliers. However, due to the growing size of the Company’s installed product base and growing number of applications in which our products can be used, an actual or alleged design or manufacturing defect could result in product recalls, customer service costs or legal costs that could have material adverse effects on our financial results.\nDefects or errors in the Company’s software products could harm our reputation, result in significant cost to us, and impair our ability to market such products.\nOur software may contain undetected errors, defects, or bugs. Although we have not suffered significant harm from any errors, defects, or bugs to date, we may discover significant errors, defects, or bugs in the future that we may not be able to correct or correct in a timely manner. Any future errors, defects, or bugs found in our software products and related services may result in delays in, or loss of market acceptance of, our products, solutions or services; diversion of resources; injury to reputation; increased service and warranty expenses; and payment of damages.\nWe depend on the ongoing services of our senior management and the ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nThe future success of the Company is substantially dependent on the continued services and contributions of senior management and other key personnel. The ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees is important to our long-term success. Competition for skill sets in certain functions within our industry is intense and we may be unable to retain key employees or attract, assimilate, or retain other highly qualified employees in the future. Any disruption in the services of senior management or our ability to attract and retain key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA natural disaster, widespread public health issue, civil unrest, or man-made disaster may cause supply disruptions that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nNatural disasters or widespread public health issues, including pandemics, may occur in the future and the Company is not able to predict to what extent or duration any such disruptions will have on our ability to maintain ordinary business operations. The Company’s operations and facilities are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. Following an interruption to our business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.  The consequences of a natural disaster or widespread public health issue may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe effects\nof the COVID-19 pandemic have and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial results, and results of operations.\nThe coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has spread rapidly worldwide, resulting in a broad number of governmental and commercial efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 globally, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns. The COVID-19 pandemic has been, and continues to be, complex and rapidly evolving, and has adversely impacted our business, primarily related to lower customer demand and higher fulfillment costs. The duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results depends on factors that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of COVID-19, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the extent to which vaccines and/or other medical treatments are developed and made available to the\n16\npublic, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, industry partners, suppliers and third party dealers, distributors, and resellers.\nThe federal, state, and local governments as well as foreign governments, to varying degrees, have imposed, and continue to impose, several protocols and regulations restricting the physical movement or other activities of individuals in an effort to limit the spread of COVID-19. We have implemented a number of measures in an effort to protect the health and well-being of our employees, customers and suppliers, including having the majority of office workers work remotely, limiting employee travel, and withdrawing from industry events.  The transition to working remotely for most of our office employees may impact our business operations, customer relationships, pose additional data security risks as well as impact our ability to attract and retain talent. The extent and duration of ongoing workplace restrictions and limitations, particularly in sites with significant headcount, could adversely impact our operations and our ability to execute on strategic imperatives for our business. As governments ease their restrictions and we allow our employees to come back to work in our offices in a controlled approach, we have modified our business practices, including implementing social distancing protocols, office capacity restrictions, health screening, provision of personal protective equipment, tracking and tracing protocols, and extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces. However, there is no guarantee that such protocols will be successful in preventing the spread of COVID-19 amongst our employees. In late 2020, certain vaccines were authorized by major regulatory bodies to help fight the infection of COVID-19, and certain other vaccines are in the late stages of development to provide such treatment.  At this time, the availability of authorized vaccines is highly limited, and the time required to make these vaccines available to all members of the public remains uncertain.  Further, we have experienced higher than normal employee absentee rates for employees who are unable to work from home, and even as employees return to our offices, we may be prevented from conducting business activities at full capacity for an indefinite period of time. The potential negative effects to our operations, including reductions in production levels, research and development activities, and increased costs resulting from our efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, may adversely affect our ability to deliver our products, solutions and services.\nIn addition, the continued spread of COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the worldwide credit and financial markets, which could limit our ability to obtain external financing and result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults, adversely affecting our liquidity. While the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, the duration and severity of any further economic or market impact of the pandemic remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that it will not have an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, including our ability to access capital markets, in the future.\nIf COVID-19 becomes more prevalent in the locations where our customers, suppliers, or we conduct business, we may experience more pronounced disruptions in our operations. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business and results of operations in future periods may be adversely affected. Moreover, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate other pre-existing risks, such as global economic conditions, political, regulatory, social, financial, operational and cybersecurity as well as similar risks relating to our suppliers and customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nZebra could be adversely impacted by the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union. Z\nebra maintains its European regional headquarters and a label converting facility in the U.K. and has significant operations and sales throughout Europe, including its regional distribution center located in Heerenveen, Netherlands. Following the U.K. formally withdrawing from the E.U. on January 31, 2020, the U.K. and E.U. entered into a transition period that ended on December 31, 2020. The E.U.-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement was entered into on December 24, 2020 and details the future relationship between the U.K. and E.U., and has resolved much uncertainty. Nevertheless, effective January 1, 2021, customs borders are in place between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Great Britain and the E.U., which could adversely impact Zebra’s operations and financial performance due to the increase in importation requirements that may lead to disrupted or delayed shipments in the region. Such disrupted or delayed shipments may also result in shortages of products and components or loss of customer confidence, which could affect Zebra’s financial performance.\nWe are exposed to risks under large, multi-year system and solutions and services contracts that may negatively impact our business.\nWe enter into large, multi-year system and solutions and services contracts with our customers that expose us to risks, including among others: (i) technological risks, especially when contracts involve new technology; (ii) financial risks, including the accuracy of estimates inherent in projecting costs associated with large, long-term contracts and the related impact on operating results; and (iii) cybersecurity risks, especially in solutions or managed services contracts with customers that process personal data. Recovery of front-loaded costs incurred on long-term managed services and software-based solutions contracts with customers is dependent on the continued viability of such customers. The insolvency of customers could result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program or product, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nWe enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses in the event we fail to properly estimate our costs.\nIf our initial cost estimates are incorrect, we can lose money on these contracts. Because many of these contracts involve new\n17\ntechnologies and applications and require the Company to engage subcontractors and can last multiple years, unforeseen events, such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, problems with our subcontractors or suppliers, and other cost overruns, can result in the contract pricing becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us and have an adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, a significant increase in inflation rates could have an adverse impact on the profitability of longer-term contracts.\nWe utilize the services of subcontractors to perform under many of our contracts, and the inability of our subcontractors to perform in a timely and compliant manner could negatively impact our performance obligations as the prime contractor.\nWe engage subcontractors on many of our contracts and our use of subcontractors has and may continue to increase as we expand our global solutions and services business. Our subcontractors may further subcontract performance and may supply third-party products and software. We may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by a subcontractor and the functionality, warranty and indemnities of products, software, and services supplied by a subcontractor. We are not always successful in passing along customer requirements to our subcontractors, and thus in some cases may be required to absorb contractual risks from our customers without corresponding back-to-back coverage from our subcontractors. Our subcontractors may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials, components, subsystems, and services they supply, or secure preferred warranty and indemnity coverage from their suppliers, which might result in greater product returns, service problems, warranty claims and costs, and regulatory compliance issues and could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have outsourced portions of certain business operations such as repair, distribution, engineering services, and information technology services and may outsource additional business operations, which limits our control over these business operations and exposes us to additional risk as a result of the actions of our outsource partners.\nWe are not able to directly control certain business operations that we outsource. Our outsource partners may not prioritize our business over that of their other customers and they may not meet our desired level of service, cost reductions, or other metrics. In some cases, our outsource partners’ actions may result in our being found to be in violation of laws or regulations, such as import or export regulations. As many of our outsource partners operate outside of the U.S., our outsourcing activity exposes us to information security vulnerabilities and increases our global risks. In addition, we are exposed to the financial viability of our outsource partners. Once a business activity is outsourced, we may be contractually prohibited from, or may not practically be able to, bring such activity back within the Company or move it to another outsource partner. The actions of our outsource partners could result in reputational damage to us and could negatively impact our financial results. Additionally, transitioning activities between new or existing outsource partners or across different geographies as well as insourcing activities could result in additional cost, time and management attention in order to effectively manage the transition, which could negatively impact our financial results.\nFailure of our suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers, and representatives to use acceptable legal or ethical business practices could negatively impact our business.\nIt is our policy to require suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers, and third-party sales representatives (“TPSRs”) to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including those regarding working conditions, employment practices, environmental compliance, anti-corruption, and trademark and copyright licensing. However, we do not control their labor and other business practices. If one of our suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers, or TPSRs violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are regarded as unethical, the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders could be canceled, relationships could be terminated, and our reputation could be damaged. If one of our suppliers or subcontractors fails to procure necessary license rights to trademarks, copyrights, or patents, legal action could be taken against us that could impact the salability of the Company’s products and solutions, and expose us to financial obligations to a third-party. Any of these events could have a negative impact on our sales and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party dealers, distributors, and resellers to sell many of our products and solutions, and their failure to effectively bring our products and solutions to market may negatively affect our results of operation and financial results.\nIn addition to our own sales force, we offer our products and solutions through a variety of third-party dealers, distributors, and resellers who may also market other products and solutions that compete with ours. Failure of one or more of our third-party dealers, distributors, or resellers to effectively promote our products and solutions could affect our ability to bring products and solutions to market and have a negative impact on our results of operations. Any changes to our channel program may cause some of our third-party dealers, distributors, or resellers to exit the program due to modifications to the program structure, which may reduce our ability to bring products and solutions to market and could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nSome of these third-parties are smaller and more likely to be impacted by a significant decrease in available credit that could result from a weakness in the financial markets. If credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for third-party dealers, distributors, or resellers and we are unable to successfully transition end-customers to purchase our products and solutions from other third-parties or from us directly, it may cause, and in some cases, has caused, a negative impact on our financial results.\n18\nFinal assembly of certain of our products is performed by third-party electronics manufacturers. We may be dependent on these third-party electronics manufacturers as a sole-source of supply for the manufacture of such products. A failure by such manufacturers to provide manufacturing services to us as we require, or any disruption in such manufacturing services up to and including a catastrophic shut-down, may adversely affect our business results. Because we rely on these third-party electronics manufacturers to manufacture our products, we may incur increased business continuity risks.\nWe are not able to exercise direct control over the assembly or related operations of certain of our products. If these third-party manufacturers experience business difficulties or fail to meet our manufacturing needs, then we may be unable to satisfy customer product demands, lose sales, and be unable to maintain customer relationships. Longer production lead times may result in shortages of certain products and inadequate inventories during periods of unanticipated higher demand. Without such third parties continuing to manufacture our products, we may have no other means of final assembly of certain of our products until we are able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility. This transition could be costly and time consuming. From time to time we may diversify our product sourcing footprint, similar to the actions we took with our efforts to reduce our reliance on Chinese-based manufacturing, which may result in additional costs.\nOur future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts, and components, as well as services and software to meet the demands of customers. We source some of our components from sole source suppliers.  Any disruption to our suppliers or significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur ability to meet customers’ demands depends, in part, on our ability to obtain in a timely manner an adequate delivery of quality materials, parts, and components, as well as services and software from our suppliers. In addition, certain supplies are available only from a single source or limited sources and we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner. If demand for our products, solutions or services increases from our current expectations or if suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our demand for other reasons, including as a result of natural disasters, public health issues, severe weather conditions, or financial issues, we could experience an interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies that could have a negative impact on our business. We have experienced shortages in the past that have negatively impacted our results of operations and may experience such shortages in the future. Credit constraints at our suppliers could cause us to accelerate payment of accounts payable by us, impacting our cash flow.\nIn addition, our current contracts with certain suppliers may be canceled or not extended by such suppliers and, therefore, not afford us with sufficient protection against a reduction or interruption in supplies. Moreover, in the event any of these suppliers breach their contracts with us, our legal remedies associated with such a breach may be insufficient to compensate us for any damages it may suffer.\nFinancial and Market Risks\nThe impact of changes in customs duties and trade policies in the United States and corresponding actions by other countries in which the Company does business could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe Company currently imports a significant percentage of our products into the U.S., and an increase in customs duties with respect to these imports could negatively impact the Company’s financial performance. During 2020, the Company successfully completed efforts to diversify its product sourcing footprint in order to reduce its reliance on Chinese-based manufacturing and mitigate the impacts of related customs duties.\nTaxing authority challenges may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves.\nWe are subject to, and may become subject to, ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. As a result, we may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters. In addition, we may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations. Such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to the Company’s effective tax rate and cash flows. Future changes in tax law in various jurisdictions around the world and income tax holidays could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, foreign rate differential, future income tax expense, and cash flows.\nForecasting our estimated annual effective tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty, and there may be material differences between our forecasted and actual tax rates.\nForecasts of our income tax position and effective tax rate are complex, subject to uncertainty and periodic updates because our income tax position for each year combines the effects of a mix of profits earned and losses incurred by us in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates, as well as changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the impact of various accounting rules and changes to these rules, the results of examinations by various tax authorities, and the impact of any acquisition, business combination, disposition or other reorganization, or financing transaction.\nAs a multinational corporation, we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions. The taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple, and sometimes conflicting, tax laws and regulations, as well as multinational tax conventions. Many countries have recently adopted, or are considering the adoption of, revisions to their respective tax laws based on the on-going reports issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and\n19\nDevelopment (“OECD”)/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) Project, which could materially impact our tax liability due to our organizational structure and significant operations outside of the U.S. Our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses resulting from our structure and operating model, the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region, and the availability of tax credits and carry-forwards. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment, and uncertainty. Tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, and the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Consequently, taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability and/or our effective income tax rate.\nEconomic conditions and financial market disruptions may adversely affect our business and results of operations\n.\nAdverse economic conditions or reduced information technology spending may negatively impact our business.\nGeneral disruption of financial markets and a related general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial condition through a reduction in demand for our products, solutions or services by our customers. If a slowdown were severe enough, it could require further impairment testing and write-downs of goodwill and other intangible assets. Cost reduction actions may be necessary and might lead to restructuring charges. A tightening of financial credit could adversely affect our customers, suppliers, outsourced manufacturers, and channel partners (e.g., distributors and resellers) from obtaining adequate credit for the financing of significant purchases. An economic downturn could also result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products, solutions and services; negatively impacting the ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis; result in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable; and require additional reserves for inventory obsolescence. Higher volatility and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for the U.S. Dollar against currencies such as the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Czech Koruna, Brazilian Real, and Chinese Yuan could negatively impact product sales, margins, and cash flows.\nIt is important that we are able to obtain many different types of insurance, and if we are not able to obtain insurance or exhaust our coverage, we may be forced to retain the risk.\nWe have many types of insurance coverage and are also self-insured for some risks and obligations. Our third-party insurance coverage varies from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third-party insurance. In addition, our third-party insurance policies are subject to deductibles, policy limits, and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis.  Further, certain types of coverages may be difficult or expensive to obtain. We self-insure against certain business risks and expenses where we believe we can adequately self-insure against the anticipated exposure and risk or where insurance is either not deemed cost-effective or is not available. If the amount of our third-party insurance coverage is not available or adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident, incident, or claim. Losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and unpredictable and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1.3 billion of outstanding debt, gross of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs. Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n•\nWe may experience difficulty in satisfying our obligations with respect to our existing indebtedness or future indebtedness;\n•\nOur ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n•\nWe may be at a competitive disadvantage with reduced flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changing conditions in the industry, including increased competition; and\n•\nWe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in the business.\nWe expect to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from operations. Our ability to meet our expenses and to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends on our future performance and ability to collect cash from our customers, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors.\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we may not be able to effect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital and debt markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants,\n20\nwhich could further restrict business operations. The terms of anticipated or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and/or principal on outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to access additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on our ability to satisfy the obligations in respect of our indebtedness.\nOur use of derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk may result in added volatility in our operating results\n. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. However, we do utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk associated with our indebtedness. To manage variable interest rate risk, we entered into forward interest rate swap agreements, which will effectively convert a portion of our indebtedness into a fixed rate loan. Under generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the fair values of the swap contracts are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as a component of “Other, net” if not hedged. The associated impact on our quarterly operating results is directly related to changes in prevailing interest rates. If interest rates increase, we would have a non-cash gain on the swaps, and vice versa in the event of a decrease in interest rates. Consequently, these swaps introduce additional volatility to our operating results.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, asset impairment, business acquisition purchase price allocations, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, tax matters, and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. New accounting guidance may also require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs and/or change our financial statements.\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines against the Company.\nAs part of our operations, the Company collects, uses, stores, and transfers personal data of third parties, employees and limited customer data in and across various jurisdictions. Laws and regulations relating to the handling of such personal data may result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines against the Company. Existing laws and emerging regulations may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing (sometimes conflicting) interpretations. Government officials, regulators and privacy advocates are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data, which may result in new interpretations of existing laws that impact our business. Compliance with these laws may require us to, among other things, make changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that may result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms.  Further, there is no assurance that we will be able to meet additional requirements that may be imposed on the transfer of personal data without incurring expenses. We may experience reluctance or refusal by customers to purchase or continue to use our services due to concerns regarding their data protection obligations. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or other processing, may subject the Company to enforcement actions and regulatory investigations, claims, legal proceedings or other actions, reputational harm and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business.\nThe unfavorable outcome of any pending or future litigation, arbitration, or administrative action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nFrom time to time we are a party to litigation, arbitration, or administrative actions. Our financial results and reputation could be negatively impacted by unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation or administrative actions, including those related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, or other anti-corruption laws. There can be no assurances as to the favorable outcome of any litigation or administrative proceedings. In addition, it can be very costly to defend litigation or administrative proceedings and these costs could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety, consumer, worker safety, and environmental laws.\nOur operations and the products we manufacture and/or sell are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety, consumer, worker safety, and environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with such existing or future laws and regulations could subject us to future costs or liabilities, impact our production capabilities, constrict our ability to sell, expand or acquire facilities, restrict what products, solutions and services we can offer, and generally impact our financial performance. Some of\n21\nthese laws are environmental and relate to the use, disposal, remediation, emission and discharge of, and exposure to hazardous substances. These laws often impose liability and can require parties to fund remedial studies or actions regardless of fault. We continue to incur disposal costs and have ongoing remediation obligations. Environmental laws have tended to become more stringent over time and any new obligations under these laws could have a negative impact on our operations or financial performance.\nLaws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories; recycling of both electronic products and packaging; reducing or eliminating certain hazardous substances in electronic products; and the transportation of batteries continue to expand significantly. Laws pertaining to accessibility features of electronic products, standardization of connectors and power supplies, the transportation of lithium-ion batteries, and other aspects are also proliferating. There are also demanding and rapidly changing laws around the globe related to issues such as product safety, radio interference, radio frequency radiation exposure, medical related functionality, and consumer and social mandates pertaining to use of wireless or electronic equipment. These laws, and changes to these laws, could have a substantial impact on whether we can offer certain products, solutions, and services, and on what capabilities and characteristics our products, solutions or services can or must include.\nThese laws impact our products and negatively affect our ability to manufacture and sell products competitively. We expect these trends to continue. In addition, we anticipate that we will see increased demand to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction or elimination of certain constituents from products, increasing energy efficiency, and providing additional accessibility."

    "text": "This section generally discusses fiscal 2020 and 2019 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 are not included herein.  Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 for this discussion.\nOverview\nZebra Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Zebra” or the “Company”) is a global leader respected for innovative Enterprise Asset Intelligence (“EAI”) solutions in the automatic identification and data capture solutions industry. We design, manufacture, and sell a broad range of products and solutions, including cloud-based subscriptions, that capture and move data, including: mobile computers; barcode scanners and imagers; radio frequency identification device (“RFID”) readers; specialty printers for barcode labeling and personal identification; real-time location systems (“RTLS”); related accessories and supplies, such as self-adhesive labels and other consumables; and software applications. We also provide a full range of services, including maintenance, technical support, and repair, managed and professional services. End-users of our products, solutions and services include those in the retail and e-commerce, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, hospitality, warehouse and distribution, energy and utilities, government, education, and banking enterprises around the world.  We provide products, solutions, and services in approximately 180 countries, with 128 facilities and approximately 8,800 employees worldwide.\nOur customers have traditionally benefited from proven solutions that increase productivity and improve asset efficiency and utilization. The Company is poised to drive, and capitalize on, the evolution of the data capture industry into the broader EAI industry, based on important technology trends like the Internet of Things (“IoT”), ubiquitous mobility, automation and cloud computing. EAI solutions offer additional benefits to our customers including real-time, data-driven insights that improve operational visibility and drive workflow optimization.\nThe Company’s operations consist of two reportable segments: Asset Intelligence & Tracking (“AIT”) and Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (“EVM”).\n•\nThe AIT segment is an industry leader in barcode printing and asset tracking technologies. Its major product lines include barcode and card printers, supplies, services, location solutions, and retail solutions. Industries served include retail and e-commerce, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and other end markets within the following regions: North America;  Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”); Asia-Pacific; and Latin America.\n•\nThe EVM segment is an industry leader in automatic information and data capture solutions. Its major product lines include mobile computing, data capture, RFID, services, and workflow optimization solutions. Industries served include retail and e-commerce, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and other end markets within the following regions: North America; EMEA; Asia-Pacific; and Latin America.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2021, we will move the retail solutions product line from our AIT segment into our EVM segment contemporaneous with a change in our organizational structure and management of the business.  We will begin reporting our results reflecting this change in the first quarter of 2021 and will present historical periods on a comparable basis.  The impact of this change does not have an impact to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is immaterial to our current and historical reportable segment results.\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19 Outbreak\nIn 2020, the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) spread rapidly worldwide, resulting in a broad number of governmental and commercial efforts to contain it, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns.  These events have resulted in significant declines in global economic activity and significant volatility in financial market valuations, the duration and extent of which continues to be highly uncertain.  The Company’s 2020 Net sales and profitability were negatively impacted by the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic which were most pronounced in the second quarter.\nWe serve a diverse mix of customers.  Some of our customers have experienced significant declines or suspensions to their operations, whereas others have experienced increases in their business volume.  While many of our supply chain partners in China temporarily suspended or modified their business operations in early 2020 as a consequence of COVID-19, we have\n26\nsubstantially mitigated the impact of these disruptions by taking exceptional actions, including alternative modes of product delivery and fulfillment, as well as providing protective equipment and hazard pay premiums for our front-line employees.\nThe federal, state, and local governments as well as foreign governments, to varying degrees, have imposed, and continue to impose, several protocols and regulations restricting the physical movement or other activities of individuals in an effort to limit the spread of COVID-19.  We have implemented a number of measures in an effort to protect our employees’ health and well-being, including having the majority of office workers work remotely, limiting employee travel, and withdrawing from in-person industry events.  In addition, as governments continue to ease their restrictions and we continue to allow our employees to come back to work in our offices in a controlled approach, we have modified our business practices, including implementing social distancing protocols, office capacity restrictions, health screening, provision of personal protective equipment, tracking and tracing protocols, and extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces.  Throughout the pandemic, distribution centers and repair centers have remained open at varying capacity levels to ensure continued support to our customers, many of whom provide essential goods and services to communities.\nDuring the past year, we considered the potential impacts of the global pandemic in qualitative impairment assessments of our long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use lease assets.  We concluded that it is not more likely than not that any of our long-lived assets are impaired.  Our analysis considered, among other factors:\n•\nthe nature of our products, solutions, and services as well as our position within our industry;\n•\nour highly variable cost structure;\n•\nthe assumption that the negative impacts from COVID-19 will be temporary; and that\n•\nthe Company will continue generating strong positive operating cash flows over the long-term.\nWe have also considered the adequacy of our capital resources, inclusive of available borrowing capacity and other financing facilities; the results of our most recent quantitative goodwill impairment assessment, which was last completed in the fourth quarter of 2020 and further discussed in Note 6,\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements; and that our market capitalization has continued to far exceed total net assets.  Finally, while we may experience a temporary increase in working capital levels, we do not anticipate a material impact to the realizability of current assets, such as accounts receivable or inventories, at this time.\nThe situation related to the pandemic continues to be complex and rapidly evolving.  In late 2020, certain vaccines were authorized by major regulatory bodies to help fight the infection of COVID-19, and certain other vaccines are in the late stages of development to provide such treatment.  At this time, however, the availability of authorized vaccines is highly limited, and the time required to make these vaccines available to all members of the public remains uncertain.  If COVID-19 persists or worsens before a safe and effective vaccine or other treatment is made widely available, there may be further external developments, such as restrictions imposed by government authorities or guidance issued by public health authorities, that are beyond our control and may impact our operating plans.  Parts of our business have experienced, and may continue to experience, operational disruption and customer demand impacts.  Since the onset of the pandemic, we have taken certain cost reduction actions to mitigate the impact to profitability and cash flow.  We cannot reasonably estimate the duration of the pandemic or fully ascertain its long-term impact to our business.\nAcquisitions\nReflexis\nOn September 1, 2020, the Company acquired Reflexis Systems, Inc. (“Reflexis”), a provider of task and workforce management, execution, and communication solutions for customers in the retail, food service, hospitality, and banking industries.\nThrough this acquisition, the Company intends to enhance its solution offerings to customers in these industries by\ncombining Reflexis’ platform with its existing software solutions and product offerings, further empowering front line workers to execute the next best action using real time data. The operating results of Reflexis are included within the EVM segment.\nThe Company’s total purchase consideration was $548 million, net of cash acquired.  The Company incurred approximately $21 million of acquisition-related costs, which primarily consisted of payments to settle certain existing Reflexis share-based compensation awards, as well as third-party transaction and advisory fees, that are included within Acquisition and integration costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAdditionally, in exchange for the cancellation of unvested Reflexis stock options, the Company granted replacement share-based compensation awards to certain Reflexis employees in the form of Zebra incentive stock options with a fair value of approximately $9 million. The stock options will be expensed over the weighted average future service period, which was 1.7\n27\nyears as of the acquisition date. See Note 15,\nShare-Based Compensation\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of these replacement awards.\nThe acquisition of Reflexis was funded, in part, by the issuance of a new term loan (the “2020 Term Loan”) in the amount of $200 million. The acquisition of Reflexis was otherwise funded using the Company’s cash on hand and borrowing under the Company’s existing Revolving Credit Facility.  See additional details related to the Company’s debt arrangements in Note 10,\nLong-Term Debt\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n.\nCortexica\nOn November 5, 2019, the Company acquired Cortexica Vision Systems Limited (“Cortexica”), for $7 million in cash.  Cortexica is a provider of computer vision based artificial intelligence solutions primarily serving the retail industry. Additionally, we incurred approximately $2 million of acquisition-related costs in 2019, which primarily included third-party transaction and advisory fees, that are reflected within Acquisition and integration costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The operating results of Cortexica are included within the EVM segment.\nProfitect\nOn May 31, 2019, the Company acquired Profitect, Inc. (“Profitect”), a provider of prescriptive analytics primarily serving the retail industry. The Company’s total purchase consideration was $79 million, which consisted of $75 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and the fair value of the Company’s existing minority ownership interest in Profitect of $4 million, as remeasured upon acquisition. Included within Other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2019 is a $4 million gain resulting from the remeasurement of the Company’s previously held ownership interest in Profitect.  Additionally, we incurred $13 million of acquisition-related costs in 2019, which primarily consisted of payments to settle certain Profitect employee stock option awards, as well as, third-party transaction and advisory fees, that are included within Acquisition and integration costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The operating results of Profitect are included within the EVM segment.\nTemptime\nOn February 21, 2019, the Company acquired Temptime Corporation (“Temptime”), a developer and manufacturer of temperature-monitoring labels and devices.  In connection with this acquisition, the Company paid $180 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Additionally, we incurred $3 million of acquisition-related costs in 2019, which primarily included third-party transaction and advisory fees, that are included within Acquisition and integration costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The operating results of Temptime are included within the AIT segment.\nProduct Sourcing Diversification Initiative\nThe Company commenced efforts in 2019 to diversify its product sourcing footprint to include sourcing products from Taiwan, Vietnam, and Malaysia, thereby reducing its reliance on Chinese-based manufacturing and the impacts of related customs duties (“tariffs”) on U.S imports from China.  In conjunction with this initiative, the Company incurred total one-time costs of $23 million, including $18 million and $5 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, which are primarily reflected within Operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company also made $8 million of incremental equipment purchases during the year ended December 31, 2020.  The Company has completed this initiative and has begun sourcing products from these alternative locations.  As of the end of 2020, these actions, along with certain U.S. pricing actions, have substantially mitigated the ongoing financial impacts of Chinese import tariffs.\nRestructuring Programs\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company committed to certain organizational changes designed to generate operational efficiencies (collectively referred to as the “2019 Productivity Plan”).  The organizational design changes under the 2019 Productivity Plan, which principally occurred within the North America and EMEA regions.  The 2019 Productivity Plan was completed in the fourth quarter of 2020.  Exit and restructuring charges, primarily related to employee severance and benefits, for the 2019 Productivity Plan were $11 million and $8 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSee Note 9,\nExit and Restructuring Costs\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the 2019 Productivity Plan.\n28\nResults of Operations: Year Ended 2020 versus 2019 and Year Ended 2019 versus 2018\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n(amounts in millions, except percentages)\nNet sales to customers by geographic region were as follows (amounts in millions, except percentages):\nOperating expenses are summarized below (amounts in millions, except percentages):\nConsolidated Organic Net sales growth:\n(1)\nOperating results reported in U.S. Dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency translation impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. This impact is calculated by translating the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period, inclusive of the Company’s foreign currency hedging program.\n29\n(2)\nFor purposes of computing Organic Net sales growth, amounts directly attributable to business acquisitions are excluded for twelve months following their respective acquisition dates.\n(3)\nConsolidated Organic Net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.  See the\nNon-GAAP Measures\nsection at the end of this item.\n2020 compared to 2019\nTotal Net sales decreased $37 million or 0.8% compared with the prior year primarily due to customer demand declines resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which had an overall negative effect on both of our segments and broadly across all regions.  The negative effect of the pandemic was most pronounced within our AIT segment, particularly in the second quarter of 2020.  AIT sales declines were partially offset by growth in our EVM segment, reflecting higher Services and software revenues, due in part from recent business acquisitions, as well as increased product purchases, particularly in the transportation and logistics and retail end markets, in response to the need to digitize and automate workflows in an increasingly on-demand economy.  Excluding the effects of acquisitions and unfavorable currency changes, the decrease in Consolidated Organic Net sales was 0.9%.\nGross margin decreased to 45.0% for the current year compared to 46.8% in the prior year. Gross margins were lower in both the AIT and EVM segments, reflecting unfavorable business mix, including larger deal size, and premium freight costs.  These declines were partially offset by productivity gains within our services offerings and a partial recovery of 2019 Chinese import tariffs in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nOperating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $1,352 million and $1,408 million, or 30.4% and 31.4% of Net sales, respectively.  As a percentage of Net sales, operating costs continue to trend favorably.  The decrease in Operating expenses over the prior year was primarily due to lower discretionary spending, employee incentive-based compensation, and intangible asset amortization expense. These reductions were partially offset by the inclusion of operating expenses associated with acquired businesses and costs associated with the diversification of the Company’s product sourcing footprint.\nOperating income was $651 million for the current year compared to $692 million for the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower Net sales and Gross profit, partially offset by the benefit of lower Operating expenses.\nNet income decreased 7.4% compared to the prior year due to lower operating income and higher income tax expense, which were partially offset by a decrease in Other expenses, net, detailed as follows:\n•\nThe Company’s effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were 10.0% and 9.0%, respectively.  The Company’s effective tax rate was higher in the current year as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher benefits of uncertain tax positions in the prior year, partially offset by higher income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates in the current year.\n•\nOther expenses, net was $91 million for the current year, compared to $94 million for the prior year. The increase in interest rate swap and foreign exchange losses in the current year were more than offset by the favorable impacts of lower interest rates and average outstanding debt levels.  Additionally, the prior year included $7 million of debt refinancing costs.\nDiluted earnings per share decreased to $9.35 as compared to $9.97 in the prior year primarily due to lower operating income and a higher effective income tax rate, which were partially offset by the benefit of lower weighted average shares outstanding.\nResults of Operations by Segment\nThe following commentary should be read in conjunction with the financial results of each operating business segment as detailed in Note 20,\nSegment Information & Geographic Data\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  To the extent applicable, segment results exclude purchase accounting adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, exit and restructuring costs, and product sourcing diversification costs.\n30\nAsset Intelligence & Tracking Segment (“AIT”)\n(amounts in millions, except percentages)\nAIT Organic Net sales growth:\n(1)\nOperating results reported in U.S. Dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency translation impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. This impact is calculated by translating the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period, inclusive of the Company’s foreign currency hedging program.\n(2)\nFor purposes of computing AIT Organic Net sales growth, amounts directly attributable to the Temptime acquisition are excluded for twelve months following its acquisition date.\n(3)\nAIT Organic Net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.  See the\nNon-GAAP Measures\nsection at the end of this item.\n2020 compared to 2019\nTotal Net sales for AIT decreased $53 million or 3.6% compared to the prior year primarily due to lower sales of printing products and supplies across most regions associated with COVID-19 induced customer demand declines, the impact of which was most pronounced in the second quarter of 2020, and unfavorable foreign currency changes. These declines were partially offset by growth associated with our Temptime acquisition.  Excluding the impacts of the Temptime acquisition and foreign currency changes, AIT Organic Net Sales decline was 3.7%.\nGross margin decreased to 47.3% in the current year compared to 49.8% for the prior year primarily due to unfavorable product mix, lower sales volumes, and premium freight costs, which were partially offset by recoveries of certain 2019 Chinese import tariffs in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nOperating income decreased 9.3% in the current year compared to the prior year. The decrease was due to lower Net sales and Gross profit, partially offset by the benefit of lower Operating expenses.\n31\nEnterprise Visibility & Mobility Segment (“EVM”)\n(amounts in millions, except percentages)\nEVM Organic Net sales growth:\n(1)\nOperating results reported in U.S. Dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Foreign currency translation impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar. This impact is calculated by translating the current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable prior year period, inclusive of the Company’s foreign currency hedging program.\n(2)\nFor purposes of computing Organic Net sales growth, amounts directly attributable to the Xplore Technologies Corporation (“Xplore”), Profitect, Cortexica and Reflexis acquisitions are excluded for twelve months following their respective acquisition dates.\n(3)\nEVM Organic Net sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.  See the\nNon-GAAP Measures\nsection at the end of this item.\n2020 compared to 2019\nTotal Net sales for EVM increased $23 million or 0.8% compared to the prior year primarily due to higher sales of support services, mobile computing products, and our recent acquisitions.  These increases were partially offset by lower sales of data capture products in most regions associated with continued COVID-19 induced customer demand declines, the impact of which was most pronounced in the second quarter of 2020, and unfavorable currency changes. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency changes, EVM Organic Net Sales growth was 0.5%.\nGross margin decreased to 44.3% in the current year compared to 45.6% in the prior year,\nprimarily due to unfavorable business mix, including larger deal size, and premium freight costs.\nThese declines were partially offset by productivity gains within our support service offerings, recoveries of certain 2019 Chinese import tariffs in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the contributions from our higher margin acquisitions.\nOperating income for the current year decreased 3.5% due to lower Gross profit despite higher Net sales, partially offset by the benefit of lower Operating expenses.\n32\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe primary factors that influence our liquidity include the amount and timing of our revenues, cash collections from our customers, cash payments to our suppliers, capital expenditures, repatriation of foreign cash, acquisitions, and share repurchases. Management believes that our existing capital resources, inclusive of available borrowing capacity on debt and other financing facilities and funds generated from operations, are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements and service our indebtedness. The following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years indicated (in millions):\n2020 vs. 2019\nThe change in our cash and cash equivalents balance during the current year is reflective of the following:\n•\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the favorable timing of collections from customers, favorable timing of vendor payments, as well as lower cash payments for employee incentive compensation, income taxes and interest. These benefits were partially offset by higher inventory levels.\n•\nNet cash used in investing activities included the Company’s acquisition of Reflexis in the current year, which consisted of $548 million cash paid, net of cash acquired, as well as $32 million in cash paid for additional long-term investments. The prior year’s cash used in investing activities included cash paid for the acquisitions of Temptime, Profitect and Cortexica totaling $262 million, as well as $22 million in cash paid for long-term investments.\n•\nNet cash used in financing activities during the current year included common stock repurchases of $200 million, net debt repayments of $40 million and net payments related to share-based compensation plans of $25 million, partially offset by the favorable timing of unremitted cash collections from the servicing of factored receivables of $109 million. Net cash used in financing activities during the prior year included to net debt repayments of $312 million, net payments related to share-based compensation plans of $32 million and common stock repurchases of $47 million.\nCompany Debt\nThe following table shows the carrying value of the Company’s debt (in millions):\nTerm Loan A\nThe principal on Term Loan A is due in quarterly installments, with the next quarterly installment due in June 2021 and the majority due upon the August 9, 2024 maturity date. The Company may make prepayments, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, and would be required to prepay certain outstanding amounts in the event of certain circumstances or transactions. As of December 31, 2020, the Term Loan A interest rate was 1.41%.  Interest payments are made monthly and are subject to variable rates plus an applicable margin.\n33\n2020 Term Loan\nIn September 2020, the Company entered into a new $200 million term loan (“2020 Term Loan”), with the proceeds used to partly fund the acquisition of Reflexis.  The Company repaid $100 million of principal during the fourth quarter of 2020, with the remaining principal due upon the August 31, 2021 maturity date.  The Company may make additional prepayments, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, and would be required to prepay certain outstanding amounts in the event of certain circumstances or transactions. As of December 31, 2020, the 2020 Term Loan interest rate was 2.25%.  Interest payments are made monthly and are subject to a variable rate plus an applicable margin.  Costs associated with issuing the 2020 Term Loan were approximately $1 million, which were capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the loan.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nThe Revolving Credit Facility is available for working capital and other general business purposes, including letters of credit. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had letters of credit totaling $5 million, which reduced funds available for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility from $1 billion to $995 million.  No borrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020.  Upon borrowing, interest payments are made monthly and are subject to variable rates plus an applicable margin. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on August 9, 2024.\nReceivables Financing Facilities\nThe Company has two Receivables Financing Facilities with financial institutions that have a combined total borrowing limit of up to $280 million. As collateral, the Company pledges perfected first-priority security interests in its U.S. domestically originated accounts receivable. The Company has accounted for transactions under its Receivables Financing Facilities as secured borrowings.  The Company’s first Receivables Financing Facility, which was originally entered into in December 2017 and was amended in May 2019, allows for borrowings of up to $180 million and will mature on March 29, 2021. The Company’s second Receivable Financing Facility, which was entered into in May 2019 and was amended in May 2020, allows for borrowings of up to $100 million and will mature on May 17, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets included $441 million of receivables that were pledged under the two Receivables Financing Facilities. As of December 31, 2020, $235 million had been borrowed, all of which was classified as current. Borrowings under the Receivables Financing Facilities bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. As of December 31, 2020, the Receivables Financing Facilities had an average interest rate of 1.04%. Interest is paid on these borrowings on a monthly basis.\nUncommitted Short-Term Credit Facility\nThe Company also entered into an uncommitted short-term credit facility (“Uncommitted Facility”) in August 2020.  The Uncommitted Facility matures on August 26, 2021 and allows for borrowings of up to $20 million.  Each borrowing must be repaid within 90 days, or earlier if the facility matures beforehand, and bears interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin.  Along with the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility, the Uncommitted Facility is available for working capital and other general business purposes. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Uncommitted Facility.\nSee Note 12,\nLong-Term Debt\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nReceivables Factoring\nThe Company has multiple Receivables Factoring arrangements, pursuant to which certain receivables are sold to banks without recourse in exchange for cash.\nTransactions under the Receivables Factoring arrangements are accounted for as sales under Accounting Standards Codifications 860,\nTransfers and Servicing of Financial Assets\n, with the sold receivables removed from the Company’s balance sheet. Under these Receivables Factoring arrangements, the Company does not maintain any beneficial interest in the receivables sold. The banks’ purchase of eligible receivables is subject to a maximum amount of uncollected receivables. The Company services the receivables on behalf of the banks, but otherwise maintains no significant continuing involvement with respect to the receivables. Sale proceeds that are representative of the fair value of factored receivables, less a factoring fee, are reflected in Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while sale proceeds in excess of the fair value of factored receivables are reflected in Net cash used in financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nIn 2020, the Company entered into a new Receivables Factoring arrangement with a bank, which allows for the factoring of up to €150 million of uncollected receivables originated from the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. This arrangement expands upon the Company’s existing Receivables Factoring arrangements, which allow for the factoring of up to $125 million of uncollected receivables originated from the EMEA region.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019 there were a total of $70 million and $60 million, respectively, of uncollected receivables that had been sold and removed from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n34\nAs servicer of sold receivables, the Company had $142 million and $33 million of obligations that were not yet remitted to banks as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These obligations are included within Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in such obligations reflected within Net cash used in financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nSee Note 19,\nAccounts Receivable Factoring\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nShare Repurchases\nOn July 30, 2019, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to an aggregate amount of $1 billion of its outstanding shares of common stock. The share repurchase program does not have a stated expiration date.  The level of the Company’s repurchases depends on a number of factors, including its financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors its management may deem relevant. The timing, volume, and nature of repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors and may be amended, suspended or discontinued at any time.  Repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases, including pursuant to a pre-set trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company repurchased 948,740 shares of common stock for $200 million.  During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased 237,886 shares of common stock for $47 million.  As of December 31, 2020, approximately $753 million of common stock remained authorized for repurchase under the program.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nIncluded in the Company’s Cash and cash equivalents are amounts held by foreign subsidiaries. The Company had $37 million and $26 million of foreign cash and cash equivalents included in the Company’s total cash positions of $168 million and $30 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nContractual Obligations\nZebra’s contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nIncludes leases of manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, sales and administrative offices, equipment and vehicles that are classified as operating leases. The contractual obligations above include future minimum payments, including payments for those periods where renewal options are reasonably certain to be exercised.\n(2)\nIncludes payments related to obligations under our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly-compensated employees to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation. The amount in “More than 5 Years” includes the obligations under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment, since we cannot estimate the timings of those terminations and withdrawals.\n(3)\nIncludes payments related to interest on the Company’s debt, as well as related settlements of interest rate swap agreements.  These payments are estimated based on applicable interest rates and margins along with the balance of outstanding debt as of December 31, 2020. Future interest payments may increase or decrease based upon fluctuations in market rates and/or the Company’s borrowing levels.\n(4)\nPurchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements, primarily raw materials and finished goods. Purchase obligations included in the table above are based on quarterly forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for products. The Company does not have contractual obligations related to take-or-pay arrangements.\n35\nUncertain tax positions of $8 million have been excluded from the table above because we cannot reliably estimate the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. See Note 16,\nIncome Taxes\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement prepared the consolidated financial statements of the Company under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The application of these principles requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions which affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We believe that our estimates, judgments, and assumptions are reasonable based upon available information. Our more significant estimates and assumptions include those related to the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities, development of fair value estimates when measuring the identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, development of reporting unit fair values as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and measurement of variable consideration and allocation of transaction price to performance obligations in revenue transactions. See Note 2,\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of these items as well as other accounting policies.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n, which did not have a significant impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 2,\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s adoption of this new accounting pronouncement.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThe Company has provided reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThese supplemental non-GAAP financial measures – Consolidated Organic Net sales growth, AIT Organic Net sales growth, and EVM Organic Net sales growth – are presented because our management evaluates our financial results both including and excluding the effects of business acquisitions and foreign currency translation, as applicable. Management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of our business from period to period and trends in our historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures presented.\n36"

    "text": "Market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates, commodity prices, and foreign currency changes. Zebra is primarily exposed to the following types of market risk: interest rate and foreign currency.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt issuances. Primary exposures include the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). We use interest rate derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps, to mitigate the majority of the Company’s exposure from interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances, thereby reducing the volatility of our financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating-rate debt. Generally, under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange floating-rate for fixed-rate interest amounts with an agreed upon notional amount.\nThe United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out LIBOR.  We continue to closely monitor the possible phase out of LIBOR to assess any impacts to our debt and interest rate swap contracts, including the necessity to amend any of those contracts in order to incorporate alternative reference rates.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.3 billion of debt outstanding under our debt facilities, which bears interest determined by reference to a variable rate index. A one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately $5 million. This exposure includes the impact of associated forward interest rate swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 11,\nDerivative Instruments\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these risk mitigation activities.  Exposure to variable interest may increase or decrease, to the extent that the Company’s borrowings under its Revolving Credit Facility or Receivables Financing Facilities increase or decrease, respectively.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe provide products, solutions and services in approximately 180 countries throughout the world and, therefore, at times are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates. In some instances, we invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable. We also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies. We manage these risks using derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency exchange contracts. See Note 11,\nDerivative Instruments\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of hedging activities.\nThe currencies that we are primarily exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Czech Koruna, Brazilian Real and Chinese Yuan. A one percentage point increase or decrease in exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar would increase or decrease our pre-tax income by approximately $2 million. This amount is inclusive of the impact of associated derivative contracts.\n37"

    "text": "INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n38\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Zebra Technologies Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Zebra Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 11, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing  separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\n39\nAcquisition of Reflexis Systems, Inc. - Valuation of intangible assets\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005.\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 11, 2021\n40\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except share data)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n41\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In millions, except per share data)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n42\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n43\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n(In millions, except share data)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n44\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n45\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1\nDescription of Business\nZebra Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries (“Zebra” or the “Company”) is a global leader providing innovative Enterprise Asset Intelligence (“EAI”) solutions in the automatic identification and data capture solutions industry. We design, manufacture, and sell a broad range of products and solutions, including cloud-based subscriptions, that capture and move data. We also provide a full range of services, including maintenance, technical support, repair, and managed and professional services. End-users of our products, solutions and services include those in retail and e-commerce, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, hospitality, warehouse and distribution, energy and utilities, education, and banking industries around the world. We provide our products, solutions and services globally through a direct sales force and an extensive network of channel partners.\nNote 2\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThese accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include the accounts of Zebra and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nFiscal Calendar\nThe Company’s fiscal year is a 52-week period ending on December 31. Interim fiscal quarters end on a Saturday and generally include 13 weeks of operating activity. During the 2020 fiscal year, the Company’s quarter end dates were March 28, June 27, September 26 and December 31.\nUse of Estimates\nThese consolidated financial statements were prepared using estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Examples of accounting estimates include: cash flow projections and other valuation assumptions included in business acquisition purchase price allocations as well as annual goodwill impairment testing; the measurement of variable consideration and allocation of transaction price to performance obligations in revenue transactions; inventory valuation; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash consists primarily of deposits with banks. In addition, the Company considers highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of less than three months to be cash equivalents. These highly liquid short-term investments are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of a change in value because of changes in interest rates.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our customers in the normal course of business. Collateral on trade accounts receivable is generally not required. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable that is based on expected credit losses. Expected credit losses are estimated based on a number of factors, including historical loss experience, the durations of outstanding trade receivables, and expectations of the future economic environment. Accounts are written off against the allowance account when they are determined to be no longer collectible.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of a moving-average cost (which approximates cost on a first-in, first-out basis) and net realizable value. Manufactured inventory cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead. Purchased inventory cost also includes internal purchasing overhead costs. Raw material inventories largely consist of supplies used in repair operations.\nProvisions are made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. Inventory provisions are based on forecasted demand, experience with specific customers, the age and nature of the inventory, and the ability to redistribute inventory to other programs or to rework into other consumable inventory.\n46\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of property, plant and equipment, which are\n30\nyears for buildings and range from\n3\nto\n10\nyears for all other asset categories. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or\n10\nyears.\nLeases\nThe Company recognizes right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities for its lease commitments with terms greater than one year.  Contractual options to extend or terminate lease agreements are reflected in the lease term when they are reasonably certain to be exercised.\nThe initial measurements of new ROU assets and lease liabilities are based on the present value of future lease payments over the lease term as of the commencement date.  In determining future lease payments, the Company has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components.  As the Company’s lease arrangements do not provide an implicit interest rate, we apply the Company’s incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future lease payments. Relevant information used in determining the Company’s incremental borrowing rate includes the duration of the lease, transaction currency of the lease, and the Company’s credit risk relative to risk-free market rates.\nThe Company’s ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and exclude lease incentives. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any significant residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nAll leases of the Company are classified as operating leases, with lease expense being recognized on a straight-line basis.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 740 Topic,\nIncome Taxes\n. Accordingly, deferred income taxes are provided for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company recognizes the benefit of tax positions when it is more likely than not to be sustained on its technical merits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of income tax expense. The Company has elected consolidated tax filings in certain of its jurisdictions which may allow the group to offset one member’s income with losses of other members in the current period and on a carryover basis. The income tax effects of non-inventory intra-entity asset transfers are recognized in the period in which the transfer occurs. The Company classifies its balance sheet accounts by applying jurisdictional netting principles for locations where consolidated tax filing elections are in place.\nThe Tax Cut and Jobs Act (“the Act”, or “U.S. Tax Reform”), enacted on December 22, 2017, contains the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”), Base Erosion Anti-Avoidance Tax (“BEAT”), and Deduction for Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”) provisions, which relate to the taxation of certain foreign income and are effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Company recognizes its GILTI, BEAT, and FDII inclusions, when applicable, within income tax expense in the year included in its U.S. tax return.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized, rather it is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Our annual impairment testing consists of comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill would be considered to be impaired and reduced to its implied fair value. We estimate the fair value of reporting units with valuation techniques, including both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry group.\nFair value determinations require judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, as well as market factors. Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires that we make a number of assumptions and estimates regarding our long-term growth and cash flow expectations as well as overall industry and economic conditions. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, projections of revenue and income growth rates, capital investments, competitive and customer trends, appropriate peer group selection, market-based discount rates and other market factors.\n47\nWe most recently performed our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2020 using a quantitative approach which did not result in any impairments. See Note 6,\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nfor additional information. We believe our fair value estimates are reasonable. If actual financial results differ materially from current estimates or there are significant negative changes in market factors beyond our control, there could be an impairment of goodwill in the future.\nOther Intangible Assets\nOther intangible assets consist primarily of technology and patent rights, customer and other relationships, and trade names.  These assets are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over the asset’s useful life which typically range from\n2\nyears to\n10\nyears.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of\nThe Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360,\nProperty, Plant and Equipment,\nwhich\nrequires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposition of the asset. If such assets are impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nInvestments in Securities\nThe Company’s investments primarily include equity securities that are accounted for at cost, adjusted for impairment losses or changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. These investments are primarily in venture capital backed technology companies where the Company's ownership interest is less than 20% of each investee and the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence.\nSee Note 8,\nInvestments\nfor additional information.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are primarily comprised of sales of hardware, supplies, services, solutions and software offerings.  We recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised goods or services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to receive, which includes estimates of variable consideration, in exchange for those goods or services.  We are typically the principal in all elements of our transactions and record Net sales and Cost of sales on a gross basis.\nSubstantially all revenues for tangible products, supplies and perpetual or term software licenses are recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment, transfer of control and risks of ownership to the customer, for which the Company has contractual right to payment.  Our service offerings include repair and maintenance service contracts, which typically occur over time, and professional services such as installation, integration and provisioning, which typically occur in the early stages of a project.  The average life of repair and maintenance service contracts is approximately three years.  Professional service arrangements range in duration from a day to several weeks or months.  Revenues for solutions, including Company-hosted software license and maintenance agreements, are typically recognized over time.\nThe Company elects to exclude from the transaction price sales and other taxes assessed by a governmental authority and collected by the Company from a customer. The Company also considers shipping and handling activities as part of its fulfillment costs and not as a separate performance obligation.\nSee Note 3,\nRevenues\nfor additional information.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development (“R&D”) costs are expensed as incurred, and include:\n•\nSalaries, benefits, and other R&D personnel related costs;\n•\nConsulting and other outside services used in the R&D process;\n•\nEngineering supplies;\n•\nEngineering related information systems costs; and\n•\nAllocation of building and related costs.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising is expensed as incurred.\nAdvertising costs totaled $\n25\nmillion, $\n19\nmillion, and $\n18\nmillion for the years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWarranties\nIn general, the Company provides warranty coverage of\none year\non mobile computers, printers and batteries. Advanced data capture products are warrantied from\none\nto\nfive years\n, depending on the product. Thermal printheads are warrantied for\nsix months\nand battery-based products, such as location tags, are covered by a\n90\n-day warranty. A provision for warranty expense is adjusted quarterly based on historical and expected warranty experience.\n48\nContingencies\nThe Company establishes a liability for loss contingencies when the loss is both probable and estimable. In addition, for some matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of loss is not possible, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Our financial assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value generally include our employee deferred compensation plan investments, foreign currency forwards, and interest rate swaps. In accordance with ASC Topic 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n(“ASC 815”)\n,\nwe recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and measure them at fair value. Accounting for the gains and losses on our derivatives resulting from changes in fair value is dependent on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.\nThe Company utilizes foreign currency forwards to hedge certain foreign currency exposures.  We use broker quotations or market transactions, in either the listed or over-the-counter markets, to value our foreign currency exchange contracts.  The Company also has interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the variability in future cash flows on debt.  We use relevant observable market inputs at quoted intervals, such as forward yield curves and the Company’s own credit risk, to value our interest rate swaps.  See Note 11,\nDerivative Instruments\nfor additional information on the Company’s derivatives and hedging activities.\nThe Company’s securities held for its deferred compensation plans are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. If active markets for identical assets are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly.\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of those financial instruments.\nSee Note 10,\nFair Value Measurements\nfor information related to financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company has share-based compensation plans and an employee stock purchase plan under which shares of Class A Common Stock are available for future grant and purchase. The Company recognizes compensation costs over the vesting period of up to\n4\nyears, net of estimated forfeitures. Compensation costs associated with awards with graded vesting terms are recognized on a straight-line basis.\nSee Note 15,\nShare-Based Compensation\nfor additional information.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe balance sheet accounts of the Company’s subsidiaries that have not designated the U.S. Dollar as its functional currency are translated into U.S. Dollars using the period-end exchange rate, and statement of earnings items are translated using the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation gains or losses are recorded in Stockholders’ equity as a cumulative translation adjustment, which is a component of AOCI within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAcquisitions\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires that the purchase price be allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.\nThe estimates used to determine the fair values of long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, can be complex and require judgment.  While we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement during the measurement period, which is up to one year after the acquisition date. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from revenues and operating activities and the determination of discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but due to the inherent uncertainty during the measurement period, we may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n(“ASU 2016-13”).  ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost.  It replaced the historical\n49\nincurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses.  With respect to the Company’s financial assets, including trade receivables and contract assets, a cumulative effect transition approach was applied.  In order to determine the transition impact of ASU 2016-13, the Company considered historical loss experience, the short duration of its trade receivables and durations of other financial assets, and expectations of the future economic environment.  The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a significant impact to the Company’s financial statements upon transition or for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2020-04,\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\n(“ASU 2020-04”). Subject to meeting certain criteria, ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions to applying contract modification accounting under existing generally accepted accounting principles for contracts that are modified to address the expected phase out of the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). Some of the Company’s contracts with respect to its borrowings and interest rate swap contracts already contain comparable alternative reference rates that would automatically take effect upon the phasing out of LIBOR, while for others, the Company anticipates negotiating comparable replacement rates with its counterparties. At this stage of its contract assessment, the Company does not expect ASU 2020-04 to have a material impact on its financial results.\nNote 3\nRevenues\nThe Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration which it expects to receive for providing those goods or services.  To determine total expected consideration, the Company estimates elements of variable consideration, which primarily include product rights of return, rebates, price protection and other incentives.  These estimates are developed using the expected value or the most likely amount method and are reviewed and updated, as necessary, at each reporting period.  Revenues, inclusive of variable consideration, are recognized to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in cumulative revenues recognized will not occur in future periods.\nWe enter into contract arrangements that may include various combinations of tangible products, services, solution and software offerings, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. We evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract has more than one performance obligation. This evaluation requires judgment, and the decision to combine a group of contracts or separate the combined or single contract into multiple distinct performance obligations may impact the amount of revenue recorded in a reporting period.  We deem performance obligations to be distinct if the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with readily available resources (“capable of being distinct”) and if the transfer of products, solutions or services is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (“distinct within the context of the contract”).\nFor contract arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices for each performance obligation. In general, standalone selling prices are observable for tangible products and software licenses, while standalone selling prices for professional services, repair and maintenance services, and solutions are developed primarily with an expected cost-plus margin approach.  Regional pricing, marketing strategies and business practices are evaluated to derive the estimated standalone selling price using a cost-plus margin methodology.\nThe Company recognizes revenue for each performance obligation upon transfer of control of the promised goods or services. Control is deemed to have been transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and has obtained substantially all of the remaining benefits from the goods and services.  The determination of whether control transfers at a point in time or over time requires judgment and includes consideration of the following: 1) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided as the Company performs its promises; 2) the Company’s performance creates or enhances an asset that is under control of the customer; 3) the Company’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Company; and 4) the Company has an enforceable right to payment for its performance completed to date.\nRevenues for products are generally recognized upon shipment, whereas revenues for services and solutions offerings are generally recognized by using an output method or time-based method, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met.\nRevenues for software are recognized either upon delivery or using a time-based method, depending upon how control is transferred to the customer.  In cases where a bundle of products, services, and software and solutions offerings are delivered to the customer, judgment is required to select the method of progress which best reflects the transfer of control.\nThe Company’s remaining performance obligations primarily relate to repair and support services, as well as solutions offerings.\nThe aggregated transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for arrangements with an original term exceeding one year was $\n974\nmillion and $\n724\nmillion, inclusive of deferred revenue, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\n50\nrespectively. On average, remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are expected to be recognized over a period of approximately\n2\nyears.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table presents our Net sales disaggregated by product category for each of our segments, Asset Intelligence & Tracking (“AIT”) and Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (“EVM”), for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):\n(1) Amounts included in Corporate, eliminations consist of purchase accounting adjustments.\nIn addition, refer to Note 20,\nSegment Information & Geographic Data\nfor Net sales to customers by geographic region.\nContract Balances\nProgress on satisfying performance obligations under contracts with customers is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Accounts receivable, net for billed revenues.\nProgress on satisfying performance obligations under contracts with customers related to unbilled revenues (“contract assets”) is reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Prepaid expenses and other current assets for revenues expected to be billed within the next 12-months, and Other long-term assets for revenues expected to be billed thereafter.  The total contract asset balances were $\n10\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  These contract assets result from timing differences between the billing and delivery schedules of products, services and software, as well as the impact from the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations for contracts that include multiple performance obligations. Contract assets are evaluated for impairment and\nno\nimpairment losses have been recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nDeferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of payments and billings in advance of our performance. The combined short-term and long-term deferred revenue balances were $\n581\nmillion and $\n459\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The Company recognized $\n256\nmillion, $\n219\nmillion and $\n181\nmillion in revenue that was previously included in the beginning balance of deferred revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOur payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products, solutions or services offered. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined that our contracts do not include a significant financing component.\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nOur incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract, which consist of sales commissions and incremental fringe benefits, are deferred and amortized over the weighted-average contract term. The incremental costs to obtain a contract are derived at a\n51\nportfolio level and amortized on a straight-line basis.\nThe ending balance of deferred commission costs, which are recorded in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $\n23\nmillion and $\n21\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization of deferred commission costs, which is recorded in Selling and Marketing expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, was $\n14\nmillion, $\n11\nmillion and $\n10\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Incremental costs of obtaining a contract are expensed as incurred if the amortization period would otherwise be one year or less.\nNote 4\nInventories\nThe components of Inventories, net are as follows (in millions):\nNote 5\nBusiness Acquisitions\nReflexis\nOn September 1, 2020, the Company acquired all of the equity interests in Reflexis Systems, Inc. (“Reflexis”), a provider of task and workforce management, execution, and communication solutions for customers in the retail, food service, hospitality, and banking industries.  Through its acquisition of Reflexis, the Company intends to enhance its solution offerings to customers in these industries by combining Reflexis’ platform with its existing software solutions and its EVM product offerings.\nThe Reflexis acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.  The Company’s cash purchase consideration was $\n548\nmillion, net of Reflexis’ cash on-hand.\nIn connection with its acquisition of Reflexis, and in exchange for the cancellation of unvested Reflexis stock options, the Company granted replacement share-based compensation awards to certain Reflexis employees in the form of Zebra incentive stock options. A total of\n38,228\nreplacement stock options were granted, with a weighted average acquisition-date fair value per option of $\n230\n. The total fair value of approximately $\n9\nmillion is primarily attributable to service to be rendered subsequent to acquisition and will be expensed over the remaining service period. As of the acquisition date, the weighted average future service period associated with the replacement options was\n1.7\nyears, and the weighted average remaining contractual life was\n7.7\nyears.  See Note 15,\nShare-Based Compensation\nfor additional details related to these options.\nThe Company incurred approximately $\n21\nmillion of acquisition-related costs during 2020, which primarily consisted of payments to settle certain existing Reflexis share-based compensation awards whose vesting was accelerated at the discretion of Reflexis contemporaneously with the acquisition.  Those payments, as well as $\n7\nmillion of other acquisition-related costs primarily related to third-party transaction and advisory fees, are included within Acquisition and integration costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe acquisition of Reflexis was funded, in part, by the issuance of a new term loan (the “2020 Term Loan”) in the amount of $\n200\nmillion.  The acquisition of Reflexis was otherwise funded using the Company’s cash on hand and borrowing under the Company’s existing Revolving Credit Facility.  See additional details related to the Company’s debt arrangements in Note 12,\nLong-Term Debt.\nThe Company utilized estimated fair values as of September 1, 2020 to allocate the total purchase consideration to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  The fair value of the net assets acquired was based on several estimates and assumptions, as well as customary valuation techniques, primarily the excess earnings method for technology and patent intangible assets, as well as exit cost methodologies for liabilities such as deferred revenues.  While we believe these estimates provide a reasonable basis to record the net assets acquired, the purchase price allocation is considered preliminary and subject to adjustment during the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments relating to facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date. The primary measurement period adjustment was related to the realizability of income tax net operating losses, resulting in a $\n12\nmillion decrease in deferred tax liabilities and a $\n12\nmillion decrease in goodwill.\nThe\n52\nprimary fair value estimates still considered preliminary as of December 31, 2020 include intangible assets and income tax-related items.\nThe preliminary purchase price allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows (in millions):\nThe\n$\n364\nmillion\nof goodwill, which is non-deductible for tax purposes, has been allocated to the EVM segment and principally relates to the planned integration of Reflexis’ solution offerings with the Company’s existing solution offerings as well as expansion in current and new markets, industries and product offerings.\nThe preliminary purchase price allocation to identifiable intangible assets acquired was:\nThe Company has not included unaudited proforma results, as if Reflexis had been acquired as of January 1, 2019, as doing so would not yield materially different results.\nCortexica\nOn November 5, 2019, the Company acquired\n100\n% of the equity interests in Cortexica Vision Systems Limited (“Cortexica”), a provider of computer vision-based artificial intelligence solutions primarily for the retail industry. The purchase consideration of $\n7\nmillion was primarily allocated to technology-related intangible assets of $\n4\nmillion and goodwill of $\n4\nmillion based on the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nAdditionally, we incurred approximately $\n2\nmillion of acquisition-related costs in 2019, which are included within Acquisition and integration costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The\ngoodwill, which will be non-deductible for tax purposes, has been allocated to the EVM segment and principally relates to the Company’s expansion of the Cortexica technologies into new markets, industries, and product offerings.\nProfitect\nOn May 31, 2019, the Company acquired\n100\n% of the equity interests of Profitect, Inc. (“Profitect”),\na provider of prescriptive analytics primarily for the retail industry. In acquiring Profitect, the Company seeks to enhance its existing software solutions within the retail industry, with possible future applications in other industries, markets and product offerings.\nThe Profitect acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The total purchase consideration was $\n79\nmillion, which consisted of $\n75\nmillion in cash paid, net of cash on-hand, and the fair value of the Company’s existing ownership interest in Profitect of $\n4\nmillion\n, as remeasured upon acquisition.  This remeasurement resulted in a $\n4\nmillion gain reflected within Other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2019.\nAdditionally, we incurred $\n13\nmillion of acquisition-related costs in 2019, which primarily consisted of payments to settle Profitect employee stock option awards, whose vesting was accelerated at the discretion of Profitect contemporaneously with the acquisition, as well as third party transaction and advisory fees.  Those acquisition-related costs are included within Acquisition and integration costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n53\nThe purchase consideration was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the acquisition date.  The fair value of intangible assets was derived utilizing a number of estimates and assumptions as well as customary valuation procedures and techniques, principally the excess earnings methodology.\nThe final purchase price allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows (in millions):\nThe $\n54\nmillion of goodwill, which is non-deductible for tax purposes, has been allocated to the EVM segment and principally relates to the Company’s expansion of the Profitect software offerings and technologies into current and new markets, industries and product offerings.\nThe final purchase price allocation to identifiable intangible assets acquired was:\nTemptime\nOn February 21, 2019, the Company acquired\n100\n% of the equity interests of Temptime Corporation (“Temptime”), a developer and manufacturer of temperature-monitoring labels and devices. The Company intends to expand Temptime’s product offerings within the healthcare industry, with possible future applications in other industries involving temperature-sensitive products.\nThe Temptime acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The Company paid $\n180\nmillion in cash, net of cash on-hand, to acquire Temptime. Additionally, we incurred $\n3\nmillion of acquisition-related costs in 2019, which primarily included third-party transaction and advisory fees that are included within Acquisition and integration costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe purchase consideration was\nallocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the acquisition date. The fair value of intangible assets was derived utilizing a number of estimates and assumptions as well as customary valuation procedures and techniques, including the relief from royalty and excess earnings methodologies.\nThe final purchase price allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows (in millions):\nThe $\n74\nmillion of goodwill, which is non-deductible for tax purposes, has been allocated to the AIT segment and principally relates to the Company’s expansion of its product offerings and technologies into current and new markets and industries.\n54\nThe final purchase price allocation to identifiable intangible assets acquired was:\nXplore\nOn August 14, 2018, the Company acquired Xplore Technologies Corporation (“Xplore”).  Xplore designs, integrates, markets and sells rugged tablets that are primarily used by industrial, government, and field service organizations. The acquisition of Xplore expanded the Company’s portfolio of mobile computing devices to serve a wider range of customers.\nThe Xplore acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The Company paid $\n72\nmillion in cash, net of cash on-hand, to acquire Xplore.\nThe final purchase price allocation to assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows (in millions):\nAt closing, in connection with the acquisition, the Company also made a $\n9\nmillion payment of Xplore debt and $\n6\nmillion in payments of other Xplore transaction-related obligations. Additionally, we incurred $\n8\nmillion of acquisition-related costs in 2018, which primarily included third-party transaction and advisory fees, and we incurred $\n2\nmillion of system integration costs in 2019. These costs are reflected within Acquisition and integration costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe $\n29\nmillion of goodwill, which is non-deductible for tax purposes, has been allocated to the EVM segment and principally relates to the Company’s expansion of the Xplore product offerings into current and new markets.\nThe final purchase price allocation to identifiable intangible assets acquired was:\nThe operating results of each acquired company have been included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Operations beginning on their respective acquisition dates.\nNote 6\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nGoodwill\nChanges in the net carrying value of goodwill by segment were as follows (in millions):\n55\nSee Note 5,\nBusiness Acquisitions\nfor further details related to the Company’s acquisitions and purchase price allocation adjustments.\nThe Company’s goodwill balance consists of\nfive\nreporting units. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2020 utilizing a quantitative approach. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by at least\n80\n%. There is risk of future impairment to the extent that an individual reporting unit’s performance does not meet projections. Additionally, if our current assumptions and estimates, including projected revenues and income growth rates, terminal growth rates, competitive and consumer trends, market-based discount rates, and other market factors are not met, or if other valuation factors outside of our control change unfavorably, the estimated fair value of our reporting units could be adversely affected, leading to a potential impairment in the future.\nNo events occurred during the fiscal years ended 2020, 2019, or 2018 that indicated it was more likely than not that our goodwill was impaired.\nOther Intangibles, net\nThe balances in Other Intangibles, net consisted of the following (in millions):\nAmortization expense was $\n78\nmillion, $\n103\nmillion, and $\n97\nmillion for fiscal years ended 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nEstimated future intangible asset amortization expense is as follows (in millions):\nNote 7\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n56\nProperty, plant and equipment, net is comprised of the following (in millions):\nDepreciation expense was $\n68\nmillion, $\n72\nmillion and $\n78\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nNote 8\nInvestments\nThe carrying value of the Company’s investments was $\n77\nmillion and $\n45\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are included in Other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balances Sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company paid $\n32\nmillion for the purchases of long-term investments, which primarily related to the acquisition of additional shares in an existing investment. In connection with this additional investment, the Company identified an observable price change that resulted in a $\n7\nmillion gain on its existing investment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company also received cash proceeds of $\n6\nmillion related to the sale of a long-term investment.\nNet gains related to the Company’s investments, which are included within Other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, were $\n5\nmillion, $\n3\nmillion, and $\n10\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nNote 9\nExit and Restructuring Costs\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company committed to certain organizational changes designed to generate operational efficiencies (collectively referred to as the “2019 Productivity Plan”), which were incremental to the Company’s 2017 exit and restructuring program (the “2017 Productivity Plan”). The organizational design changes under the 2019 Productivity Plan, which principally occurred within the North America and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) regions. The 2019 Productivity Plan was completed in the fourth quarter of 2020.  Exit and restructuring charges, primarily related to employee severance and benefits, for the 2019 Productivity Plan were $\n11\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe 2017 Productivity Plan, focused on organizational design changes, process improvements, and automation, built upon the exit and restructuring initiatives specific to the October 2014 acquisition of the Enterprise business of Motorola Solutions, Inc. (the “Acquisition Plan”). Exit and restructuring charges relating to the 2017 Productivity Plan, which were completed in 2019, were $\n2\nmillion and $\n11\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company’s total remaining obligations under its exit and restructuring programs were $\n5\nmillion, which are expected to be mostly settled within the next year and are reflected within Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNote 10\nFair Value Measurements\nFinancial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from three levels of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with ASC Topic 820,\nFair Value Measurements\n. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into the following three broad levels:\n57\n•\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs (e.g. U.S. Treasuries and money market funds).\n•\nLevel 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted in active markets but corroborated by market data.\n•\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.\nIn determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs to the extent possible. In addition, the Company considers counterparty credit risk in the assessment of fair value.\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as of December 31, 2020, are classified below (in millions):\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as of December 31, 2019, are classified below (in millions):\n(1)\nThe fair value of the foreign exchange contracts is calculated as follows:\n•\nFair value of regular forward contracts associated with forecasted sales hedges is calculated using the year-end exchange rate adjusted for current forward points.\n•\nFair value of hedges against net assets is calculated at the year-end exchange rate adjusted for current forward points unless the hedge has been traded but not settled at year end (Level 2). If this is the case, the fair value is calculated at the rate at which the hedge is being settled (Level 1).\n(2)\nThe fair value of forward interest rate swaps is based upon a valuation model that uses relevant observable market inputs at the quoted intervals, such as forward yield curves, and is adjusted for the Company’s credit risk and the interest rate swap terms.\nNote 11\nDerivative Instruments\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to such risks and may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under ASC 815. The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\nIn accordance with ASC 815, the Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and measures them at fair value.\nThe following table presents the fair value of its derivative instruments (in\n58\nmillions):\nThe following table presents the net (losses) gains from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges (in millions):\nActivities related to derivative instruments are reflected within Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nCredit and Market Risk Management\nFinancial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to counterparty credit risk of nonperformance and to market risk related to currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations. The Company manages its exposure to counterparty credit risk by establishing minimum credit standards, diversifying its counterparties, and monitoring its concentrations of credit. The Company’s counterparties are commercial banks with expertise in derivative financial instruments. The Company evaluates the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of its derivative and other financial instruments by considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. The Company continually monitors the creditworthiness of the customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of the Company’s credit policies are designed to mitigate concentrations of credit risk.\nThe Company’s master netting and other similar arrangements with the respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the same counterparty. We present the assets and liabilities of our derivative financial instruments, for which we have net settlement agreements in place, on a net basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the derivative financial instruments had been presented gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the asset and liability positions each would have been unchanged as of December 31, 2020 and increased by $\n3\nmillion as of December 31,  2019.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk Management\nThe Company conducts business on a multinational basis in a variety of foreign currencies. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises primarily from Euro-denominated external revenues, cross-border financing activities between subsidiaries, and foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The Company manages its objective of preserving the economic value of non-functional currency denominated cash flows by initially hedging transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign exchange forward and option contracts, as deemed appropriate.\n59\nThe Company manages the exchange rate risk of anticipated Euro-denominated sales using forward contracts, which typically mature within\ntwelve months\nof execution. The Company designates these derivative contracts as cash flow hedges. Unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until the contract is settled and the hedged sale is realized. The realized gain or loss is then recorded as an adjustment to Net sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Realized amounts reclassified to Net sales were $\n6\nmillion of losses for the year ending December 31, 2020, and $\n42\nmillion and $\n13\nmillion of gains for the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the notional amounts of the Company’s foreign exchange cash flow hedges were €\n585\nmillion and €\n564\nmillion, respectively. The Company has reviewed its cash flow hedges for effectiveness and determined that they are highly effective.\nThe Company uses forward contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments, to manage its exposures related to net assets denominated in foreign currencies. These forward contracts typically mature within one month after execution. Monetary gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in income and are generally offset by the transaction gains and losses related to their net asset positions.\nThe notional values and the net fair value of these outstanding contracts are as follows (in millions):\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nThe Company’s debt consists of borrowings under term loans (“Term Loan A” and the “2020 Term Loan”), Revolving Credit Facility, and Receivables Financing Facilities, which bear interest at variable rates plus applicable margins. As a result, the Company is exposed to market risk associated with the variable interest rate payments on these borrowings. See Note 12,\nLong-Term Debt\nfor further details related to these borrowings.\nThe Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates by utilizing interest rate swaps to hedge this exposure and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating-rate debt, based on current and projected market conditions.\nIn December 2017, the Company entered into a long-term forward interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $\n800\nmillion to lock into a fixed LIBOR interest rate base for its debt facilities subject to monthly interest payments. Under the terms of the agreement, $\n800\nmillion in variable-rate debt will be swapped for a fixed interest rate with net settlement terms starting in December 2018 and ending in December 2022. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company entered into additional long-term forward interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of $\n800\nmillion, containing net settlement terms, which started in December 2022 and ending in August 2024. The additional interest rate swap agreements effectively extend the risk management initiative of the Company to coincide with the maturities of Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility. These interest rate swaps are not designated as hedges and changes in fair value are recognized immediately as Interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company terminated certain interest rate swaps.  As part of the termination, the Company settled all of the swaps resulting in a $\n7\nmillion cash payment to counterparties that was classified within Net cash provided by operating activities. Hedge accounting treatment was discontinued on the swap that was designated as a cash flow hedge, which had less than $\n1\nmillion of pretax losses remaining in AOCI at the time of termination.\nNote 12\nLong-Term Debt\nThe following table shows the carrying value of the Company’s debt (in millions):\n60\nAs of December 31, 2020, the future maturities of debt, excluding debt discounts and issuance costs, are as follows (in millions):\nAll borrowings as of December 31, 2020 were denominated in U.S. Dollars.\nThe estimated fair value of the Company’s debt approximated $\n1.3\nbillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These fair value amounts, developed based on inputs classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy, represent the estimated value at which the Company’s lenders could trade its debt within the financial markets and do not represent the settlement value of these liabilities to the Company. The fair value of the debt will continue to vary each period based on a number of factors, including fluctuations in market interest rates as well as changes to the Company’s credit ratings.\nTerm Loan A\nThe principal on Term Loan A is due in quarterly installments, with the next quarterly installment due in June 2021 and the majority due upon the August 9, 2024 maturity date. The Company may make prepayments, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, and would be required to prepay certain outstanding amounts in the event of certain circumstances or transactions. As of December 31, 2020, the Term Loan A interest rate was\n1.41\n%.  Interest payments are made monthly and are subject to variable rates plus an applicable margin.\n2020 Term Loan\nIn September 2020, the Company entered into a new $\n200\nmillion term loan (“2020 Term Loan”), with the proceeds used to partly fund the acquisition of Reflexis.  The Company repaid $\n100\nmillion of principal during the fourth quarter of 2020, with the remaining principal due upon the August 31, 2021 maturity date.  The Company may make additional prepayments, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, and would be required to prepay certain outstanding amounts in the event of certain circumstances or transactions. As of December 31, 2020, the 2020 Term Loan interest rate was\n2.25\n%.  Interest payments are made monthly and are subject to a variable rate plus an applicable margin.  Costs associated with issuing the 2020 Term Loan were approximately $\n1\nmillion, which were capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the loan.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nThe Revolving Credit Facility is available for working capital and other general business purposes, including letters of credit. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had letters of credit totaling $\n5\nmillion, which reduced funds available for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility from $\n1\nbillion to $\n995\nmillion.\nNo\nborrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020.  Upon borrowing, interest payments are made monthly and are subject to variable rates plus an applicable margin. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on August 9, 2024.\n61\nReceivables Financing Facilities\nThe Company has\ntwo\nReceivables Financing Facilities with financial institutions that have a combined total borrowing limit of up to $\n280\nmillion. As collateral, the Company pledges perfected first-priority security interests in its U.S. domestically originated accounts receivable. The Company has accounted for transactions under its Receivables Financing Facilities as secured borrowings.  The Company’s first Receivables Financing Facility, which was originally entered into in December 2017 and was amended in May 2019, allows for borrowings of up to $\n180\nmillion and will mature on March 29, 2021. The Company’s second Receivable Financing Facility, which was entered into in May 2019 and was amended in May 2020, allows for borrowings of up to $\n100\nmillion and will mature on May 17, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets included $\n441\nmillion of receivables that were pledged under the\ntwo\nReceivables Financing Facilities. As of December 31, 2020, $\n235\nmillion had been borrowed, all of which was classified as current. Borrowings under the Receivables Financing Facilities bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. As of December 31, 2020, the Receivables Financing Facilities had an average interest rate of\n1.04\n%. Interest is paid on these borrowings on a monthly basis.\nUncommitted Short-Term Credit Facility\nThe Company also entered into an uncommitted short-term credit facility (“Uncommitted Facility”) in August 2020.  The Uncommitted Facility matures on August 26, 2021 and allows for borrowings of up to $\n20\nmillion.  Each borrowing must be repaid within\n90\ndays, or earlier if the facility matures beforehand, and bears interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin.  Along with the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility, the Uncommitted Facility is available for working capital and other general business purposes. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had\nno\noutstanding borrowings under the Uncommitted Facility.\nIn 2018, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Amendment No. 1”).  Amendment No. 1 resulted in a new Term Loan A with principal of $\n670\nmillion and increased the Revolving Credit Facility from $\n500\nmillion to $\n800\nmillion.  Also, as part of Amendment No. 1, the Company had a partial early debt extinguishment of $\n300\nmillion and repricing of its Term Loan B.  Amendment No. 1 resulted in $\n6\nmillion of non-cash accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and $\n1\nmillion of one-time charges related to third party fees, both of which were reflected in Interest Expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Amendment No. 1 also resulted in $\n2\nmillion of third party fees for arranger, legal, and other services that were capitalized.\nIn 2019, the Company entered into its second amendment to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (“Amendment No. 2”).  Amendment No. 2 increased the Company’s borrowing under Term Loan A from $\n608\nmillion to $\n1\nbillion and increased the Company’s borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility from $\n800\nmillion to $\n1\nbillion.  Amendment No. 2 also extended the maturities of Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility to August 9, 2024. Additionally, in conjunction with entering into Amendment No. 2, a payment of $\n445\nmillion was made to fully pay off the Company’s Term Loan B.\nThe refinancing of the Company’s long-term credit facilities during 2019 resulted in non-cash accelerated amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs of $\n4\nmillion and one-time charges of $\n3\nmillion, which included certain third party fees and the accelerated amortization of losses on terminated interest rate swaps released from AOCI.  These items are included in Interest Expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Additionally, issuance costs of $\n6\nmillion incurred related to this debt refinancing were capitalized and will be amortized over the remaining term of Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility.\nEach of the Company’s borrowing arrangements described above include terms and conditions that limit the incurrence of additional borrowings and require that certain financial ratios be maintained at designated levels.\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with its debt. See Note 11,\nDerivative Instruments\nfor further information.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.\nNote 13\nLeases\nThe Company leases certain manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, sales and administrative offices, equipment, and vehicles, which are accounted for as operating leases.  Remaining lease terms are up to\n12\nyears, with certain leases containing renewal options and termination options.\nOn January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC 842,\nLeases\n(“ASC 842”), which resulted in the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for operating leases with terms greater than one year.  Prior to the adoption\n62\nof ASC 842, the Company accounted for its lease arrangements under ASC Topic 840,\nLeases\n(“ASC 840”), with no ROU assets or lease liabilities being reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The Company adopted ASC 842 under a modified retrospective approach.  Thus, results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 are prepared under ASC 842, whereas results prior to that have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under ASC 840.\nThe following table presents activities associated with our operating leases (in millions):\nVariable lease expenses incurred were not included in the measurement of the Company’s ROU assets and lease liabilities. These expenses consisted primarily of distribution center service costs that were based on product distribution volumes, as well as non-fixed common area maintenance, real estate taxes, and other operating costs associated with various facility leases.  Expenses related to short term leases were not significant.\nCash payments for operating leases are included within Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations primarily include new lease arrangements entered into by the Company. ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations also include contract modifications that extend lease terms and/or provide us additional rights, changes in assessments that render it reasonably certain that lease renewal options will be exercised based on facts and circumstances that arose during the period, as well as lease arrangements obtained through acquisitions.\nReductions of the Company’s ROU assets and lease liabilities generally relate to modifications to lease agreements that result in a reduction to future minimum lease payments, as well as changes in assessments that render it no longer reasonably certain that lease renewal options will be exercised based on facts and circumstances that arose during the period.  The Company’s reduction of ROU assets and lease liabilities during 2019 primarily related to a modification to a distribution center lease agreement that resulted in a reduction to fixed future minimum lease payments.\nThe weighted average remaining term of the Company’s operating leases was approximately\n6\nyears as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.  The weighted average discount rate used to measure the ROU assets and lease liabilities was approximately\n5\n% and\n6\n% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n63\nFuture minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases as of December 31, 2020 were as follows (in millions):\nThe current portion of lease liabilities is included within Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRent expense under the Company’s operating leases during the year ended December 31, 2018, prior to the Company’s adoption of ASC 842, was $\n33\nmillion.\nRevenues earned from lease arrangements under which the Company is a lessor were not significant.\nNote 14\nCommitments and Contingencies\nWarranties\nThe following table is a summary of the Company’s accrued warranty obligations (in millions):\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to a variety of investigations, claims, suits, and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to, intellectual property, employment, tort, and breach of contract matters. The Company currently believes that the outcomes of such proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on its business, cash flows, financial position, or results of operations. Any legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the Company’s view of these matters and their potential effects may change in the future.\nDuring 2018, the Company settled in its entirety a commercial lawsuit resulting in a $\n13\nmillion pre-tax charge reflected within General and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIn 2020, the Company received approval of its exclusion request of customs duties that had been paid on certain products under Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 from September 1, 2019 through September 1, 2020 and commenced a process to request recovery of previously assessed amounts.  During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recorded recoveries of $\n12\nmillion, of which $\n2\nmillion and $\n10\nmillion were initially incurred during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Recoveries are recognized when the Company has completed all regulatory filing requirements and determined that receipt of amounts is virtually certain.\nFrom a segment perspective, $\n4\nmillion of the recovery related to AIT and $\n8\nmillion related to EVM.  Both the initially incurred costs and related recoveries were included within Cost of sales for Tangible products on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The Company believes that additional import duties that were\n64\npreviously paid are potentially recoverable; however, the final amounts and the timings of any such additional recoveries remains uncertain and, therefore, the Company has not recorded any amounts related to potential future recoveries in its financial statements as of December 31, 2020.\nNote 15\nShare-Based Compensation\nIn May 2018, the Company’s stockholders approved the Zebra Technologies 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2018 Plan”). The 2018 Plan superseded and replaced the Zebra Technologies Corporation 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2015 Plan”) on the approval date, except that the 2015 Plan, as well as the Zebra Technologies Corporation 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan that was previously superseded by the 2015 Plan, remain in effect with respect to outstanding stock appreciate rights that were granted under those plans until such awards have been exercised, forfeited, cancelled, expired or otherwise terminated in accordance with their terms. The awards available under the 2018 Plan include stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, performance share awards, cash-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance stock units, incentive stock options, and non-qualified stock options. No awards remain available for future grants under the 2015 Plan or previous plans.\nThe Company uses outstanding treasury shares as its source for issuing shares under the share-based compensation programs.  As of December 31, 2020, the Company had\n3,339,322\nshares of Class A Common stock available to be issued under the 2018 Plan.\nThe compensation expense from the Company’s share-based compensation plans and associated income tax benefit, excluding the effects of excess tax benefits or shortfalls, were included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2020, total unearned compensation costs related to the Company’s share-based compensation plans was $\n82\nmillion, which will be recognized over the weighted average remaining service period of\n1.7\nyears.\nStock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”)\nUpon exercise of SARs, the Company issues whole shares of Class A Common Stock to participants based on the difference between the fair market value of the stock at the time of exercise and the exercise price. Fractional shares are settled in cash upon exercise. The grant date fair value of SARs is expensed over the\n4\n-year\nvesting period of the related awards.\nA summary of the Company’s SARs outstanding is as follows:\nThe fair value of SARs is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial model. Volatility is based on an average of the implied volatility in the open market and the annualized volatility of the Company’s stock price over its entire stock history.\n65\nThe following table shows the weighted-average assumptions used for grants of SARs, as well as the fair value of the grants based on those assumptions:\nThe following table summarizes information about SARs outstanding as of December 31, 2020:\nThe intrinsic value for SARs exercised during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n60\nmillion, $\n58\nmillion and $\n59\nmillion, respectively. The total fair value of SARs vested during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n8\nmillion, $\n9\nmillion and $\n12\nmillion, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Awards (“RSAs”) and Performance Share Awards (“PSAs”)\nThe Company’s restricted stock grants consist of time-vested RSAs and PSAs, which hold voting rights and therefore are considered participating securities. The outstanding RSAs and PSAs are included as part of the Company’s Class A Common Stock outstanding. The RSAs and PSAs vest at each vesting date, subject to restrictions such as continuous employment, except in certain cases as set forth in each stock agreement. Upon vesting, RSAs and PSAs are released to holders and are no longer subject to restrictions. The Company’s RSAs and PSAs are expensed over the vesting period of the related award, which is typically\n3\nyears. Some awards, including those granted annually to non-employee directors as an equity retainer fee, vest upon grant. PSA targets are set based on certain Company-wide financial metrics. Compensation cost is calculated as the market date fair value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on grant date multiplied by the number of shares granted, net of estimated forfeitures. The fair value of each PSA granted includes assumptions around the Company’s performance goals.\nThe Company also issues stock awards to non-employee directors. Each director receives an equity grant of shares annually in the second quarter. The number of shares granted to each director is determined by dividing the value of the annual grant by the price of a share of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. New directors in any fiscal year earn a prorated amount.  During fiscal 2020, there were\n6,314\nshares granted to non-employee directors compared to\n7,371\nand\n7,980\nshares granted during fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The shares vest immediately on the grant date.\nA summary of information relative to the Company’s RSAs is as follows:\n66\nA summary of information relative to the Company’s PSAs is as follows:\nCash-settled awards\nThe Company also has cash-settled compensation awards, including cash-settled stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and performance stock units, which are expensed over the vesting period of the related award, which is up to\n4\nyears. Compensation cost is calculated at the fair value on grant date multiplied by the number of share-equivalents granted. The fair value is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the Company’s stock price, with remeasurements reflected as an adjustment to compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  Cash settlement is based on the fair value of share equivalents at the time of vesting, which was $\n9\nmillion, $\n6\nmillion and $\n2\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Share-equivalents issued under these programs totaled\n40,166\n,\n17,207\nand\n20,393\nin fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nReflexis Replacement Options\nIn connection with the Company’s September 2020 acquisition of Reflexis, and in exchange for the cancellation of unvested Reflexis stock options, the Company granted awards to certain Reflexis employees in the form of Zebra incentive stock options  (“Reflexis Replacement Options”).  Upon exercise of Reflexis Replacement Options, the Company receives cash proceeds equal to the exercise price and issues whole shares of Class A Common Stock to participants.  The grant date fair value, which was approximately $\n230\nper award and totaled approximately $\n9\nmillion, is expensed over the vesting period of the related awards, which averages\n1.7\nyears.  The fair value of the Reflexis replacement awards was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model, based upon the following weighted average assumptions:\nno\nexpected dividend yield; a volatility factor of\n39.75\n%; a risk-free interest rate of\n0.14\n%; and an expected life of\n2.78\nyears. See Note 5,\nBusiness Acquisitions\nfor additional details related to the Reflexis Acquisition.\nA summary of the Reflexis Replacement Options outstanding is as follows:\nThe following table summarizes information about the Reflexis Replacement Options outstanding as of December 31, 2020:\nThe intrinsic value of Reflexis Replacement Options exercised during fiscal 2020 was $\n1\nmillion. The total fair value of Reflexis Replacement Options vested during fiscal 2020 was $\n2\nmillion.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\n67\nIn May 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved the Zebra Technologies Corporation 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“2020 ESPP”), which supersedes the 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“2011 ESPP”) and became effective on July 1, 2020. Like the 2011 ESPP, the 2020 ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase common stock at\n95\n% of the fair market value at the date of purchase. Employees may make purchases by cash or payroll deductions up to certain limits. The aggregate number of shares that may be purchased under the 2020 ESPP is\n1,500,000\nshares. As of December 31, 2020,\n1,480,004\nshares were available for future purchase.\nNote 16\nIncome Taxes\nThe geographical sources of income (loss) before income taxes were as follows (in millions):\nIncome tax expense (benefit) consisted of the following (in millions):\nThe Company’s effective tax rates were\n10.0\n%,\n9.0\n% and\n19.7\n% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to our actual income tax rate is provided below:\n68\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, the generation of tax credits and the favorable impacts of share-based compensation benefits.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company’s effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the favorable impacts of share-based compensation benefits, lapses of the statute of limitations on uncertain tax positions, and the generation of tax credits.  These benefits were partially offset by the impacts of foreign earnings and deemed royalties taxed in the U.S.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company’s effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the generation of tax credits. These benefits were partially offset by increases related to foreign earnings subject to U.S. taxation, the U.S. impact of the Enterprise acquisition and certain discrete items. The discrete items included the favorable impacts of reductions in valuation allowances and share-based compensation benefits, which were offset by audit settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for the fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015 and an increase in uncertain tax positions resulting from interpretive guidance issued during the year.\nOn March 27, 2020, the President of the United States signed into tax law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). The provisions of the CARES Act did not have a significant impact to our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020. Management continues to monitor developments and guidance on the CARES Act and other coronavirus tax relief throughout the world for potential impacts.\nThe Company earns a significant amount of its operating income outside of the U.S that is taxed at rates different than the U.S. federal statutory rate.  The Company’s principal foreign jurisdictions that provide sources of operating income are the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Luxembourg.  The Company has received an incentivized tax rate by the Singapore Economic Development Board, which reduces the income tax rate in that jurisdiction effective for calendar years 2019 to 2023. The Company has committed to making additional investments in Singapore over the period 2019 to 2022.  However, should the Company not make these investments in accordance with the agreement, any incentive benefit would have to be repaid to the Singapore tax authorities.\nTax effects of temporary differences that resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):\nIn 2019, the Company reorganized its Luxembourg holding company structure which resulted in a taxable gain in Luxembourg that was offset by operating loss carryforwards.  There was no net impact to the provision for income taxes as these activities also resulted in the realization of deferred tax liabilities related to depreciation and amortization and a corresponding increase in valuation allowances.\n69\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $\n406\nmillion (tax effected) of net operating losses (“NOLs”) and $\n36\nmillion of credit carryforwards. Approximately $\n72\nmillion of NOLs will expire beginning in 2021 through 2040, and $\n29\nmillion of credits will expire beginning in 2021 through 2037, with the remaining amounts of NOLs and credit carryforwards having no expiration dates.\nThe Company is subject to the GILTI, BEAT and FDII provisions, for which we recorded income tax expense of $\n8\nmillion, $\n12\nmillion and $\n10\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These impacts are included in the calculation of the Company’s effective tax rate.\nEffective 2019, the Company was no longer permanently reinvested with respect to its U.S. directly-owned foreign subsidiary earnings. For periods after 2017, the Company is subject to U.S. income tax on substantially all foreign earnings under the GILTI provisions, while any remaining foreign earnings are eligible for the new dividends received deduction. As a result, future repatriation of earnings will no longer be subject to U.S. income tax but may be subject to currency translation gains or losses. Where required, the Company has recorded a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes on current earnings.  Additionally, gains and losses on any future taxable dispositions of U.S.-owned foreign affiliates continue to be subject to U.S. income tax. Thus, as a result of these changes, the assertion of permanent reinvestment is no longer applicable under current U.S. tax laws.\nThe Company has not recognized deferred tax liabilities in the U.S. with respect to its outside basis differences in its directly-owned foreign affiliates. It is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on these indefinitely reinvested earnings.\nUnrecognized tax benefits\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were $\n8\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate.  The Company is currently undergoing U.S. federal income tax audits for the tax years 2017 and 2018.  Fiscal 2004 through 2018 remain open to examination by multiple foreign and U.S. state taxing jurisdictions.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company settled and made payment for a tax dispute for $\n19\nmillion.  Additionally, the statute of limitations on the U.S. federal income tax audit years 2013, 2014 and 2015 lapsed, resulting in a total benefit of $\n20\nmillion during 2019. As of December 31, 2020,\nno\nother significant uncertain tax positions are expected to be settled within the next twelve months.  Due to uncertainties in any tax audit or litigation outcome, the Company’s estimates of the ultimate settlement or other uncertain tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from estimates.\nThe Company recognized a net benefit of $\n2\nmillion for interest and penalties related to income tax matters during the year ended December 31, 2020, and a net expense of $\n6\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The net benefit or expense associated with interest and penalties were reflected within Income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The Company has included $\n6\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion of estimated interest and penalty obligations within Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNote 17\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic net earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares assuming dilution. Dilutive common shares outstanding is computed using the Treasury Stock method and, in periods of\n70\nincome, reflects the additional shares that would be outstanding if dilutive stock options were exercised for common shares during the period.\nEarnings per share (in millions, except share data):\nAnti-dilutive options to purchase common shares are excluded from diluted earnings per share calculations.  There were\n46,128\n,\n47,240\n, and\n72,856\nshares that were anti-dilutive for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nNote 18\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nStockholders’ equity includes certain items classified as AOCI, including:\n•\nUnrealized (loss) gain on anticipated sales hedging transactions\nrelates to derivative instruments used to hedge the exposure related to currency exchange rates for forecasted Euro sales. These hedges are designated as cash flow hedges, and the Company defers income statement recognition of gains and losses until the hedged transaction occurs. See Note 11,\nDerivative Instruments\nfor more details.\n•\nUnrealized gain (loss) on forward interest rate swaps hedging transactions\nrelates to certain interest rate swaps that the Company previously entered into as part of its strategy to mitigate interest rate risk exposure associated with its variable rate debt.  These particular interest rate swaps, which were designated as cash flow hedges, were terminated prior to 2019, with remaining losses being reclassified out of AOCI through the third quarter of 2019. Pre-tax losses were reclassified into Interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 11,\nDerivative Instruments\nfor more details.\n•\nForeign currency translation adjustments\nrelate to the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiary companies that have designated a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. The Company is required to translate the subsidiary functional currency financial statements to U.S. Dollars using a combination of historical, period end, and average foreign exchange rates. This combination of rates creates the foreign currency translation adjustment component of AOCI.\n71\nThe changes in each component of AOCI during the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows (in millions):\n(1) See Note 11,\nDerivative Instruments\nregarding timing of reclassifications to operating results.\nNote 19\nAccounts Receivable Factoring\nThe Company has multiple Receivables Factoring arrangements, pursuant to which certain receivables are sold to banks without recourse in exchange for cash. Transactions under the Receivables Factoring arrangements are accounted for as sales under ASC 860,\nTransfers and Servicing of Financial Assets\n, with the sold receivables removed from the Company’s balance sheet. Under these Receivables Factoring arrangements, the Company does not maintain any beneficial interest in the receivables sold. The banks’ purchase of eligible receivables is subject to a maximum amount of uncollected receivables. The Company services the receivables on behalf of the banks, but otherwise maintains no significant continuing involvement with respect to the receivables. Sale proceeds that are representative of the fair value of factored receivables, less a factoring fee, are reflected in Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, while sale proceeds in excess of the fair value of factored receivables are reflected in Net cash provided by financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nIn 2020, the Company entered into a new Receivables Factoring arrangement with a bank, which allows for the factoring of up to €\n150\nmillion of uncollected receivables originated from the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. The Company is required to maintain a portion of sales proceeds as deposits in a restricted cash account that is released to the Company as it satisfies its obligations as servicer of sold receivables, which totaled $\n24\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and is classified within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company’s other active Receivable Factoring arrangements, which were entered into in 2018 and 2019, also allow for the factoring of up to $\n125\nmillion of uncollected receivables originated from the EMEA region.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company received cash proceeds of $\n1,291\nmillion, $\n409\nmillion and $\n33\nmillion, respectively, from the sales of accounts receivables under its factoring arrangements. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were a total of $\n70\nmillion and $\n60\nmillion, respectively, of uncollected receivables that had been sold and removed from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n72\nAs servicer of sold receivables, the Company had $\n142\nmillion and $\n33\nmillion of obligations that were not yet remitted to banks as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These obligations are included within Accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in such obligations reflected within Net cash used in financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFees incurred in connection with these arrangements were not significant.\nNote 20\nSegment Information & Geographic Data\nSegment results\nThe Company’s operations consist of\ntwo\nreportable segments: Asset Intelligence & Tracking (“AIT”) and Enterprise Visibility & Mobility (“EVM”). The reportable segments have been identified based on the financial data utilized by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker or “CODM”) to assess segment performance and allocate resources among the Company’s segments. The CODM reviews adjusted operating income to assess segment profitability. To the extent applicable, segment operating income excludes purchase accounting adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, exit and restructuring costs, and product sourcing diversification costs. Segment assets are not reviewed by the Company’s CODM and therefore are not disclosed below.\nFinancial information by segment is presented as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nTo the extent applicable, amounts included in Corporate, eliminations consist of purchase accounting adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration costs, impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, exit and restructuring costs, and product sourcing diversification costs.\n(2)\nAIT and EVM segment operating income includes depreciation and share-based compensation expense. The amounts of depreciation and share-based compensation expense attributable to AIT and EVM are proportionate to each segment’s Net sales.\nSales to significant customers\nOur Net sales to significant customers as a percentage of the total Company’s Net sales by segment were as follows:\nThese customers accounted for\n13.6\n%,\n6.7\n%, and\n20.4\n%, respectively, of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020, and\n16.8\n%,\n7.8\n% and\n20.6\n%, respectively, of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2019.  No other customer accounted for more than 10% of total Net sales during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018, or more than 10% of outstanding\n73\naccounts receivables as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.  All three of the above customers are distributors of the Company’s products and solutions and not end users.\nGeographic data\nInformation regarding the Company’s operations by geographic area is contained in the following tables. Net sales amounts are attributed to geographic area based on customer location.\nNet sales by region were as follows (in millions):\nThe United States and Germany were the only countries that accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nNet sales during these years were as follows (in millions):\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company presented revenues by major country on the same basis as revenues by region, which is based on customer location. Prior to 2019, the Company presented revenues by major country based on the country where products, solutions, and services were invoiced from. Revenues by major country for the year ended December 31, 2018 are presented above based on the location of customer, in order to conform to the same basis of presentation as the subsequent years.\nGeographic data for long-lived assets is as follows (in millions):\nLong-lived assets are defined by the Company as property, plant and equipment as well as ROU assets.  ROU assets were  recognized upon adoption of  ASC 842 in 2019, prior to which, there were no long-lived assets related to leasing activities.  Primarily all of the Company’s long-lived assets in the North America region are located in the United States.\nNote 21\nSupplementary Financial Information\n74\nThe components of Accrued liabilities are as follows (in millions):\nSummary of Quarterly Results of Operations (unaudited, in millions):\n75"

    "text": "Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. The evaluation was conducted under the supervision of our Disclosure Committee, and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that (i) the information required to be disclosed by us in this Form 10-K was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or furnish under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework as released in 2013. Based on this assessment and those criteria, our management believes that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on Zebra’s internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young LLP’s report is included in the latter portion of this Item 9A.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2020, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Zebra have been prevented or detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\n76\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Zebra Technologies Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Zebra Technologies Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Zebra Technologies Corporation (the “Company”) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)  (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Zebra Technologies Corporation as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 and our report dated February 11, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures  that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or  disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/Ernst & Young LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 11, 2021\n77"
