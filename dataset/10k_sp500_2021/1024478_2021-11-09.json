    "text": "General\nRockwell Automation, Inc. (“Rockwell Automation” or the “Company”)\nis a global leader in industrial automation and digital transformation. We connect the imaginations of people with the potential of technology to expand what is humanly possible, making the world more productive and more sustainable.\nOur hardware and software products, solutions and services are designed to meet our customers’ needs to reduce total cost of ownership, maximize asset utilization, improve time to market and reduce enterprise business risk. See Item 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(MD&A)\nfor additional information on our business and long-term strategy.\nThe Company continues the business founded as the Allen-Bradley Company in 1903. The privately-owned Allen-Bradley Company was a leading North American manufacturer of industrial automation equipment when the former Rockwell International Corporation (RIC) purchased it in 1985.\nThe Company was incorporated in Delaware in connection with a tax-free reorganization completed on December 6, 1996, pursuant to which we divested our former aerospace and defense businesses (the A&D Business) to The Boeing Company (Boeing). In the reorganization, RIC contributed all of its businesses, other than the A&D Business, to the Company and distributed all capital stock of the Company to RIC’s shareowners. Boeing then acquired RIC.\nAs used herein, the terms “we”, “us”, “our”, “Rockwell Automation” or the “Company” include wholly-owned and controlled majority-owned subsidiaries and predecessors unless the context indicates otherwise. Information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to our continuing businesses unless otherwise indicated.\nWhenever an Item of this Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to information in our Proxy Statement for our Annual Meeting of Shareowners to be held on February 1, 2022 (the Proxy Statement), or to information under specific captions in Item 7.\nMD&A\n, or in Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n(the Consolidated Financial Statements), the information is incorporated in that Item by reference. All date references to years and quarters refer to our fiscal year and quarters unless otherwise stated.\nOperating Segments\nStarting in fiscal 2021, we have three operating segments: Intelligent Devices, Software & Control, and Lifecycle Services.

Major markets served by all segments consist of discrete end markets (e.g., Automotive, Semiconductor, and Warehousing & Logistics), hybrid end markets (e.g., Food & Beverage, and Life Sciences), and process end markets (e.g., Oil & Gas, Metals, and Chemicals).\nDuring fiscal 2020 and 2019, we had two operating segments: Architecture & Software and Control Products & Solutions. Segment information presented for those periods has been recast to reflect our new operating segments. See Note 19 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our operating segments.\nGeographic Information\nWe do business in more than 100 countries around the world. The largest sales outside the United States on a country-of-destination basis are in China, Canada, Italy, Mexico, Germany, and the United Kingdom. See Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nfor a discussion of risks associated with our global operations.\n3\nCompetition\nOur competitors range from large diversified corporations that may also have business interests outside of industrial automation to smaller companies that offer a limited portfolio of industrial automation products, solutions and services. Factors that influence our competitive position include the breadth of our product portfolio and scope of solutions, technology differentiation, domain expertise, installed base, distribution network, quality of hardware and software products, solutions and services, global presence and price. Major competitors include Siemens AG, ABB Ltd, Schneider Electric SA, Emerson Electric Co., Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Honeywell International Inc., AVEVA Group plc, Dassault Systemes, and Aspen Technology, Inc.\nDistribution\nIn most countries, we sell primarily through independent distributors in conjunction with our direct sales force. Approximately 75 percent of our global sales are through independent distributors. Sales to our largest distributor in 2021, 2020, and 2019 were approximately 10 percent of our total sales.\nEmployees\nSee Item 7.\nMD&A\nfor information on our employees, including information related to attracting, developing, and retaining highly qualified talent.\nRaw Materials\nWe purchase a wide range of equipment, components, finished products and materials used in our business.

    "text": "In the ordinary course of our business, we face various strategic, operating, compliance and financial risks. These risks could have an impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Our most significant risks are set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process seeks to identify and address significant risks. Our ERM process assesses, manages, and monitors risks consistent with the integrated risk framework in the\nEnterprise Risk Management - Integrated Framework (2017)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). We believe that risk-taking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our strategy. Our goal is to manage risks prudently rather than avoid risks. We can mitigate risks and their impact on the Company only to a limited extent.\nA team of senior executives prioritizes identified risks and assigns an executive to address each major identified risk area and lead action plans to manage risks. Our Board of Directors provides oversight of the ERM process and reviews significant identified risks. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors also reviews significant financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage them. Our other Board committees also play a role in risk management, as set forth in their respective charters.\nOur goal is to proactively manage risks using a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value. However, the risks set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other risks and uncertainties could adversely affect us and cause our results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.\nIndustry and Economic Risks\nWe face the potential harms of natural disasters, including those as a result of climate change, pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, acts of war, terrorism, international conflicts or other disruptions to our operations, the duration and severity of which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.\nOur business depends on the movement of people and goods around the world. Natural disasters (including but not limited to those as a result of climate change), pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, power outages, fires, explosions, equipment failures, sabotage, political instability and the actions taken by governments could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations, our suppliers or our customers, and could create economic instability. Disruptions to our IT infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, and other events, including disruptions at third party IT and other service providers, could also interfere with or disrupt our operations. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could decrease demand for our hardware and software products, solutions or services, increase our costs, or make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products, solutions or services.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to the global economy, including in all of the regions in which we, our suppliers, distributors, business partners and customers do business and in which our workforce is located. The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to manage it, including those by governmental authorities, have had, and could continue to have, significant impacts on global markets. While the duration and severity of those impacts on our business are highly uncertain, they have had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including, but not limited to, the following:\n•\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it have significantly limited or prevented the movement of goods and services worldwide, which has resulted in and could continue to result in disruptions in our supply chain and our difficulty in procuring or inability to procure components and materials necessary for our hardware and software products, solutions and services. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it has increased and could continue to increase the costs of making and distributing our hardware and software products, solutions and services or result in delays in delivering, or an inability to deliver, them to our customers.\n6\n•\nOur workforce may be unable or unwilling to work on-site or travel as a result of vaccine requirements, event cancellations, facility closures, shelter-in-place, travel and other restrictions and changes in industry practice, or if they, their co-workers or their family members become ill or otherwise require care arrangements. Regulations for vaccines and COVID-19 testing have been announced and additional regulations may be announced in the jurisdictions in which our business operates. These workforce disruptions and regulations have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our ability to efficiently operate, including to develop, manufacture, generate sales of, promote, market, and deliver our hardware and software products, solutions and services, and provide customer support. Implementation of new regulations for vaccines may result in attrition of skilled labor and impact our ability to attract and retain talent necessary for our business operations. For additional information, see the risk factor on attracting, developing, and retaining highly qualified personnel.\n•\nOur customers are, and continue to be, subject to significant risks and have had, and could continue to have, adverse impacts to their business operations and financial condition related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could lead to a decrease in their liquidity and/or industrial spending. This has resulted in, and could continue to result in, a decrease in demand for our hardware and software products, solutions and services, as well as impact our customers’ ability to pay for such hardware and software products, solutions and services.\nThe unprecedented and continuously evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic make the duration and severity of its impacts difficult to predict, which could limit our ability to respond to those impacts. Additionally, the impacts described above and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it could substantially increase the risk to us from the other risks described in this Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\n.\nAdverse changes in macroeconomic or industry conditions may result in decreases in our sales and profitability.\nWe are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur, we may experience reduced, canceled or delayed orders, payment delays or defaults, supply chain disruptions or other adverse events as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers.\nDemand for our hardware and software products, solutions and services is sensitive to changes in levels of industrial production and the financial performance of major industries that we serve. As economic activity slows, credit markets tighten, or sovereign debt concerns arise, companies tend to reduce their levels of capital spending, which could result in decreased demand for our hardware and software products, solutions and services.\nOil & Gas is a major industry that we serve. Demand for our hardware and software products, solutions and services is sensitive to industry volatility and risks including those related to commodity prices, supply and demand dynamics, productions costs, geological and political activities, and environmental regulations including those intended to reduce the impact of climate change. When adverse Oil & Gas industry events arise, companies may reduce their levels of spending, which could result in decreased demand for our hardware and software products, solutions and services.\nVolatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets may result in increased costs to maintain our capital structure.\nOur ability to access the credit markets and the costs of borrowing are affected by the strength of our credit rating and current market conditions. If our access to credit, including the commercial paper market, is adversely affected by a change in market conditions or otherwise, our cost of borrowings may increase or our ability to fund operations may be reduced.\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is the basis for determining the amount of our interest payments on borrowings under our $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR. Banks currently reporting information used to set U.S dollar LIBOR are currently expected to stop doing so during 2023. Various parties, including government agencies, are seeking to identify an alternative rate to replace LIBOR. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to amend certain agreements that use LIBOR as a benchmark and we cannot predict what alternative index or other amendments may be negotiated with our counterparties. As a result, our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Additionally, uncertainty as to the nature of a potential discontinuance or modification of LIBOR, alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially and adversely affect the trading market for securities linked to such benchmarks. For additional information, see\nFinancial Condition\nin Item 7.\nMD&A\n.\n7\nOur industry is highly competitive.\nWe face strong competition in all of our market segments in several significant respects. We compete based on breadth and scope of our hardware and software product portfolio and solution and service offerings, technology differentiation, the domain expertise of our employees and partners, product performance, quality of our hardware and software products, solutions and services, knowledge of integrated systems and applications that address our customers’ business challenges, pricing, delivery and customer service. The relative importance of these factors differs across the geographic markets and product areas that we serve and across our market segments. We seek to maintain competitive pricing levels across and within geographic markets by continually developing advanced technologies for new hardware and software products and product enhancements and offering complete solutions for our customers’ business problems. In addition, we continue to drive productivity to reduce our cost structure. If we fail to achieve our objectives, to keep pace with technological changes, or to provide high quality hardware and software products, solutions and services, we may lose business or experience price erosion and correspondingly lower sales and margins. We expect the level of competition to remain high in the future, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nWe rely on suppliers to provide equipment, components and services.\nOur business requires that we buy equipment, components and services including finished products, electronic components and commodities. Our reliance on suppliers involves certain risks, including:\n•\nshortages of components, commodities or other materials, which could adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies and ability to make timely delivery of our products, solutions and services;\n•\nchanges in the cost of these purchases due to inflation, exchange rate fluctuations, taxes, tariffs, commodity market volatility or other factors that affect our suppliers;\n•\npoor quality or an insecure supply chain, which could adversely affect the reliability and reputation of our hardware and software products, solutions and services;\n•\nembargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions that may affect our ability to purchase from various suppliers; and\n•\nintellectual property risks such as challenges to ownership of rights or alleged infringement by suppliers.\nAny of these uncertainties could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete. We also maintain several single-source supplier relationships because either alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations. Unavailability of, or delivery delays for, single-source components or products could adversely affect our ability to ship the related products in a timely manner. The effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with our higher volume and more profitable products. Even where substitute sources of supply are available, qualifying alternative suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or result in delays and a loss of sales.\nOur business success depends on attracting, developing, and retaining highly qualified personnel.\nOur success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees, and the effective implementation of processes and technology to increase employee engagement, productivity, and efficiency. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. Difficulty attracting, developing, and retaining members of our management team and key employees with the necessary expertise, including by offering attractive compensation, benefits, and development opportunities, could have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We continuously evaluate, modify, and enhance our internal processes and technologies to increase employee engagement, productivity, and efficiency, and to mitigate failure risks from older technologies currently in use. Failure to identify and successfully implement new processes and technologies could add costs and complications to ongoing operations and negatively impact employee engagement, productivity, and efficiency.\n8\nWe sell to customers around the world and are subject to the risks of doing business in many countries.\nWe do business in more than 100 countries around the world. Less than half of our total sales in 2021 were to customers outside the U.S. In addition, our manufacturing operations, suppliers and employees are located in many places around the world. The future success of our business depends in large part on growth in our sales in non-U.S. markets. Our global operations are subject to numerous financial, legal and operating risks, such as political and economic instability; prevalence of corruption in certain countries; enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights; and compliance with existing and future laws, regulations and policies, including those related to exports, imports, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions, investments, taxation, product content and performance, employment and repatriation of earnings. In addition, we are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, inflation rates and interest rates. The occurrence or consequences of these risks may make it more difficult to operate our business and may increase our costs, which could decrease our profitability and have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nFailures or security breaches of our products, connected services, manufacturing environment, supply chain, or information technology systems could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely heavily on information technology (IT) in our hardware and software products, solutions and services for customers, manufacturing environment, and in our enterprise infrastructure. Despite the implementation of security measures, our IT systems are vulnerable to unauthorized access by nation states, hackers, cyber-criminals, malicious insiders, and other actors who may engage in fraud, theft of confidential or proprietary information, or sabotage. Our systems could be compromised by malware (including ransomware), cyber attacks, and other events, ranging from widespread, non-targeted, global cyber threats to targeted advanced persistent threats. Given that our hardware and software products, solutions and services are used in critical infrastructure, these threats could indicate increased risk for our products, services, solutions, manufacturing, and IT infrastructure. Past global cyber attacks have also been perpetuated by compromising software updates in widely-used software products, increasing the risk that vulnerabilities or malicious content could be inserted into our products. In some cases, malware attacks were spread throughout the supply chain, moving from one company to the next via authorized network connections.\nOur hardware and software products, solutions, and services are used by our direct and indirect customers in applications that may be subject to information theft, tampering, sabotage, or cyber-attacks. Careless or malicious actors could cause a customer’s process to be disrupted or could cause equipment to operate in an improper manner that could result in harm to people or property. While we continue to improve the security attributes of our hardware and software products, solutions and services, we can reduce risk, not eliminate it. To a significant extent, the security of our customers’ systems depends on how those systems are designed, installed, protected, configured, updated and monitored, and much of this is typically outside our control. In addition, the software supply chain introduces security vulnerabilities into many products across the industry.\nOur business uses IT resources on a dispersed, global basis for a wide variety of functions including development, engineering, manufacturing, sales, accounting, and human resources. Our vendors, partners, employees and customers have access to, and share, information across multiple locations via various digital technologies. In addition, we rely on partners and vendors, including cloud providers, for a wide range of products and outsourced activities as part of our internal IT infrastructure and our commercial offerings. Secure connectivity is important to these ongoing operations. Also, our partners and vendors frequently have access to our confidential information as well as confidential information about our customers, employees, and others. We design our security architecture to reduce the risk that a compromise of our partners’ infrastructure, for example a cloud platform, could lead to a compromise of our internal systems or customer networks. In addition, our Third Party Risk Program manages risk posed by our suppliers that have access to our confidential information, systems, or network, but this risk cannot be eliminated and vulnerabilities at third parties could result in unknown risk exposure to our business and information.\nThe current cyber threat environment indicates increased risk for all companies, including those in industrial automation and information. Like other global companies, we have experienced cyber threats and incidents, although none have been material or had a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Our information security efforts, under the leadership of our Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Product Security Officer, with the support of the entire management team, include major programs designed to address security governance and risk, product security, identification and protection of critical assets, insider risk, third-party risk, security awareness, and cyber defense operations. We believe these measures reduce, but cannot eliminate, the risk of a cybersecurity incident. Any significant security incidents could have an adverse impact on sales, harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns.\n9\nAn inability to respond to changes in customer preferences could result in decreased demand for our products.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and offer hardware and software products that appeal to the changing needs and preferences of our customers in the various markets we serve. Developing new hardware and software products requires high levels of innovation, and the development process is often lengthy and costly. If we are not able to anticipate, identify, develop, and market products that respond to changes in customer preferences and emerging technological and broader industry trends, demand for our products could decline.\nThere are inherent risks in our solutions and services businesses.\nRisks inherent in the sale of solutions and services include assuming greater responsibility for successfully delivering projects that meet a particular customer specification, including defining and controlling contract scope, efficiently executing projects, and managing the performance and quality of our subcontractors and suppliers. If we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks, we could incur cost overruns, liabilities and other losses that would adversely affect\nour results of operations.\nWe rely on our distribution channel for a substantial portion of our sales.\nIn North America, a large percentage of our sales are through distributors. In certain other countries, the majority of our sales are also through a limited number of distributors. We depend on the capabilities and competencies of our distributors to sell our hardware and software products, solutions and services and deliver value to our customers. Disruptions to our existing distribution channel or the failure of distributors to maintain and develop the appropriate capabilities to sell our hardware and software products, solutions and services could adversely affect our sales. A disruption could result from the sale of a distributor to a competitor, financial instability of a distributor or other events.\nIntellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our customers.\nOthers may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers. We frequently provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties. Indemnification payments and legal expenses to defend claims could be costly.\nIn addition, we own the rights to many patents, trademarks, brand names and trade names that are important to our business. The inability to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Expenses related to enforcing our intellectual property rights could be significant.\nIncreasing employee benefit costs and funding requirements could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOne important aspect of attracting and retaining qualified personnel is continuing to offer competitive employee retirement and health care benefits. The expenses we record for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans depend on factors such as changes in market interest rates, the value of plan assets, mortality assumptions and healthcare trend rates. Significant unfavorable changes in these factors would increase our expenses and funding requirements. Expenses and funding requirements related to employer-funded healthcare benefits depend on laws and regulations, which could change, as well as healthcare cost inflation. An inability to control costs and funding requirements related to employee and retiree benefits could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\n10\nStrategic Transactions and Investments Risks\nFailure to identify, manage, complete, and integrate strategic transactions may adversely affect our business or we may not achieve the expected benefits of these transactions.\nAs part of our strategy, we may pursue strategic transactions, including acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, other business opportunities and purchases of technology from third parties. In order to be successful, we must identify attractive transaction opportunities, effectively complete the transaction, and manage post-closing matters, such as integration of the acquired business or technology (including related personnel) and cooperation with our joint venture and other strategic partners. We may not be able to identify or complete beneficial transaction opportunities given the intense competition for them. Even if we successfully identify and complete such transactions, we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions and we may not be able to successfully address risks and uncertainties inherent in such transactions, including:\n•\ndifficulties in integrating the purchased or new operations, technologies, products or services, retaining customers and achieving the expected benefits of the transaction, such as sales increases, access to technologies, cost savings and increases in geographic or product presence, in the desired time frames;\n•\nloss of key employees or difficulties integrating personnel;\n•\nlegal and compliance issues;\n•\ndifficulties implementing and maintaining consistent standards, financial systems, internal and other controls, procedures, policies and information systems;\n•\ndifficulties maintaining relationships with our joint venture and other strategic partners (including as a result of such joint venture and other strategic partners having differing business objectives) and managing disputes with such joint venture and other strategic partners that may arise in connection with our relationships with them; and\n•\ndiversion of management’s attention from other business concerns.\nFuture strategic transactions and technology investments could result in debt, dilution, liabilities, increased interest expense, restructuring charges, and impairment and amortization expenses related to intangible assets.\nWe own common stock in PTC Inc. and are exposed to the volatility, liquidity and other risks inherent in holding that stock.\nWe own common stock of PTC Inc. (PTC), a Nasdaq-listed company, that we acquired for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.0 billion. We present this investment on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at its fair value at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of our shares of PTC common stock (PTC Shares) is subject to fluctuation in the future due to the volatility of the stock market, changes in general economic conditions, and the performance of PTC. We recognize all changes in the fair value of the PTC Shares (whether realized or unrealized) as gains or losses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the PTC Shares can materially impact the earnings we report, which introduces volatility in our earnings that is not associated with the results of our business operations. In particular, significant declines in the fair value of the PTC Shares would produce significant declines in our reported earnings.\nWhile there is an established trading market for shares of PTC common stock, there are limitations on our ability to dispose of some or all of the PTC Shares should we wish to reduce our investment. Until September 2023, we are subject to contractual restrictions on our ability to transfer the PTC Shares, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to transfer the PTC Shares under the securities laws. Further, the reported value of the PTC Shares does not necessarily reflect their lowest current market price. If we were forced to sell some or all of the PTC Shares in the market, there can be no assurance that we would be able to sell them at prices equivalent to the value of the PTC Shares that we have reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices.\nFinally, our equity position in PTC is a minority position which exposes us to further risk as we are not able to exert control over PTC.\n11\nLegal, Tax and Regulatory Risks\nNew legislative and regulatory actions could adversely affect our business.\nLegislative and regulatory action, including those related to corporate income taxes or climate change, may be taken in the various countries and other jurisdictions where we operate that may affect our business activities in those countries and other jurisdictions or may otherwise increase our costs to do business. For example, we are increasingly required to comply with various environmental and other material, product, certification and labeling laws and regulations. Our customers may also be required to comply with such legislative and regulatory requirements. These requirements could increase our costs and could potentially have an adverse effect on our ability to do business in certain jurisdictions. Changes in these requirements could impact demand for our hardware and software products, solutions and services. Compliance with state, federal and foreign privacy regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), could increase our operating costs as part of our efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information. Failure to maintain information privacy could result in legal liability or reputational harm.\nIn addition, increased public awareness and concern regarding climate change may result in more requirements or expectations that could mandate more restrictive or expansive standards, such as more prescriptive reporting of environmental, social, and governance metrics. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate change legislation and standards, which creates uncertainty. While the Company has adopted certain voluntary targets, environmental laws, regulations, or standards may be changed, accelerated, or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company, its products, or customers, which could negatively impact the Company’s business, capital expenditures, results of operations, and financial condition.\nClaims from taxing authorities could have an adverse effect on our income tax expense and financial condition.\nWe conduct business in many countries, which requires us to interpret and comply with the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. Due to the ambiguity of tax laws among those jurisdictions as well as the uncertainty of how underlying facts may be construed, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. We must successfully defend any claims from taxing authorities to avoid an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nPotential liabilities and costs from litigation (including asbestos claims and environmental remediation) could reduce our profitability.\nVarious lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to the safety and security of the hardware and software products, solutions and services we sell, employment, contract matters, and environmental remediation.\nWe have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain of our products many years ago. Our products may also be used in hazardous industrial activities, which could result in product liability claims. The uncertainties of litigation (including asbestos claims) and the uncertainties related to the collection of insurance proceeds make it difficult to predict the ultimate resolution of these lawsuits.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental regulations concerning human health, the limitation and control of emissions and discharges into the air, ground, and water, the quality of air and bodies of water, and the handling, use and disposal of specified substances. Our financial responsibility to clean up contaminated property or for natural resource damages may extend to previously owned or used properties, waterways and properties owned by unrelated companies or individuals, as well as properties that we currently own and use, regardless of whether the contamination is attributable to prior owners. We have been named as a potentially responsible party at cleanup sites and may be so named in the future, and the costs associated with these current and future sites may be significant.\nWe have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. In connection with these divestitures, certain lawsuits, claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses, either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law. In some instances, the divested business has assumed the liabilities; however, it is possible that we might be responsible for satisfying those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so.\n12"

Our intelligent motor control offering can be integrated seamlessly with the Logix architecture.\nDomain expertise refers to the industry and application knowledge required to deliver solutions and services that support customers through the entire life cycle of their automation investment. The combination of industry-specific domain expertise of our people with our innovative technologies enables us to help our customers solve their manufacturing and business challenges.\nGlobal Expansion\nAs the manufacturing world continues to expand, we must be able to meet our customers’ needs around the world. Approximately 66 percent of our employees and less than half of our total sales are outside the U.S. We continue to expand our footprint in emerging markets.\nAs we expand in markets with considerable growth potential and shift our global footprint, we expect to continue to broaden the portfolio of hardware and software products, solutions and services that we provide to our customers in these regions. We have made significant investments to globalize our manufacturing, product development and customer-facing resources in order to be closer to our customers throughout the world. The emerging markets of Asia Pacific, including China and India, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe and Africa are projected to be the fastest growing over the long term, due to higher levels of infrastructure investment and the growing middle-class population. We believe that increased demand for consumer products in these markets will lead to manufacturing investment and provide us with additional growth opportunities in the future.\nEnhanced Market Access\nOver the past decade, our investments in technology and globalization have enabled us to expand our addressed market to over $90 billion. Our process initiative has been the most important contributor to this expansion and remains our largest growth opportunity.\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) represent another area of addressed market expansion and an important growth opportunity. To remain competitive, OEMs need to find the optimal balance of machine cost and performance while reducing their time to market. Our scalable integrated architecture and intelligent motor control offerings, along with design productivity tools and our motion and safety products, can assist OEMs in addressing these business needs.\nWe have developed a powerful network of channel partners, technology partners and commercial partners that act as amplifiers to our internal capabilities and enable us to serve our customers’ needs around the world.\n18\nBroad Range of Industries Served\nWe apply our knowledge of manufacturing applications to help customers solve their business challenges. We serve customers in a wide range of industries, which we group into three broad categories: discrete, hybrid, and process.\nOutsourcing and Sustainability Trends\nDemand for our hardware and software products, solutions and services across all industries benefits from the outsourcing and sustainability needs of our customers. Customers increasingly desire to outsource engineering services to achieve a more flexible cost base. Our manufacturing application knowledge enables us to serve these customers globally.\nWe help our customers meet their sustainability needs pertaining to energy efficiency, environmental, and safety goals. Customers across all industries are investing in more energy-efficient manufacturing processes and technologies, such as intelligent motor control, and energy-efficient solutions and services. In addition, environmental and safety objectives, including those related to combating climate change, often spur customers to invest to ensure compliance and implement sustainable business practices. As customers seek to be more sustainable, our offering of hardware and software products provide strategic opportunities to appeal to their changing needs and preferences.\nAcquisitions and Investments\nOur acquisition and investment strategy focuses on hardware and software products, solutions and services that will be catalytic to the organic growth of our core offerings.\nIn August 2021, we acquired Plex Systems (Plex), a cloud-native smart manufacturing platform. Plex offers a single-instance, multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service manufacturing platform operating at scale, including advanced manufacturing execution systems, quality, and supply chain management capabilities.\nIn December 2020, we acquired Fiix Inc., a privately-held, artificial intelligence enabled computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) company based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Fiix’s cloud-native CMMS creates workflows for the scheduling, organizing, and tracking of equipment maintenance; connects seamlessly to business systems; and drives data-driven decisions.\nIn October 2020, we acquired Oylo, a privately-held industrial cybersecurity services provider based in Barcelona, Spain. Oylo is dedicated to providing a broad range of industrial control system cybersecurity services and solutions including assessments, turnkey implementations, managed services and incident response.\nIn April 2020, we acquired ASEM, S.p.A. (ASEM), a provider of digital automation technologies. ASEM’s products will allow us to provide customers with a high degree of configurability for their industrial computing needs, allow them to achieve faster time to market, lower their cost of ownership, improve asset utilization, and better manage enterprise risk.\n19\nIn April 2020, we also acquired Kalypso, LP (Kalypso), a privately-held US-based software delivery and consulting firm specializing in the digital transformation of industrial companies with a strong client base in life sciences, consumer products and industrial high-tech. This acquisition enhances our ability to implement and deploy technology and deliver even greater value to our customers.\nIn January 2020, we acquired Avnet Data Security, LTD (Avnet), an Israel-based cybersecurity provider with over 20 years of experience providing cybersecurity services. Avnet’s combination of service delivery, training, research, and managed services enables us to service a much larger set of customers globally while also continuing to accelerate our portfolio development in this market.\nOn October 1, 2019, we completed the formation of a joint venture, Sensia, a fully integrated digital oilfield automation solutions provider. The joint venture leverages Schlumberger’s oil and gas domain knowledge and our automation and information expertise. Rockwell Automation owns 53% of Sensia and Schlumberger owns 47% of Sensia.\nIn October 2019, we also acquired MESTECH Services (MESTECH), a global provider of Manufacturing Execution Systems / Manufacturing Operations Management, digital solutions consulting, and systems integration services. The acquisition of MESTECH expands our capabilities to profitably grow information solutions and connected services globally and accelerate our ability to help our customers execute digital transformation initiatives.\nIn January 2019, we acquired Emulate3D, an innovative engineering software developer whose products digitally simulate and emulate industrial automation systems. This acquisition enables our customers to virtually test machine and system designs before incurring manufacturing and automation costs and committing to a final design.\nIn 2018, we made several investments, including in shares of PTC common stock (the “PTC Shares”). PTC is the leader in the Industrial Internet of Things and augmented reality. Our investment in and alliance with PTC is accelerating growth for both companies and enabling us to be the partner of choice for customers around the world who want to transform their physical operations with digital technology in order to achieve increased productivity, heightened plant efficiency, reduced operational risk and better system interoperability.\nWe believe these acquisitions and investments will help us expand our served market and deliver value to our customers.\nAttracting, Developing, and Retaining Highly Qualified Talent\nAt Rockwell Automation, we promise to expand human possibility within our company and throughout the world of industrial production, and we work to attract and develop highly engaged people who can and want to do their best work.\nOur commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion starts at the top. Our 11 board members, 10 of whom are independent, include three female and two African American directors. In fiscal year 2021, we hired our first chief diversity officer and made investments to accelerate our efforts to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion across the company.\nA culture of integrity is fundamental to Rockwell’s core values, including a formal ethics and compliance organization and an Ombuds office that investigates ethical and legal concerns brought forth by employees. In fiscal year 2020, we refreshed our code of conduct that along with our partner code of conduct and supplier code of conduct prohibits corrupt acts, bribery and anticompetitive behavior. Employee training is used to reinforce our values companywide, with participation in trainings related to ethics, environment, health and safety, and emergency responses at or near 100%.\n20\nThere are several ways in which we attract, develop, and retain highly qualified talent, including:\n•\nWe make the safety and health of our employees a top priority. We strive for zero workplace injuries and illnesses and operate in a manner that recognizes safety as fundamental to Rockwell Automation being a great place to work. In fiscal year 2021, we achieved 0.27 recordable cases per 100 employees.\n•\nWe capture and act upon employee feedback through our annual employee engagement survey. It measures several engagement indicators and drivers and provides an overall employee engagement index (EEI) with external benchmark comparison. The latest survey, conducted in February 2021, showed an EEI of 74, which was equal to a global norm for this index. Our global inclusion index score was 76, three points higher than the global benchmark of 73.\n•\nWe invest in growth and development of our employees. As the pace of change increases, it is important we provide re-skilling and upskilling opportunities for our technical talent, along with soft skills and leadership development for all. We offer a portfolio of all employee, managerial and leader training that spans on-demand self-paced and virtual live instructor-led formats. Our programs focus on basic as well as transformational skills. We take pride in our culture and in fiscal year 2021 created an opportunity for our employees to participate in team-based culture workshops. In fiscal 2021, the majority of our employees completed one or more of our training programs representing over 100,000 learning hours.\n•\nWe offer employee assistance and work life benefits to all global employees. Our comprehensive benefits include healthcare benefits, disability and life insurance benefits, paid time off, and leave programs. Rockwell offers plans and resources to help employees meet future savings goals through defined benefit and retirement savings plans. We offer flextime, remote work, and part-time arrangements whenever business conditions permit.\nWe monitor employee retention and attrition rates by demographic factors including by gender, ethnicity, generation, years of service, career role, region, business, and function. We generally experienced higher attrition rates in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020. We believe the increase is consistent with market trends experienced broadly across labor markets in fiscal 2021. We use attrition rate information to identify and address unfavorable trends to mitigate risk to our business. See Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nfor a discussion of risks relating to our inability to attract, develop, and retain highly qualified talent.\nAt September 30, 2021, our employees, including those employed by consolidated subsidiaries, by region were approximately:\nOur employees had the following global gender demographics:\n21\nOur U.S. employees had the following race and ethnicity demographics based on voluntary disclosure:\nContinuous Improvement\nProductivity and continuous improvement are important components of our culture. We have programs in place that drive ongoing process improvement, functional streamlining, material cost savings and manufacturing productivity. These are intended to improve profitability that can be used to fund investments in growth and to offset inflation. Our ongoing productivity initiatives target both cost reduction and improved asset utilization. Charges for workforce reductions and facility rationalization may be required in order to effectively execute our productivity programs.\n22\nU. S. Industrial Economic Trends\nIn 2021, sales in the U.S. accounted for over half of our total sales. The various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served U.S. markets include:\n•\nThe Industrial Production (IP) Index, published by the Federal Reserve, which measures the real output of manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities. The IP Index is expressed as a percentage of real output in a base year, currently 2017. Historically, there has been a meaningful correlation between the changes in the IP Index and the level of automation investment made by our U.S. customers in their manufacturing base.\n•\nThe Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which indicates the current and near-term state of manufacturing activity in the U.S. According to the ISM, a PMI measure above 50 indicates that the U.S. manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below 50 indicates that it is generally contracting.\nThe table below depicts the trends in these indicators from fiscal 2019 to 2021. These figures are as of the date of this filing and are subject to revision by the issuing organizations. The IP index continued to improve during the quarter, reaching the pre-pandemic level in August before declining below that level again in September. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, PMI continues to be well above 50. The September PMI represents the sixteenth consecutive month of expansion in the overall economy.\nNon-U.S. Economic Trends\nIn 2021, sales to customers outside the U.S. accounted for less than half of our total sales. These customers include both indigenous companies and multinational companies with a global presence. In addition to the global factors previously mentioned in the “Overview” section, international demand, particularly in emerging markets, has historically been driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region, investments in infrastructure and expanding consumer markets. We use changes in key countries' gross domestic product and IP as indicators of the growth opportunities in each region where we do business.\nIndustrial output and PMI outside the U.S. was mixed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Industrial output projections for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 are varied with some regions projected to grow sequentially and others projected to contract.\n23\nSupply Chain\nWe have a global supply chain, including a network of suppliers and distribution and manufacturing facilities. The supply chain is stressed by increased demand, along with pandemic-related and other global events that have put additional pressures on manufacturing output and freight lanes. This has resulted in and could continue to result in:\n•\ndisruptions in our supply chain;\n•\ndifficulty in procuring or inability to procure components and materials necessary for our hardware and software products, solutions and services;\n•\nincreased costs for commodities, components, and freight services; and\n•\ndelays in delivering, or an inability to deliver, our hardware and software products, solutions, and services.\nWe are closely managing our end-to-end supply chain, from sourcing to production to customer delivery, with a particular focus on all critical and at-risk suppliers and supplier locations globally.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nIn fiscal 2020, we experienced a significant disruption to our business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which impacted demand for our hardware and software products, services and solutions. In response to the pandemic we implemented enhanced policies and procedures for employee safety and we implemented temporary cost reduction actions and other adjustments to our cost structure. Restrictions on physical access to customer, manufacturing and office facilities has created and continues to create inefficiencies and execution delays.\nWe continue to monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies. Uncertainty on the duration and severity of those impacts remain as new variants of the virus have emerged and the evolving nature of vaccine roll-outs and regulations. New regulations for vaccines and COVID-19 testing and health and safety requirements have been announced and additional regulations may be announced in the jurisdictions in which our business operates. We are continuously responding to the changing conditions created by the pandemic and evolving regulations and remain focused on our priorities including employee health and safety, our customer needs, and protecting critical investments to drive long-term differentiation.\nWe have seen a recovery in demand for our hardware and software products, services, and solutions during fiscal 2021, allowing us to reverse our temporary cost reduction actions, and we expect this to continue into fiscal 2022. We continue to monitor and to respond to the impacts on our businesses from macroeconomic effects including the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, supply chain constraints, and materials and labor shortages.\nOutlook\nThe table below provides guidance for sales growth and earnings per share for fiscal 2022. Our guidance reflects strong demand as well as record backlog entering into fiscal year 2022. Supply chain challenges remain dynamic, and our projections assume gradual improvement over the course of the year.\n1\nOrganic sales growth and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP measures. See\nSupplemental Sales Information\nand\nAdjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation\nfor more information on these non-GAAP measures.\n2\nEstimate for incremental sales resulting from businesses acquired in fiscal year 2021.\n24\nSummary of Results of Operations\nThe following table reflects our sales and operating results (in millions, except per share amounts):\n(1)\nSee Note 19 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the definition of segment operating earnings.\n(2)\nTotal segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin are non-GAAP financial measures. We exclude purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, corporate and other, non-operating pension and postretirement benefit (cost) credit, gains and losses on investments, the $70 million legal settlement in fiscal 2021, valuation adjustments related to the registration of the PTC Shares in fiscal 2019, interest (expense) income - net, and income tax provision because we do not consider these costs to be directly related to the operating performance of our segments. We believe total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin are useful to investors as measures of operating performance. We use these measures to monitor and evaluate the profitability of our operating segments. Our measures of total segment operating earnings and total segment operating margin may be different from measures used by other companies.\n(3)\nAdjusted EPS is a non-GAAP earnings measure. See\nAdjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation\nfor more information on this non-GAAP measure.\n25\n2021 Compared to 2020\nSales\nSales in fiscal 2021 increased 10.5 percent compared to 2020. Organic sales increased 6.7 percent of which approximately 1 percent was due to pricing. Currency translation increased sales by 2.3 percentage points. Acquisitions increased sales by 1.5 percentage points. Organic annual recurring revenue (ARR) at September 30, 2021 grew approximately 18 percent compared to September 30, 2020. See\nOrganic Annual Recurring Revenue\nfor information on this measure.\nThe table below presents our sales, attributed to the geographic regions based upon country of destination, for the year ended September 30, 2021, and the percentage change from the same period a year ago (in millions, except percentages):\n(1)\nOrganic sales and organic sales growth exclude the effect of acquisitions, changes in currency exchange rates, and divestitures. See\nSupplemental Sales Information\nfor information on these non-GAAP measures.\n•\nReported and organic sales in North America increased in discrete and hybrid industries, partially offset by weakness in process industries, particularly Oil & Gas.\n•\nEMEA reported and organic sales increased primarily due to strength in Food & Beverage and Tire. Reported sales also increased due to currency translation and sales from acquisitions.\n•\nAsia Pacific reported and organic sales increased year over year, primarily due to strength in Semiconductor, Life Sciences, and Tire. Reported sales also increased due to favorable currency translation.\n•\nReported and organic sales in Latin America decreased year over year, primarily due to weakness in Mining and Oil & Gas, partially offset by growth in Food & Beverage.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and other expenses were $120.6 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $98.9 million in fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily driven by deal costs associated with the acquisition of Plex Systems.\nIncome before Income Taxes\nIncome before income taxes increased to $1,526.2 million in 2021 from $1,136.1 million in 2020, primarily due to fair-value adjustments recognized in 2021 and 2020 in connection with our investment in PTC (the “PTC adjustments”), higher operating earnings, and a $70 million pre-tax favorable legal settlement in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Total segment operating earnings increased to $1,391.3 million from $1,257.9 million in 2020, primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation and the reversal of temporary pay actions taken in fiscal 2020.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate in 2021 was 11.9 percent compared to 9.9 percent in 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the effect of tax benefits recognized upon the formation of the Sensia joint venture in fiscal 2020 and other discrete items. The Adjusted Effective Tax Rate in 2021 was 11.6 percent compared to 12.4 percent in 2020. The decrease in the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate was primarily due to higher discrete benefits in the current year.\nSee Note 16 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete reconciliation of the United States statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and more information on tax events in 2021 and 2020 affecting each year’s respective tax rates.\n26\nDiluted EPS and Adjusted EPS\nFiscal 2021 net income attributable to Rockwell Automation was $1,358.1 million or $11.58 per share, compared to $1,023.4 million or $8.77 per share in fiscal 2020. The increase in net income attributable to Rockwell Automation and diluted EPS were primarily due to higher sales and the PTC adjustments, partially offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation and the reversal of temporary pay actions taken in fiscal 2020. Adjusted EPS was $9.43 in fiscal 2021, up 19.8 percent compared to $7.87 in fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by the reinstatement of incentive compensation and the reversal of temporary pay actions taken in fiscal 2020.\nOperating Segments\nThe following is a discussion of our results by operating segment. See Note 19 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on each segment and our definition of segment operating earnings.\nIntelligent Devices\nSales\nIntelligent Devices sales increased 12.0 percent in 2021 compared to 2020.

Total segment operating earnings decreased 15 percent year over year from $1,473.6 million in 2019 to $1,257.9 million in 2020, primarily due to lower sales, partially offset by a combination of temporary and structural cost actions.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective tax rate in 2020 was 9.9 percent compared to 22.8 percent in 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the PTC adjustments, tax benefits recognizable upon the formation of the Sensia joint venture, and other discrete items. The Adjusted Effective Tax Rate in 2020 was 12.4 percent compared to 17.9 percent in 2019. The decrease in the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate was primarily due to our benefit from non-U.S. tax rates, tax benefits recognizable upon the formation of the Sensia joint venture, and other discrete items.\nSee Note 16 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete reconciliation of the United States statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and more information on tax events in 2020 and 2019 affecting each year’s respective tax rates.\n28\nDiluted EPS and Adjusted EPS\nFiscal 2020 net income attributable to Rockwell Automation was $1,023.4 million or $8.77 per share, compared to $695.8 million or $5.83 per share in fiscal 2019. The increase in net income attributable to Rockwell Automation and diluted EPS were primarily due to the PTC adjustments, partially offset by lower sales. Fiscal 2020 Adjusted EPS was $7.87, down 10.4 percent compared to $8.78 in fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower sales, partially offset by a combination of temporary and structural cost actions.\nOperating Segments\nThe following is a discussion of our results by operating segment. See Note 19 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on each segment and our definition of segment operating earnings.\nIntelligent Devices\nSales\nIntelligent Devices sales decreased 9.9 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. Organic sales decreased 8.8 percent and the effect of currency translation decreased sales by 1.1 percentage points. All regions experienced sales declines.\nSegment Operating Margin\nIntelligent Devices segment operating earnings decreased 15.7 percent. Operating margin was 19.9% percent in 2020 compared to 21.3% percent in 2019, primarily due to lower sales, partially offset by a combination of temporary and structural cost actions.\nSoftware & Control\nSales\nSoftware & Control sales decreased 6.1 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. Organic sales decreased 5.9 percent, the effect of currency translation decreased sales by 1.2 percentage points, and acquisitions increased sales by 1.0 percentage points. All regions experienced sales declines.\nSegment Operating Margin\nSoftware & Control segment operating earnings decreased 10.8 percent year over year. Segment operating margin was 28.2 percent in 2020 compared to 29.7 percent a year ago, primarily due to lower sales, partially offset by a combination of temporary and structural cost actions.\nLifecycle Services\nSales\nLifecycle Services sales increased 4.1 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. Organic sales decreased 7.8 percent, the effect of currency translation decreased sales by 1.4 percentage points, and acquisitions increased sales by 13.3 percentage points. Reported sales increased in all regions except Latin America, and all regions experienced organic sales declines.\nSegment Operating Margin\nLifecycle Services segment operating earnings decreased 20.0 percent year over year. Segment operating margin was 11.6 percent in 2020 compared to 15.1 percent a year ago, primarily due to lower organic sales and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by a combination of temporary and structural cost actions.\n29\nSupplemental Segment Information\nPurchase accounting depreciation and amortization and non-operating pension and postretirement benefit cost (credit) are not allocated to our operating segments because these costs are excluded from our measurement of each segment’s operating performance for internal purposes. If we were to allocate these costs, we would attribute them to each of our segments as follows (in millions):\n30\nAdjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation\nAdjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate are non-GAAP earnings measures that exclude non-operating pension and postretirement benefit cost (credit), purchase accounting depreciation and amortization attributable to Rockwell Automation, net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, and gains and losses on investments, including their respective tax effects. Non-operating pension and postretirement benefit cost (credit) is defined as all components of our net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost except for service cost. See Note 14 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost.\nBeginning in fiscal 2021, we changed our definition of Adjusted Income and Adjusted EPS to exclude the impact of purchase accounting depreciation and amortization attributable to Rockwell Automation, including the related tax effects. The definition of Adjusted Effective Tax Rate also changed to correspond to the purchase accounting items now being excluded from Adjusted Income. We believe these new definitions provide more useful information about our operating performance and allow management and investors to better compare our operating performance period over period, compared to our prior definitions of these measures given our increased inorganic investments. All previously reported amounts within this filing have been recast to conform to this new definition. Adjusted EPS is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation. Our measures of Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate may be different from measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for net income attributable to Rockwell Automation, diluted EPS and effective tax rate.\nThe following are reconciliations of net income attributable to Rockwell Automation, diluted EPS and effective tax rate to Adjusted Income, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, respectively (in millions, except per share amounts and percentages):\n1\nIncludes (gain) loss on investments and valuation adjustments related to the registration of PTC Shares.\n31\n1\nFiscal 2022 guidance excludes estimates of changes in fair value of investments on a forward-looking basis due to variability, complexity, and limited visibility of these items.\n2\nFiscal 2022 guidance based on Adjusted Income attributable to Rockwell, which includes an adjustment for Schlumberger's non-controlling interest in Sensia.\nOrganic Annual Recurring Revenue\nARR is a key metric that enables measurement of progress in growing our recurring revenue business. It represents the annual contract value of all active recurring revenue contracts at any point in time. Recurring revenue is defined as a revenue stream that is contractual, typically for a period of 12 months or more, and has a high probability of renewal. The probability of renewal is based on historical renewal experience of the individual revenue streams, or management's best estimates if historical renewal experience is not available. Organic ARR growth is calculated as the dollar change in ARR, adjusted to exclude the effects of currency translation and acquisitions, divided by ARR as of the prior period. The effects of currency translation are excluded by calculating Organic ARR on a constant currency basis. When we acquire businesses, we exclude the effect of ARR in the current period for which there was no comparable ARR in the prior period. Organic ARR growth is also used as a financial measure of performance for our annual incentive compensation. Because ARR is based on annual contract value, it does not represent revenue recognized during a particular reporting period or revenue to be recognized in future reporting periods and is not intended to be a substitute for revenue, contract liabilities, or backlog.\n32\nFinancial Condition\nThe following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (in millions):\nThe following table summarizes free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure (in millions):\nOur definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain our businesses’ operations and execute our strategy. Cash provided by continuing operating activities adds back non-cash depreciation expense to earnings but does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures. Our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations, if any. Operating, investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations, if any, are presented separately in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate our performance, including as a financial measure for our annual incentive compensation. Our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies.\nCash provided by operating activities was $1,261.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, compared to $1,120.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. Free cash flow was $1,140.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, compared to $1,006.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The year-over-year increase in cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were primarily due to higher pre-tax income, including the $70 million favorable legal settlement in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, and a decrease in incentive compensation payments, partially offset by higher working capital and income tax payments in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.\nWe repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program in 2021 at a total cost of $301.4 million and an average cost of $263.43 per share. In 2020, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at a total cost of $254.7 million and an average cost of $182.18 per share. At September 30, 2021, there were $1.8 million of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable that did not settle until 2022. At September 30, 2020, there were no outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable. Our decision to repurchase shares in 2022 will depend on business conditions, free cash flow generation, other cash requirements and stock price. On both September 6, 2018 and July 24, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized us to expend $1.0 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock. At September 30, 2021, we had approximately $552.3 million remaining for share repurchases under our existing board authorizations. See Item 5.\nMarket for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\n, for additional information regarding share repurchases.\n33\nWe expect future uses of cash to include working capital requirements, capital expenditures, additional contributions to our retirement plans, acquisitions of businesses and other inorganic investments, dividends to shareowners, repurchases of common stock and repayments of debt. We expect capital expenditures in 2022 to be approximately $165 million. Significant long-term uses of cash include the following (in millions):\n(a)\nThe amounts for long-term debt assume that the respective debt instruments will be outstanding until their scheduled maturity dates and include interest but exclude unamortized discount. See Note 7 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our long-term debt.\n(b)\nOur postretirement benefit plans are unfunded and are subject to change. Amounts reported are estimates of future benefit payments, to the extent estimable.\n(c)\nAmounts reported for pension funding contributions reflect current estimates. Contributions to our pension plans beyond 2022 will depend on future investment performance of our pension plan assets, changes in discount rate assumptions and governmental regulations in effect at the time. Amounts subsequent to 2022 are excluded from the summary above, as we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of these amounts. The minimum contribution for our U.S. pension plan as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is currently zero. We may make additional contributions to this plan at the discretion of management.\n(d)\nUnder the Tax Act, the Company may elect to pay the transition tax interest-free over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight.\nWe expect to fund future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances, cash generated by operating activities, commercial paper borrowings or a new issuance of debt or other securities. In addition, we have access to unsecured credit facilities with various banks.\nAt September 30, 2021, the majority of our cash and cash equivalents were held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. As a result of the broad changes to the U.S. international tax system under the Tax Act, in fiscal year 2018 we began to account for substantially all of our non-U.S. subsidiaries as being immediately subject to tax, while still concluding that earnings are indefinitely reinvested for a limited number of subsidiaries.\nOur short-term debt as of September 30, 2021, includes $484.0 million of commercial paper borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 0.18 percent and weighted average maturity period of 90 days. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2020. Also included in short-term debt as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 are $23.5 million of interest-bearing loans from Schlumberger to Sensia which were originally due September 30, 2020, and are now due December 31, 2021. The short-term loans from Schlumberger were entered into following formation of Sensia in fiscal 2020.\nIn August 2021, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of long-term notes in a registered public offering. The offering consisted of $600.0 million of 0.35% notes due in August 2023, $450.0 million of 1.75% notes due in August 2031, and $450.0 million of 2.80% notes due in August 2061, all issued at a discount. Net proceeds to the Company from the debt offering were $1,485.6 million. We used these net proceeds primarily to fund the acquisition of Plex. Refer to Note 4 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on this acquisition.\n34\nWe entered into treasury locks to manage the potential change in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance of the $1.5 billion aggregate notes in August 2021. These treasury locks were designated as and accounted for as cash flow hedges. As a result of the changes in the interest rates on the treasury locks between the time we entered into the treasury locks and the time we priced and issued the notes, the Company made a  net payment of $28.0 million to the counterparties. The $28.0 million net loss on the settlement of the treasury locks was recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, net of tax effect and is being amortized over the term of the corresponding notes as an adjustment to interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nIn April 2020, we entered into a $400.0 million senior unsecured 364-day term loan credit agreement and were advanced the full loan amount. Interest on these borrowings was based on short-term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings were outstanding. We repaid the $400.0 million term loan in September 2020.\nIn March 2019, we issued $1 billion aggregate principal amount of long-term notes in a registered public offering. The offering consisted of $425.0 million of 3.50% notes due in March 2029 (“2029 Notes”) and $575.0 million of 4.20% notes due in March 2049 (“2049 Notes”), both issued at a discount. Net proceeds to the Company from the debt offering were $987.6 million. We used these net proceeds primarily to repay our outstanding commercial paper, with the remaining proceeds used for general corporate purposes.\nWe entered into treasury locks to manage the potential change in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance of $1.0 billion of fixed rate debt in March 2019. Treasury locks are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The effective differentials paid on these treasury locks was initially recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, net of tax effect.\nAs a result of the changes in the interest rates on the treasury locks between the time we entered into the treasury locks and the time we priced and issued the 2029 Notes and 2049 Notes, the Company made a payment of $35.7 million to the counterparty on March 1, 2019. The $35.7 million loss on the settlement of the treasury locks was recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and is being amortized over the term of the 2029 Notes and 2049 Notes, and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nOn November 13, 2018, we replaced our former five-year $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a new five-year $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in November 2023. We can increase the aggregate amount of this credit facility by up to $750.0 million, subject to the consent of the banks in the credit facility. We did not incur early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the former credit facility. We did not borrow against the facility during the periods ended September 30, 2021 or 2020. Borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest based on short-term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding. This credit facility contains covenants under which we agree to maintain an EBITDA-to-interest ratio of at least 3.0 to 1.0. The EBITDA-to-interest ratio is defined in the credit facility as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the facility) for the preceding four quarters to consolidated interest expense for the same period.\nLIBOR is the primary basis for determining interest payments on borrowings under our $1.25 billion credit facility. Banks currently reporting information used to set U.S dollar LIBOR are currently expected to stop doing so during 2023. Various parties, including government agencies, are seeking to identify an alternative rate to replace LIBOR. We are monitoring their efforts, and we will likely seek to amend contracts to accommodate any replacement rate where one is not already provided.\nSeparate short-term unsecured credit facilities of approximately $230.8 million at September 30, 2021, were available to non-U.S. subsidiaries. Borrowings under our non-U.S. credit facilities at September 30, 2021 and 2020, were not significant. We were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities at September 30, 2021 and 2020. There are no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements under our credit facilities.\nAmong other uses, we can draw on our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. This access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the short-term credit ratings set forth in the table below. Under our current policy with respect to these ratings, we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility, if any, to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, as a result of the additional leverage added to fund the Plex acquisition, Standard & Poor’s elected to downgrade our Outlook from “Stable” to “Negative”. No changes were made to existing ratings by Moody’s or Fitch. The following is a summary of our credit ratings as of September 30, 2021:\n35\nOur ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit ratings and market conditions. Conditions in the commercial paper market have improved since the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected this market in March and April 2020, and we have not experienced any difficulty in accessing the commercial paper market. If our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facility to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under our unsecured committed credit facility could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings.\nWe regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.\nWe use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks. We enter into these contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain third-party and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years. We also use these contracts to hedge portions of our net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the U.S. dollar. In addition, we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans or other transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our entities’ functional currencies. Our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.\nCash dividends declared to shareowners were $497.5 million in 2021 ($4.28 per common share), $472.8 million in 2020 ($4.08 per common share) and $459.8 million in 2019 ($3.88 per common share). Our quarterly dividend rate as of September 30, 2021 is $1.07 per common share ($4.28 per common share annually), which is determined at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors.\nSupplemental Sales Information\nWe translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States using exchange rates effective during the respective period. Therefore, changes in currency exchange rates affect our reported sales. Sales by acquired businesses also affect our reported sales. We believe that organic sales, defined as sales excluding the effects of acquisitions and changes in currency exchange rates, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of acquisitions and changes in currency exchange rates. We use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and operating segment performance. When we acquire businesses, we exclude sales in the current period for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective period’s sales using the same currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior year. When we divest a business, we exclude sales in the prior period for which there are no comparable sales in the current period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year, excluding divestitures. We attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination.\n36\nThe following is a reconciliation of our reported sales by geographic region to organic sales (in millions):\nThe following is a reconciliation of our reported sales by operating segment to organic sales (in millions):\n37\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe believe the following accounting estimates are the most critical to the understanding of our financial statements as they could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. These estimates are based on our best judgment about current and future conditions, but actual results could differ from those estimates. Refer to Note 1 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our significant accounting policies.\nGoodwill - Sensia Reporting Unit\nThe quantitative test of goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. During the second quarter of 2021, we performed a quantitative impairment test for our Sensia reporting unit. We determined the fair value of the reporting unit under a combination of an income approach derived from discounted cash flows and a market multiples approach using selected comparable public companies.\nCritical assumptions used in this approach included management’s estimated future revenue growth rates, estimated future margins, and discount rate. Estimated future revenue growth and margins are based on management’s best estimate about current and future conditions. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates made were reasonable and appropriate, these estimates are based on a number of factors, including historical experience and information obtained from reporting unit management. Actual results and forecasts of revenue growth and margins for our Sensia reporting unit may be impacted by its concentration within the Oil & Gas industry and with its customer base.  Demand for Sensia hardware and software products, solutions and services is sensitive to industry volatility and risks, including those related to commodity prices, supply and demand dynamics, production costs, geological activity, and political activities. We determined the discount rate using our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risk factors specific to the reporting unit, with comparison to market and industry data. A hypothetical 10 percent decrease in the fair value of this reporting unit would not impact our conclusion that goodwill was not impaired.\nMore information regarding goodwill impairment testing is contained in Note 1 and Note 3 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAcquisitions - Plex Intangible Assets Valuation\nThe accounting for a business combination requires the excess of the purchase price for the acquisition over the net book value of assets acquired to be allocated to the identifiable assets of the acquired entity. Any unallocated portion is recognized as goodwill. We engaged an independent third-party valuation specialist to assist with the fair value allocation of the purchase price paid for the acquisition of Plex to intangible assets. This required the use of several assumptions and estimates including the customer attrition rate, forecasted cash flows attributable to existing customers, and the discount rate for the customer relationship intangible asset and the royalty rate, forecasted revenue growth rates, and the discount rate for the technology intangible asset. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates made were reasonable and appropriate, these estimates require judgment and are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from Plex management.\nThe key assumption requiring the use of judgement in the valuation of the customer relationship intangible asset was the customer attrition rate of 5 percent. This rate was selected based on historical experience and information obtained from Plex management. A change in the customer attrition rate of 250 basis points would result in a change of $63 million in intangible assets. The key assumptions requiring the use of judgement in the valuation of the technology intangible asset were the royalty rate of 25 percent and the obsolescence factor. The royalty rate was based on a detailed analysis considering the importance of the technology to the overall enterprise and market royalty data. A change in the royalty rate of 500 basis points would result in a change of $47 million in intangible assets. The obsolescence factor was calculated assuming phase out over ten years based on discussions with Plex management, the nature of the technology, its integration into customers’ manufacturing systems, and other third-party information for similar transactions. A two-year change in this assumption would result in a change of $52 million in intangible assets.\nMore information regarding this business combination is contained in Note 4 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n38\nRetirement Benefits — Pension\nPension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts, including the discount rate. Changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods.\nOur global pension expense in 2021 was $157.0 million compared to $130.9 million in 2020. Approximately 88 percent of our 2021 global pension expense and 75 percent of our global projected benefit obligation relate to our U.S. pension plan. The discount rate used to determine our 2021 U.S. pension expense was 2.90 percent, compared to 3.30 percent for 2020.\nFor 2022, our U.S. discount rate will increase to 3.10 percent from 2.90 percent in 2021. The discount rate was set as of our September 30 measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans.\nThe changes in our discount rate has an inverse relationship with our net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation. The following chart illustrates the estimated change in projected benefit obligation and annual net periodic benefit cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the discount rate for our U.S. pension plans (in millions):\n(1)\nChange includes both operating and non-operating pension costs.\nMore information regarding pension benefits is contained in Note 14 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\n—\nCustomer Incentives\nWe offer various incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account credits or additional hardware and software products, solutions and services based on meeting specified program criteria. Customer incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits. We record accruals at the time of revenue recognition as a current liability within Customer returns, rebates and incentives in our Consolidated Balance Sheet or, where a right of setoff exists, as a reduction of Receivables. Customer incentives for additional hardware and software products, solutions and services to be provided are considered distinct performance obligations. As such, we allocate revenue to them based on relative standalone selling price. Until the incentive is redeemed, the revenue is recorded as a contract liability.\nOur primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product. A critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for this program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed. Our estimate is based primarily on historical experience. If the time period were to change by 10 percent, the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately $14.2 million.\nMore information regarding our revenue recognition and returns, rebates and incentives policies are contained in Note 1 and Note 2 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAcquisitions - Sensia Joint Venture Intangible Assets Valuation\nWe recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the formation of Sensia based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date of October 1, 2019. The accounting for a business combination requires the excess of the purchase price for the acquisition over the net book value of assets acquired to be allocated to the identifiable assets of the acquired entity. Any unallocated portion is recognized as goodwill. We engaged an independent third-party valuation specialist to assist with the fair value allocation of the purchase price paid in connection with formation of the Sensia joint venture to intangible assets, which required the use of several assumptions and estimates. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates made were reasonable and appropriate, these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from Sensia management. The key assumption requiring the use of judgment was the customer attrition rates ranging from 7.5 percent to 25 percent. A change in the customer attrition rate of 250 basis points would result in a change of $40.4 million in intangible assets.\n39\nAcquisitions - Consolidation of Sensia Joint Venture\nOn October 1, 2019, we completed the formation of a joint venture, Sensia, a fully integrated digital oilfield automation solutions provider. Rockwell Automation owns 53 percent of Sensia and Schlumberger owns 47 percent of Sensia. We control Sensia and, as of October 1, 2019, have consolidated Sensia in our financial results. In determining whether to consolidate Sensia, U.S. GAAP requires that we evaluate our ability to control the significant financial and operating decisions of the joint venture. Determining the nature and extent of the noncontrolling interest holder's rights involves management judgment. We have evaluated the noncontrolling interest holder's rights and determined that we control and should consolidate Sensia in our financial results.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 in the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements.\n40"

    "text": "We are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities as well as derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. We sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in currencies other than a location’s functional currency. Our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. The fair value of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts is an asset of $14.1 million and a liability of $17.1 million at September 30, 2021. We enter into these contracts with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy.\nWe do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies has an unfavorable impact on our sales and results of operations. While future changes in foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to predict, our sales and profitability may be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to current levels.\nCertain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities. For such assets and liabilities without offsetting foreign currency forward exchange contracts, a 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would reduce our pre-tax income by approximately $2.2 million.\nWe record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them. The use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on these contracts will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings. For derivatives that are hedges, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We recognize the ineffective portion of a derivative’s change in fair value in earnings immediately. There was no impact on earnings due to ineffective hedges in 2021, 2020 or 2019. A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with the hedged exposures and related contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nIn addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities, we use a combination of short-term and long-term debt to finance operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations.\nOur short-term debt as of September 30, 2021, includes $484.0 million of commercial paper borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of 0.18 percent and weighted average maturity period of 90 days. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2020. Also included in short-term debt as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 are $23.5 million of interest-bearing loans from Schlumberger to Sensia which were originally due September 30, 2020, and are now due December 31, 2021. We have issued, and anticipate continuing to issue, short-term commercial paper obligations as needed. Changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations. A hypothetical 50 basis point increase in average market interest rates related to our short-term debt would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe had outstanding fixed rate long-term debt obligations with a carrying value of $3,464.6 million at September 30, 2021 and $1,974.7 million at September 30, 2020. The fair value of this debt was approximately $3,874.8 million at September 30, 2021 and $2,497.7 million at September 30, 2020. The potential increase in fair value on such fixed-rate debt obligations from a hypothetical 50 basis point decrease in market interest rates would not be significant to our results of operations or financial condition. We currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity and, therefore, fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners’ equity.\n41"

(“Rockwell Automation” or “the Company”)\nis a global leader in industrial automation and digital transformation. We connect the imaginations of people with the potential of technology to expand what is humanly possible, making the world more productive and more sustainable.\nBasis of Presentation\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP).\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and controlled majority-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates over which we do not have control but exercise significant influence are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. These affiliated companies are not material individually or in the aggregate to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We use estimates in accounting for, among other items, customer returns, rebates and incentives; allowance for doubtful accounts; excess and obsolete inventory; share-based compensation; acquisitions, including consolidation and intangible assets; goodwill impairment; product warranty obligations; retirement benefits; litigation, claims and contingencies, including environmental matters, conditional asset retirement obligations, and contractual indemnifications; leases; and income taxes. We account for changes to estimates and assumptions prospectively when warranted by factually-based experience.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn October 1, 2018, we adopted the new standard on revenue from contracts with customers using the modified retrospective method applied to contracts that were not completed as of October 1, 2018. See Note 2 for our revenue recognition policy under the new standard.\nWe recorded a net increase to opening retained earnings of $\n6.1\nmillion as of October 1, 2018, which reflects the cumulative impact of adopting the new standard. The primary drivers of the impact to retained earnings were changes to the capitalization and deferral of certain contract costs and the timing of revenue, net of costs, for software licenses bundled with services and projects previously accounted for on a completed contract basis. This impact was partially offset by a deferral of revenue, net of costs, related to the allocation of revenue to hardware and software products and services provided to our customers free of charge as incentives.\nReturns, Rebates and Incentives\nOur primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product. We also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account credits or additional hardware and software products, solutions and services based on meeting specified program criteria. Certain distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to contractual limitations.\nWe record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience. Returns are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as a right of return asset and refund liability. Incentives in the form of rebates are estimated at the individual customer level and are recorded as a reduction of sales. Customer incentives for additional hardware and software products, solutions and services to be provided are considered distinct performance obligations. As such, we allocate revenue to them based on relative standalone selling price. Until the incentive is redeemed, the revenue is recorded as a contract liability.\n47\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nTaxes on Revenue Producing Transactions\nTaxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue producing transactions, including sales, value added, excise and use taxes, are recorded on a net basis (excluded from revenue).\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include time deposits, certificates of deposit, and other fixed income securities with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.\nReceivables\nWe record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on customer-specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. Receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $\n13.2\nmillion at September 30, 2021 and $\n15.2\nmillion at September 30, 2020. In addition, receivables are recorded net of an allowance for certain customer returns, rebates and incentives of $\n6.7\nmillion at September 30, 2021 and $\n8.1\nmillion at September 30, 2020. The changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts during the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, were not material and primarily consisted of current-period provisions, write-offs charged against the allowance, recoveries collected, and foreign currency translation.\nInventories\nInventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost methods. Market is determined on the basis of estimated realizable values.\nInvestments\nInvestments include time deposits, certificates of deposit, other fixed income securities and equity securities. Investments with original maturities longer than three months at the time of purchase and less than one year from period end are classified as short-term. All other investments are classified as long-term. Fixed income securities meeting the definition of a security are accounted for as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. Equity securities are recorded at fair value. All other investments are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.\nProperty\nProperty, including internal-use software, is recorded at cost. Equipment under finance leases are stated at the present value of minimum lease payments. We calculate depreciation of property using the straight-line method over\n5\nto\n40\nyears for buildings and improvements,\n3\nto\n20\nyears for machinery and equipment and\n3\nto\n10\nyears for computer hardware and internal-use software. We capitalize significant renewals and enhancements and write off replaced units. Implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract are recorded in Other current assets and Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are amortized over the expected service period. We expense maintenance and repairs, as well as renewals of minor amounts. Property acquired during the year that is accrued within accounts payable or other current liabilities at year end is considered to be a non-cash investing activity and is excluded from cash used for capital expenditures in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nCapital expenditures of $\n31.5\nmillion, $\n27.2\nmillion and $\n26.4\nmillion were accrued within accounts payable and other current liabilities at September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n48\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and other intangible assets generally result from business acquisitions. We account for business acquisitions by allocating the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values; the excess of the purchase price over the allocated amount is recorded as goodwill.\nWe perform our annual evaluation of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment as required under U.S. GAAP during the second quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to results of operations. For our annual evaluation of goodwill, we may perform a qualitative test to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in order to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Our reporting units for goodwill evaluation consist of the Intelligent Devices segment, the Software & Control segment, the Lifecycle Services segment (excluding Sensia), and Sensia. When performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we determine the fair value of each reporting unit under a combination of an income approach derived from discounted cash flows and a market multiples approach using selected comparable public companies.\nSignificant assumptions used in the income approach include: management’s forecasted cash flows, including estimated future revenue growth rates and margins, discount rates, and terminal value. Forecasts of future revenue growth and margins are based on management’s best estimates. Actual results and forecasts of revenue growth and margins for our Sensia reporting unit may be impacted by its concentration within the Oil & Gas industry and with its customer base. Demand for Sensia hardware and software products, solutions, and services is sensitive to industry volatility and risks, including those related to commodity prices, supply and demand dynamics, production costs, geological activity, and political activities. Discount rates are determined using a weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risk factors specific to the reporting unit, with comparison to market and industry data. The terminal value is estimated following the common methodology of calculating the present value of estimated perpetual cash flow beyond the last projected period assuming constant discount and long-term growth rates. Significant assumptions used in the market multiples approach include selection of the comparable public companies and calculation of the appropriate market multiples.\nWe amortize certain customer relationships on an accelerated basis over the period of which we expect the intangible asset to generate future cash flows. We amortize all other intangible assets with finite useful lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Useful lives assigned range from\n3\nto\n15\nyears for trademarks,\n8\nto\n20\nyears for customer relationships,\n4\nto\n17\nyears for technology and\n10\nto\n30\nyears for other intangible assets.\nIntangible assets also include costs of software developed or purchased by our software business to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed. Amortization of these computer software products is calculated on a product-by-product basis as the greater of (a) the unamortized cost at the beginning of the year times the ratio of the current year gross revenue for a product to the total of the current and anticipated future gross revenue for that product or (b) the straight-line amortization over the remaining estimated economic life of the product.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the recorded amount of long-lived assets, including property, operating lease right-of-use assets, capitalized implementation costs of a cloud computing arrangement, and other intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. Impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount. If we determine that an asset is impaired, we measure the impairment to be recognized as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. We report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the recorded amount or fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair value using a discounted future cash flow analysis.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage certain foreign currency risks. We enter into these contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain third-party and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next two years. We also use these contracts to hedge portions of our net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the U.S. dollar. Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts to manage our borrowing\n49\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\ncosts of certain long-term debt and use treasury locks to manage the potential change in interest rates in anticipation of issuance of fixed rate debt. We designate and account for these derivative financial instruments as hedges under U.S. GAAP.\nFurthermore, we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges to offset transaction gains or losses associated with some of our assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans or other transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than our entities’ functional currencies. It is our policy to execute such instruments with global financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe record various financial instruments at fair value. U.S. GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. U.S. GAAP also classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:\nWe hold financial instruments consisting of cash and short-term debt. The fair values of our cash and short-term debt approximate their carrying amounts as reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheet due to the short-term nature of these instruments. We also hold financial instruments consisting of long-term debt, investments and derivatives. The valuation methodologies for these financial instruments are described in Notes 7, 10, 11, and 14.\nWe also determine fair value assessments in conjunction with intangible valuations of acquisitions and our annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. The valuation methodologies for these assets are described in Notes 3 and 4.\nThe methods described in these Notes may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nForeign Currency Translation\nWe translate assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange rates at the end of the respective period. We translate sales, costs and expenses at average exchange rates effective during the respective period. We report foreign currency translation adjustments as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Currency transaction gains and losses are included in results of operations in the period incurred.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe expense research and development (R&D) costs as incurred; these costs were $\n422.5\nmillion in 2021, $\n371.5\nmillion in 2020, and $\n378.9\nmillion in 2019. We include R&D expenses in cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for uncertain tax positions by determining whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated financial statements based on our assertion of the most likely outcome resulting from an examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes.\n50\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nEarnings Per Share\nWe present basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) amounts. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing earnings available to common shareowners, which is income excluding the allocation to participating securities, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year, excluding restricted stock. Diluted EPS amounts are based upon the weighted average number of common and common-equivalent shares outstanding during the year. We use the treasury stock method to calculate the effect of outstanding share-based compensation awards, which requires us to compute total employee proceeds as the sum of the amount the employee must pay upon exercise of the award and the amount of unearned share-based compensation costs attributed to future services. Share-based compensation awards for which the total employee proceeds of the award exceed the average market price of the same award over the period have an antidilutive effect on EPS, and accordingly, we exclude them from the calculation. Antidilutive share-based compensation awards for the years ended September 30, 2021 (\n0.2\nmillion shares), 2020 (\n1.6\nmillion shares), and 2019 (\n1.8\nmillion shares), were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation. U.S. GAAP requires unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid, to be treated as participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Our participating securities are composed of restricted stock and non-employee director restricted stock units.\nThe following table reconciles basic and diluted EPS amounts (in millions, except per share amounts):\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe recognize share-based compensation expense for equity awards on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date.\nProduct and Workers’ Compensation Liabilities\nWe record accruals for product and workers’ compensation claims in the period in which they are probable and reasonably estimable. Our principal self-insurance programs include product liability and workers’ compensation where we self-insure up to a specified dollar amount. Claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by insurance policies purchased from commercial insurers. We estimate the liability for the majority of the self-insured claims using our claims experience for the periods being valued.\n51\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe record liabilities for environmental matters in the period in which our responsibility is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We make changes to the liabilities in the periods in which the estimated costs of remediation change. At third-party environmental sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site, as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. If we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable and a right of setoff exists, we record the liability net of the estimated recovery. If we determine that recovery from insurers or other third parties is probable but a right of setoff does not exist, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation and a receivable for the estimated recovery. At environmental sites where we are the sole responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation. Ongoing operating and maintenance expenditures included in our environmental remediation obligations are discounted to present value over the probable future remediation period. Our remaining environmental remediation obligations are undiscounted due to subjectivity of timing and/or amount of future cash payments.\nConditional Asset Retirement Obligations\nWe record liabilities for costs related to legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible, long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional.\nLeases\nWe have operating leases primarily for real estate, vehicles, and equipment. We have finance leases primarily for equipment. We determine if a contract is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. A right-of-use (ROU) asset and a corresponding lease liability are recognized at commencement for contracts that are, or contain, a lease with an original term greater than 12 months. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the lease term, including periods for which renewal options are reasonably certain to be exercised, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term for leases with an original term of 12 months or less. Amortization expense of the ROU asset for finance leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense for finance leases is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate.\nSome leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage or may vary for other reasons, such as payments for insurance and tax payments. A portion of our real estate leases is generally subject to annual changes based upon an index. The changes based upon the index are treated as variable lease payments. The variable portion of lease payments is not included in our ROU assets or lease liabilities and is expensed when incurred. We elected to not separate lease and nonlease components of contracts for most underlying asset classes. Accordingly, all expenses associated with a lease contract are accounted for as lease expenses.\nLease liabilities are recognized at the contract commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. To calculate the lease liabilities we use our incremental borrowing rate. We determine our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date using our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for collateralization and lease term. For leases denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, the collateralized borrowing rate in the foreign currency is determined using the U.S. dollar and foreign currency swap spread. Long-term operating lease liabilities are presented as Operating lease liabilities and current operating lease liabilities are included in\nOther current liabilities\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Long-term finance lease liabilities are presented as\nLong-term debt\nand current finance lease liabilities are included in\nOther current liabilities\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nROU assets are recognized at the contract commencement date at the value of the related lease liability, adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received and initial direct costs incurred. Operating lease ROU assets are presented as Operating lease right-of-use assets and finance lease ROU assets are presented as Property in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nLease expenses, including amortization of ROU assets, for operating and finance leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Interest expense for finance leases is recorded in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n52\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard on accounting for leases that requires lessees to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for most leases, among other changes to existing lease accounting guidance. This standard also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures about leasing activities. We adopted this standard using the modified retrospective transition method, which resulted in an immaterial cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of October 1, 2019, our adoption date. The amount of lease ROU assets and corresponding lease liabilities recorded in the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet upon adoption were $\n316\nmillion and $\n329\nmillion, respectively. We have implemented necessary changes to accounting policies, processes, controls and systems to enable compliance with this standard.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued a new standard regarding the reporting of comprehensive loss, which gives entities the option to reclassify tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) stranded in accumulated other comprehensive loss into retained earnings. We adopted this standard as of October 1, 2019, and elected to reclassify tax effects of approximately $\n147\nmillion from accumulated other comprehensive loss into retained earnings.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard that requires companies to utilize a current expected credit losses impairment (CECL) model for certain financial assets, including trade and other receivables. The CECL model requires that estimated expected credit losses, including allowance for doubtful accounts, consider a broader range of information such as economic conditions and expected changes in market conditions. We adopted the new standard as of October 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nWe do not expect any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n2.\nRevenue Recognition\nNature of Products and Services\nSubstantially all of our revenue is from contracts with customers. We recognize revenue as promised products are transferred to, or services are performed for, customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products and services. Our offerings consist of industrial automation and information products, solutions and services.\nOur products include hardware, software, and configured-to-order products. Our solutions include custom-engineered systems and software. Our services include customer technical support and repair, asset management and optimization consulting, and training. Also included in our services is a portion of revenue related to spare parts that are managed within our services offering.\nOur operations are comprised of the Intelligent Devices segment, Software & Control segment, and Lifecycle Services segment. Revenue from the Intelligent Devices and Software & Control segments is predominantly comprised of product sales which are recognized at a point in time. The Software & Control segment also contains revenue from software products which may be recognized over time if certain criteria are met. Revenue from the Lifecycle Services segment is predominantly comprised of solutions and services which are primarily recognized over time. See Note 19 for more information.\nIn most countries, we sell primarily through independent distributors in conjunction with our direct sales force. We sell large systems and service offerings principally through our direct sales force, though opportunities are sometimes identified through distributors.\nPerformance Obligations\nWe use executed sales agreements and purchase orders to determine the existence of a customer contract.\nFor each customer contract, we determine if the products and services promised to the customer are distinct performance obligations. A product or service is distinct if both of the following criteria are met at contract inception: (i) the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other readily available resources, and (ii) our promise to transfer the product or perform the service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The fact that we regularly sell a product or service separately is an indicator that the customer can benefit from a product or service on its own or with other readily available resources.\n53\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe objective when assessing whether our promises to transfer products or perform services are distinct within the context of the contract is to determine whether the nature of the promise is to transfer each of those products or perform those services individually, or whether the promise is to transfer a combined item or items to which the promised products or services are inputs. If a promised product or service is not distinct, we combine that product or service with other promised products or services until it comprises a bundle of products or services that is distinct, which may result in accounting for all the products or services in a contract as a single performance obligation.\nFor each performance obligation in a contract, we determine whether the performance obligation is satisfied over time. A performance obligation is satisfied over time if it meets any of the following criteria: (i) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by our performance as we perform, (ii) our performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced, or (iii) our performance does not create an asset for which we have an alternative use and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. If one or more of these criteria are met, then we recognize revenue over time using a method that depicts performance. If none of the criteria are met, then control transfers to the customer at a point in time and we recognize revenue at that point in time.\nOur products represent standard, catalog products for which we have an alternative use, and therefore we recognize revenue at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer. For the majority of our products, control transfers upon shipment, though for some contracts control may transfer upon delivery. Our product revenue also includes revenue from software licenses. When these licenses are determined to be distinct performance obligations, we recognize the related revenue at a point in time when the customer is provided the right to use the license. Product-type contracts are generally one year or less in length.\nWe offer a wide variety of solutions and services to our customers, for which we recognize revenue over time or at a point in time based on the contract as well as the type of solution or service. If one or more of the three criteria above for over-time revenue recognition are met, we recognize revenue over time as cost is incurred, as work is performed, or based on time elapsed, depending on the type of customer contract. If none of these criteria are met, we recognize revenue at a point in time when control of the asset being created or enhanced transfers to the customer, typically upon delivery. More than half of our solutions and services revenue is from contracts that are one year or less in length. For certain solutions and services offerings, when we have the right to invoice our customers in an amount that corresponds to our performance completed to date, we apply the practical expedient to measure progress and recognize revenue based on the amount for which we have the right to invoice the customer.\nWhen assessing whether we have an alternative use for an asset, we consider both contractual and practical limitations. These include: (i) the level and cost of customization of the asset that is required to meet a customer’s needs, (ii) the activities, cost, and profit margin after any rework that would be required before the asset could be directed for another use, and (iii) the portion of the asset that could not be reworked for an alternative use.\nAt times we provide products and services free of charge to our customers as incentives when the customers purchase other products or services. These represent distinct performance obligations. As such, we allocate revenue to them based on relative standalone selling price.\nMost of our global warranties are assurance in nature and do not represent distinct performance obligations. See Note 9 for additional information and disclosures. We occasionally offer extended warranties to our customers that are considered a distinct performance obligation, to which we allocate revenue which is recognized over the extended warranty period.\nWe account for shipping and handling activities performed after control of a product has been transferred to the customer as a fulfillment cost. As such, we have applied the practical expedient and we accrue for the costs of shipping and handling activities if revenue is recognized before contractually agreed shipping and handling activities occur.\nUnfulfilled Performance Obligations\nAs of September 30, 2021, we expect to recognize approximately $\n655\nmillion of revenue in future periods from unfulfilled performance obligations from existing contracts with customers. We expect to recognize revenue of approximately $\n385\nmillion of our remaining performance obligations over the next\n12\nmonths with the remaining balance recognized thereafter.\nWe have applied the practical expedient to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original term of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue in proportion to the amount we have the right to invoice for services performed. The amounts above also do not include the impact of contract renewal options that are unexercised as of September 30, 2021.\n54\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nTransaction Price\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring products to, or performing services for, a customer. We estimate the transaction price at contract inception, and update the estimate each reporting period for any changes in circumstances. In some cases a contract may involve variable consideration, including rebates, credits, allowances for returns or other similar items that generally decrease the transaction price. We use historical experience to estimate variable consideration, including any constraint.\nThe transaction price (including any discounts and variable consideration) is allocated between separate products and services based on their relative standalone selling prices. The standalone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which we separately sell each good or service. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate the standalone selling price using available information such as market reference points and other observable data.\nWe have elected the practical expedient to exclude sales taxes and other similar taxes from the measurement of the transaction price.\nSignificant Payment Terms\nOur standard payment terms vary globally but do not result in a significant delay between the timing of invoice and payment. We occasionally negotiate other payment terms during the contracting process. We do not typically include significant financing components in our contracts with customers. We have elected the practical expedient to not adjust the transaction price for the period between transfer of products or performance of services and customer payment if expected to be one year or less.\nFor most of our products, we invoice at the time of shipment and we do not typically have significant contract balances. For our solutions and services as well as some of our products, timing may differ between revenue recognition and billing. Depending on the terms agreed to with the customer, we may invoice in advance of performance or we may invoice after performance. When revenue recognition exceeds billing we recognize a receivable, and when billing exceeds revenue recognition we recognize a contract liability.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregation by geographic region for our\nthree\noperating segments (in millions). We attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination. Information for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, has been recast to reflect our new operating segments. See Note 19 for further information on our change in operating segments.\n55\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nContract Balances\nContract liabilities primarily relate to consideration received in advance of performance under the contract. We do not have significant contract assets as of September 30, 2021.\nBelow is a summary of our contract liabilities balance:\nThe most significant changes in our contract liabilities balance during the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 were due to amounts billed, partially offset by revenue recognized that was included in the contract liabilities balance at the beginning of the period.\nIn the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, we recognized revenue of approximately $\n256.1\nmillion that was included in the opening contract liabilities balance. We did\nno\nt have a material amount of revenue recognized in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, from performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in previous periods.\nCosts to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract\nWe capitalize and amortize certain incremental costs to obtain and fulfill contracts. These costs primarily consist of incentives paid to sales personnel, which are considered incremental costs to obtain customer contracts. We elected the practical expedient to expense incremental costs to obtain a contract when the contract has a duration of one year or less for most classes of contracts. Our capitalized contract costs, which are included in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, are not significant. There was no impairment loss in relation to capitalized costs in the period.\n3.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill were (in millions):\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we changed our organizational structure resulting in\nthree\noperating segments: Intelligent Devices, Software & Control, and Lifecycle Services. This change also resulted in the identification of new reporting units. We reassigned our goodwill balances to reflect this new structure using the relative fair value allocation approach required under U.S. GAAP. Under this approach, the fair values of each of our new reporting units were compared to the total fair value of their prior respective reporting units immediately prior to the reorganization to arrive at the reassigned goodwill balances. We determined the reporting unit fair values using the same approach for quantitative goodwill impairment tests described in Note 1, and these values are considered level 3 measurements under the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy. We also tested goodwill at the affected reporting units for impairment prior to and subsequent to the reassignment of goodwill and concluded that goodwill was not impaired.\n56\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nWe performed our annual evaluation of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment during the second quarter of 2021 and concluded that these assets were\nno\nt impaired. We also assessed the changes in events and circumstances subsequent to our annual test and concluded that a triggering event which would require interim quantitative testing has not occurred. Refer to Note 1 for additional information on our annual impairment evaluation.\nOther intangible assets consist of (in millions):\nSoftware products represent costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed. Software products amortization expense was $\n11.9\nmillion in 2021, $\n10.2\nmillion in 2020 and $\n10.4\nmillion in 2019. Estimated total amortization expense for all amortized intangible assets is $\n112.0\nmillion in 2022, $\n110.6\nmillion in 2023, $\n107.6\nmillion in 2024, $\n105.3\nmillion in 2025 and $\n103.7\nmillion in 2026.\n57\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n4.\nAcquisitions\nFiscal 2021 Acquisitions\nPlex acquisition\nIn August 2021, we acquired Plex Systems, a cloud-native smart manufacturing platform. Plex offers a single-instance, multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service manufacturing platform operating at scale, including advanced manufacturing execution systems, quality, and supply chain management capabilities.\nWe recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with this acquisition based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date of August 31, 2021.\nThe preliminary aggregate purchase price allocation is as follows (in millions):\nIntangible assets identified include $\n276.4\nmillion of customer relationships, $\n232.8\nmillion of technology, and $\n22.2\nmillion of trade names (approximately\n12-year\nweighted average useful life). We assigned the full amount of goodwill and all other assets acquired to our Software & Control segment. The goodwill recorded represents intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. This goodwill arises because the purchase price for Plex reflects a number of factors including the future earnings and cash flow potential of the business, the strategic fit and resulting synergies from the complementary portfolio of leading software-as-a-service applications, industry expertise, and market access. We do not expect the goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes. The intangible assets were valued using an income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method and multi-period excess earnings method. The relief from royalty method calculates value based on hypothetical payments that would be saved by owning an asset rather than licensing it. The multi-period excess earnings method is the isolation of cash flows from a single intangible asset and measures fair value by discounting them to present value. These values are considered level 3 measurements under the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy. The key assumption requiring the use of judgement in the valuation of the customer relationship intangible asset was the customer attrition rate of\n5\npercent; other assumptions included forecasted cash flows attributable to the existing customers and the discount rate. The key assumptions requiring the use of judgement in the valuation of the technology intangible asset were the royalty rate of\n25\npercent and the obsolescence factor estimating a phase out over\n10\nyears; other assumptions included forecasted revenue growth rates and the discount rate.\n58\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOther acquisitions\nIn October 2020, we acquired Oylo, a privately-held industrial cybersecurity services provider based in Barcelona, Spain. We assigned the full amount of goodwill related to this acquisition to our Lifecycle Services segment.\nIn December 2020, we acquired Fiix Inc., a privately-held, artificial intelligence enabled computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) company based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We assigned the full amount of goodwill related to this acquisition to our Software & Control segment.\nWe recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with these acquisitions based on their estimated fair values as of the respective acquisition dates.\nThe preliminary aggregate purchase price allocation for these acquisitions is as follows (in millions):\nIntangible assets identified include $\n69.6\nmillion of customer relationships, technology, and trade names (approximately\n11\n-year weighted average useful life). We assigned $\n12.8\nmillion of goodwill to our Lifecycle Services segment and $\n212.0\nmillion of goodwill to our Software & Control segment, which represents intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. We do not expect the goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes.\nThe allocation of the purchase price to identifiable assets for all of the preceding acquisitions are based on the preliminary valuations performed to determine the fair value of the net assets as of their respective acquisition dates. The measurement period for the valuation of net assets acquired ends as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but not to exceed 12 months following the acquisition date. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to net assets acquired during the periods in which the adjustments are determined.\nThe total sales included in our consolidated results for all of the preceding acquisitions for the year ended September 30, 2021, were approximately $\n27.9\nmillion.\nPro forma consolidated sales for the year ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, were approximately $\n7.2\nbillion and $\n6.5\nbillion, respectively, and the impact on earnings is not material. The preceding pro forma consolidated financial results of operations are as if all of preceding fiscal 2021 acquisitions occurred on October 1, 2019. The pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved had the transaction occurred as of that time.\nAcquisition-related costs recorded as expenses for all of the preceding acquisitions in the year ended September 30, 2021, were not material.\n59\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nFiscal 2020 Acquisitions\nSensia joint venture\nOn October 1, 2019, we completed the formation of a joint venture, Sensia, a fully integrated digital oilfield automation solutions provider. Rockwell Automation owns\n53\n% of Sensia and Schlumberger owns\n47\n% of Sensia. As part of the transaction, we made $\n247.0\nmillion of net cash payments to Schlumberger, which were funded by cash on hand. We control Sensia and, as of October 1, 2019, have consolidated Sensia in our financial results. As part of the joint venture operations, Sensia regularly transacts with Schlumberger, primarily relating to purchases and sales of goods and services. These transactions are not material to Rockwell Automation for the year ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.\nWe recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the formation of Sensia based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date of October 1, 2019.\nThe preliminary purchase price allocation is as follows (in millions):\nIntangible assets assigned include $\n254.1\nmillion of customer relationships, technology, and trade names (approximately\n11-year\nweighted average useful life). We assigned the full amount of goodwill and all other assets acquired to our Lifecycle Services segment. The majority of the goodwill recorded is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The assets were valued using an income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method and multi-period excess earnings method. The relief from royalty method calculates value based on hypothetical payments that would be saved by owning an asset rather than licensing it. The multi-period excess earnings method is the isolation of cash flows from a single intangible asset and measures fair value by discounting them to present value. These values are considered level 3 measurements under the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy. Key assumptions used in the valuation of these intangible assets included: (1) a discount rate of\n11\n%, (2) the estimated remaining life of technology and trademarks of from\n5\nto\n15\nyears, and (3) the customer attrition rate ranging from\n7.5\n% to\n25\n%.\nThe fair value of the noncontrolling interest of the contributed business upon acquisition was $\n293.8\nmillion. The consolidated value of Sensia at October 1, 2019, was recorded at fair value for Schlumberger's contribution and at carrying value for Rockwell Automation's contribution.\nThe total incremental sales resulting from the Sensia joint venture included in our consolidated results for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, were approximately $\n191.0\nmillion.\n60\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOther acquisitions\nIn October 2019, we acquired MESTECH Services (MESTECH), a global provider of Manufacturing Execution Systems / Manufacturing Operations Management, digital solutions consulting, and systems integration services. We assigned the full amount of goodwill related to this acquisition to our Lifecycle Services segment.\nIn January 2020, we acquired Avnet Data Security, LTD (Avnet), an Israel-based cybersecurity provider with over\n20\nyears of experience providing cybersecurity services. We assigned the full amount of goodwill related to this acquisition to our Lifecycle Services segment.\nIn April 2020, we acquired ASEM, S.p.A. (ASEM), a leading provider of digital automation technologies. We assigned the full amount of goodwill related to this acquisition to our Software & Control segment.\nIn April 2020, we also acquired Kalypso, LP (Kalypso), a privately-held U.S.-based software delivery and consulting firm specializing in the digital transformation of industrial companies with a strong client base in life sciences, consumer products and industrial high-tech. We assigned the full amount of goodwill related to this acquisition to our Lifecycle Services segment.\nWe recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with these acquisitions based on their estimated fair values as of the respective acquisition dates.\nThe preliminary aggregate purchase price allocation for these acquisitions is as follows (in millions):\nIntangible assets assigned include $\n76.5\nmillion of customer relationships, technology, and trade names (approximately\n10\n-year weighted average useful life). We assigned $\n161.2\nmillion of goodwill to our Software & Control segment and $\n83.3\nmillion of goodwill to our Lifecycle Services segment. Approximately $\n69.0\nmillion of the goodwill recorded is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The purchase consideration includes $\n25.8\nmillion of contingent consideration held in an escrow account and recorded in other assets as restricted cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe total sales included in our consolidated results from these four acquisitions for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, were approximately $\n41.8\nmillion.\nThe allocation of the purchase price to identifiable assets for all of the preceding acquisitions are based on the preliminary valuations performed to determine the fair value of the net assets as of the acquisition date. The measurement period for the valuation of net assets acquired ends as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but not to exceed 12 months following the acquisition date. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to net assets acquired during the periods in which the adjustments are determined.\n61\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nPro forma consolidated sales for the year ended September 30, 2019, are approximately $\n7.0\nbillion, and the impact on earnings is not material. The preceding pro forma consolidated financial results of operations are as if all of the preceding fiscal 2020 acquisitions occurred on October 1, 2018. The pro forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved had the transaction occurred as of that time.\nAcquisition-related costs recorded as expenses for all of the preceding acquisitions in the year ended September 30, 2020, were not material.\n5.\nInventories\nInventories consist of (in millions):\n6.\nProperty, net\nProperty consists of (in millions):\n7.\nLong-term and Short-term Debt\nLong-term debt consists of (in millions):\n62\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOur short-term debt as of September 30, 2021, includes $\n484.0\nmillion of commercial paper borrowings with a weighted average interest rate of\n0.18\npercent. There were\nno\ncommercial paper borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2020. Also included in short-term debt as of September 30, 2021, and 2020, are $\n23.5\nmillion of interest-bearing loans from Schlumberger to Sensia, which were originally due September 30, 2020, and are now due December 31, 2021. The short-term loans from Schlumberger were entered into following formation of Sensia in fiscal 2020.\nIn August 2021, we issued $\n1.5\nbillion aggregate principal amount of long-term notes in a registered public offering. The offering consisted of $\n600.0\nmillion of\n0.35\n% notes due in August 2023, $\n450.0\nmillion of\n1.75\n% notes due in August 2031, and $\n450.0\nmillion of\n2.80\n% notes due in August 2061, all issued at a discount. Net proceeds to the Company from the debt offering were $\n1,485.6\nmillion. We used these net proceeds primarily to fund the acquisition of Plex. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on this acquisition.\nWe entered into treasury locks to manage the potential change in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance of the $\n1.5\nbillion aggregate notes in August 2021. These treasury locks were designated as and accounted for as cash flow hedges. As a result of the changes in the interest rates on the treasury locks between the time we entered into the treasury locks and the time we priced and issued the notes, the Company made a net payment of $\n28.0\nmillion to the counterparties. The $\n28.0\nmillion net loss on the settlement of the treasury locks was recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, net of tax effect, and is being amortized over the term of the corresponding notes, and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nIn April 2020, we entered into a $\n400.0\nmillion senior unsecured\n364-day\nterm loan credit agreement and were advanced the full loan amount. Interest on these borrowings was based on short-term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings were outstanding. We repaid the $\n400.0\nmillion term loan in September 2020.\nIn March 2019, we issued $\n1\nbillion aggregate principal amount of long-term notes in a registered public offering. The offering consisted of $\n425.0\nmillion of\n3.50\n% notes due in March 2029 (“2029 Notes”) and $\n575.0\nmillion of\n4.20\n% notes due in March 2049 (“2049 Notes”), both issued at a discount. Net proceeds to the Company from the debt offering were $\n987.6\nmillion. We used these net proceeds primarily to repay our outstanding commercial paper, with the remaining proceeds used for general corporate purposes.\nWe entered into treasury locks to manage the potential change in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance of $\n1.0\nbillion of fixed rate debt in March 2019. Treasury locks are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The effective differentials paid on these treasury locks was initially recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, net of tax effect.\nAs a result of the changes in the interest rates on the treasury locks between the time we entered into the treasury locks and the time we priced and issued the 2029 Notes and 2049 Notes, the Company made a payment of $\n35.7\nmillion to the counterparty on March 1, 2019. The $\n35.7\nmillion loss on the settlement of the treasury locks was recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss and is being amortized over the term of the 2029 Notes and 2049 Notes, and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nOn November 13, 2018, we replaced our former\nfive-year\n$\n1.0\nbillion unsecured revolving credit facility with a new\nfive-year\n$\n1.25\nbillion unsecured revolving credit facility expiring in November 2023. We can increase the aggregate amount of this credit facility by up to $\n750.0\nmillion, subject to the consent of the banks in the credit facility. We did not incur early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the former credit facility. We did\nno\nt borrow against the facility during the periods ended September 30, 2021 or 2020. Borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest based on short-term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding. This credit facility contains covenants under which we agree to maintain an EBITDA-to-interest ratio of at least\n3.0\nto 1.0. The EBITDA-to-interest ratio is defined in the credit facility as the ratio of consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the facility) for the preceding four quarters to consolidated interest expense for the same period.\nInterest payments were $\n91.8\nmillion during 2021, $\n101.7\nmillion during 2020 and $\n97.5\nmillion during 2019.\nThe following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of long-term debt not recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (in millions):\nWe base the fair value of long-term debt upon quoted market prices for the same or similar issues and therefore consider this a Level 2 fair value measurement. The fair value of long-term debt considers the terms of the debt excluding the impact of derivative and hedging activity. Refer to Note 1 for further information regarding levels in the fair value hierarchy.\n63\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n8.\nOther Current Liabilities\nOther current liabilities consist of (in millions):\n9.\nProduct Warranty Obligations\nWe record a liability for product warranty obligations at the time of sale to a customer based upon historical warranty experience. Most of our products are covered under a warranty period that runs for\ntwelve months\nfrom either the date of sale or installation. We also record a liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and reasonably estimable.\nChanges in product warranty obligations were (in millions):\n10.\nInvestments\nOur investments consist of (in millions):\n(1)\nShort-term investments are included in other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n64\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nEquity Securities\nOn July 19, 2018, we purchased\n10,582,010\nshares of PTC Inc. (“PTC”) common stock (the “PTC Shares”) in a private placement at a purchase price of $\n94.50\nper share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $\n1.0\nbillion. The PTC Shares are considered equity securities. On May 11, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the securities purchase agreement with PTC, which amended, among other things, our entity-specific transfer restrictions through September 2023, subject to certain exceptions. We have the ability to transfer in open market transactions, in the aggregate in any\n90\n-day period, a number of PTC Shares equal to up to\n1.0\npercent of PTC's total outstanding shares of common stock as of the first day in such\n90\n-day period. We also have the ability to transfer in marketed underwritten public offerings, in the aggregate in any\none-year\nperiod, a number of PTC Shares equal to up to\n5.0\npercent of PTC's total outstanding shares of common stock as of the closing date of the first such offering.\nThe PTC Shares are classified as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy and recognized at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet using the most recent closing price of PTC common stock quoted on Nasdaq. At September 30, 2021, the fair value of the PTC Shares was $\n1,267.6\nmillion, which was recorded in long-term investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We recorded a gain of $\n392.3\nmillion and $\n153.9\nmillion related to the PTC Shares in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRefer to Note 1 for further information regarding levels in the fair value hierarchy. We did not have any transfers between levels of fair value measurements during the periods presented.\n11.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe use foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency denominated debt obligations to manage certain foreign currency risks. We also use interest rate swap contracts and treasury locks to manage risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. The following information explains how we use and value these types of derivative instruments and how they impact our consolidated financial statements.\nAdditional information related to the impacts of cash flow hedges on other comprehensive income (loss) is included in Note 12.\nTypes of Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate variability in the expected future cash flows associated with certain third-party and intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies forecasted to occur within the next\ntwo years\n(cash flow hedges). We report in other comprehensive income (loss) the effective portion of the gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that we designate and that qualify as cash flow hedges. We reclassify these gains or losses into earnings in the same periods when the hedged transactions affect earnings. To the extent forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are ineffective, changes in value are recorded in earnings through the maturity date. There was no impact on earnings due to ineffective cash flow hedges. At September 30, 2021, we had a U.S. dollar-equivalent gross notional amount of $\n800.2\nmillion of foreign currency forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. We entered into treasury locks to manage the potential change in interest rates in anticipation of the issuance of $\n1.5\nbillion and $\n1.0\nbillion of fixed rate debt in August 2021 and March 2019, respectively. Treasury locks are accounted for as cash flow hedges since they hedge the risk of an increase in treasury rates for the forecasted interest payments of an anticipated fixed-rate debt issuance.\nThe pre-tax amount of gains (losses) recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) related to cash flow hedges that would have been recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations had they not been so designated was (in millions):\n65\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe pre-tax amount of gains (losses) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into the Consolidated Statement of Operations related to derivative forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges, which offset the related gains and losses on the hedged items during the periods presented, was (in millions):\nApproximately $\n0.1\nmillion of pre-tax net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges as of September 30, 2021 will be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months. We expect that these net unrealized gains will be offset when the hedged items are recognized in earnings.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe use foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency denominated debt obligations to hedge portions of our net investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries (net investment hedges) against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of foreign currency balances to the U.S. dollar. For all instruments that are designated as net investment hedges and meet effectiveness requirements, the net changes in value of the designated hedging instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareowners’ equity where they offset gains and losses recorded on our net investments globally. To the extent forward exchange contracts or foreign currency denominated debt designated as net investment hedges are ineffective, changes in value are recorded in earnings through the maturity date. There was no impact on earnings due to ineffective net investment hedges. At September 30, 2021, we had\nno\nforeign currency forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges.\nThe pre-tax amount of (losses) gains recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) related to net investment hedges that would have been recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations had they not been so designated was (in millions):\nFair Value Hedges\nWe used interest rate swap contracts to manage the borrowing costs of certain long-term debt. In February 2015, we issued $\n600.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate notes. Upon issuance of these notes, we entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted these notes from fixed rate debt to floating rate debt. We designated these contracts as fair value hedges because they hedged the changes in fair value of the fixed rate notes resulting from changes in interest rates. The changes in value of these fair value hedges were recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and are offset by the losses or gains on the underlying debt instruments, which are also recorded in interest expense. In May 2020, we settled all outstanding interest rate swaps and received $\n22.0\nmillion from the counterparties. This gain on the settlement of the interest rate swaps was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the 2025 Notes and is being amortized over the remaining term of those notes as an adjustment to interest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nThe pre-tax amount of net gains recognized within the Consolidated Statement of Operations related to derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, which fully offset the related net gains and losses on the hedged debt instruments during the periods presented, was (in millions):\n66\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nCertain of our locations have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies. We enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts that we do not designate as hedging instruments to offset the transaction gains or losses associated with some of these assets and liabilities. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments for which we do not elect hedge accounting are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in each period, based on the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments. At September 30, 2021, we had a U.S. dollar-equivalent gross notional amount of $\n1,011.5\nmillion of foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments.\nThe pre-tax amount of gains (losses) from forward exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations was (in millions):\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments\nWe recognize all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We value our forward exchange contracts using a market approach. We use a valuation model based on inputs including forward and spot prices for currency and interest rate curves. We did not change our valuation techniques during fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019. It is our policy to execute such instruments with major financial institutions that we believe to be creditworthy and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We diversify our foreign currency forward exchange contracts among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. Our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are usually denominated in curre\nncies of major industrial countries. The U.S. dollar-equivalent gross notional amount of our forward exchange contracts totaled $\n1,811.7\nmillion at September 30, 2021. Currency pairs (buy/sell) comprising the most significant contract notional values were Euro/United States dollar (USD), USD/Canadian dollar, USD/Mexican peso, and USD/Swiss franc.\nThe fair value of our derivatives and their location in our Consolidated Balance Sheet were (in millions):\nRefer to Note 1 for further information regarding levels in the fair value hierarchy.\n67\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n12.\nShareowners’ Equity\nCommon Stock\nAt September 30, 2021, the authorized stock of the Company consisted of\none billion\nshares of common stock, par value $\n1.00\nper share, and\n25\nmillion shares of preferred stock, without par value. At September 30, 2021,\n16.0\nmillion shares of authorized common stock were reserved for various incentive plans.\nChanges in outstanding common shares are summarized as follows (in millions):\nAt September 30, 2021, there were $\n1.8\nmillion of outstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable. At September 30, 2020, there were\nno\noutstanding common stock share repurchases recorded in accounts payable.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nChanges in accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable to Rockwell Automation by component were (in millions):\n68\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive loss to the Consolidated Statement of Operations were (in millions):\n(1) These components are included in the computation of net periodic benefit costs. See Note 14 for further information.\n69\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n13.\nShare-Based Compensation\nDuring 2021, 2020, and 2019, we recognized $\n51.7\nmillion, $\n46.1\nmillion and $\n43.1\nmillion of pre-tax share-based compensation expense, respectively. The total income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense was $\n8.6\nmillion, $\n7.7\nmillion, and $\n6.9\nmillion during 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We recognize compensation expense on grants of share-based compensation awards on a straight-line basis over the service period of each award recipient. As of September 30, 2021, total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation awards was $\n69.0\nmillion, net of estimated forfeitures, which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of approximately\n2.0\nyears.\nDuring 2020, we adopted, and our shareowners approved, our 2020 Long-Term Incentives Plan (“2020 Plan”), which replaced our 2012 Long-Term Incentives Plan, as amended (“2012 Plan”) and our 2003 Directors Stock Plan, as amended (“Directors Plan”). Our 2020 Plan authorizes us to deliver up to\n13.0\nmillion shares of our common stock upon exercise of stock options, upon grant, or in payment of stock appreciation rights, performance shares, performance units, restricted stock units or restricted stock. Our Directors Plan authorized us to deliver up to\n0.5\nmillion shares of our common stock upon exercise of stock options, upon grant, or in payment of restricted stock units. Shares relating to awards under our 2012 Plan that terminate by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation or otherwise without the issuance or delivery of shares or that are settled in cash in lieu of shares will be available for further awards under the 2020 Plan. Approximately\n11.4\nmillion shares under our 2020 Plan remain available for future grant or payment at September 30, 2021. We use treasury stock to deliver shares of our common stock under these plans. Our 2020 Plan does not permit share-based compensation awards to be granted after February 4, 2030.\nStock Options\nWe have granted non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase our common stock under various incentive plans at prices equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant dates. The exercise price for stock options granted under the plans may be paid in cash, already-owned shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and such shares. Stock options expire\nten years\nafter the grant date and vest ratably over\nthree years\n.\nThe per-share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, was $\n55.50\n, $\n35.80\n, and $\n32.46\n, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was\n$\n108.4\nmillion\n, $\n151.6\nmillion, and $\n35.8\nmillion during 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nWe estimated the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model and the following assumptions:\nThe average risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury security rates corresponding to the expected term in effect as of the grant date. The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend as a percentage of the market value of our common stock as of the grant date. We determined expected volatility using daily historical volatility of our stock price over the most recent period corresponding to the expected term as of the grant date. We determined the expected term of the stock options using historical data adjusted for the estimated exercise dates of unexercised options.\n70\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nA summary of stock option activity for the year ended September 30, 2021, is as follows:\nThe amount of options expected to vest is materially consistent with those outstanding and not yet exercisable.\nPerformance Share Awards\nCertain officers and key employees are also eligible to receive shares of our common stock in payment of performance share awards granted to them. Grantees of performance shares will be eligible to receive shares of our common stock depending upon our total shareowner return, assuming reinvestment of all dividends, relative to the performance of companies in the S&P 500 Index over a\nthree-year\nperiod for the awards granted in fiscal 2020 and 2019. The number of shares actually earned for awards granted in fiscal 2020 and 2019 will range from\nzero percent\nto\n200\npercent of the targeted number of performance shares for the three-year performance periods and will be paid, to the extent earned, in the fiscal quarter following the end of the applicable\nthree-year\nperformance period. Beginning with the awards granted in fiscal 2021, the total shareowner return is measured relative to the performance of companies in the following S&P 500 Selected GICS groups: Capital Goods, Software and Services, and Technology Hardware and Equipment. The number of shares actually earned for awards granted in fiscal 2021 will range from\n50\npercent to\n200\npercent of the targeted number of performance shares for the three-year performance periods and will be paid, to the extent earned, in the fiscal quarter following the end of the applicable\nthree-year\nperformance period.\nA summary of performance share activity for the year ended September 30, 2021, is as follows:\n(1)\nPerformance shares granted assuming achievement of performance goals at target.\n(2)\nAdjustments were due to the number of shares vested under fiscal 2018 awards at the end of the\nthree-year\nperformance period ended September 30, 2020, being lower than the target number of shares.\nThe following table summarizes information about performance shares vested during the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n71\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nFor the\nthree-year\nperformance period ending September 30, 2021, the payout will be\n144\n% of the target number of shares, with a maximum of approximately\n68,000\nshares to be delivered in payment under the awards in December 2021.\nThe per-share fair value of performance share awards granted during the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, was $\n298.10\n, $\n265.04\nand $\n155.04\n, respectively, which we determined using a Monte Carlo simulation and the following assumptions:\nThe average risk-free interest rate is based on the three-year U.S. Treasury security rate in effect as of the grant date. The expected dividend yield is based on the expected annual dividend as a percentage of the market value of our common stock as of the grant date. The expected volatilities were determined using daily historical volatility for the most recent\nthree-year\nperiod as of the grant date.\nRestricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\nWe grant restricted stock and restricted stock units to certain employees, and non-employee directors may elect to receive a portion of their compensation in restricted stock units. Restrictions on employee restricted stock and employee restricted stock units generally lapse over periods ranging from\none\nto\nfive years\n. Director restricted stock units generally are payable upon retirement. We value restricted stock and restricted stock units at the closing market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The weighted average fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards granted during the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, was $\n265.32\n, $\n200.36\nand $\n170.75\n, respectively. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, was $\n10.4\nmillion, $\n8.7\nmillion, and $\n7.8\nmillion, respectively.\nA summary of restricted stock and restricted stock unit activity for the year ended September 30, 2021, is as follows:\nWe also granted approximately\n5,600\nshares of unrestricted common stock to non-employee directors during the year ended September 30, 2021. The weighted average grant date fair value of the unrestricted stock awards granted during the years ended September 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, was $\n228.80\n, $\n171.51\nand $\n182.39\n, respectively.\n72\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n14.\nRetirement Benefits\nWe sponsor funded and unfunded pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans for our employees. The pension plans provide for monthly pension payments to eligible employees after retirement. Pension benefits for salaried employees generally are based on years of credited service and average earnings. Pension benefits for hourly employees are primarily based on specified benefit amounts and years of service. Effective July 1, 2010, we closed participation in our U.S. and Canada pension plans to employees hired after June 30, 2010. Employees hired after June 30, 2010 are instead eligible to participate in defined contribution plans. Effective October 1, 2010, we also closed participation in our U.K. pension plan to employees hired after September 30, 2010 and these employees are now eligible for a defined contribution plan. Benefits to be provided to plan participants hired before July 1, 2010 or October 1, 2010, respectively, are not affected by these changes. Our policy with respect to funding our pension obligations is to fund at a minimum the amount required by applicable laws and governmental regulations. We were not required to make contributions to satisfy minimum funding requirements in our U.S. pension plans in 2021, 2020 or 2019. We did\nno\nt make voluntary contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan in 2021 and 2019. We made a voluntary contribution of $\n50.0\nmillion to our U.S. qualified pension plan in 2020.\nWe sponsor various defined contribution savings plans that allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their income in accordance with plan specific guidelines. We contribute to savings plans and/or will match a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits. The Company contributions to defined contribution plans are based on age and years of service and range from\n3\n% to\n7\n% of eligible compensation. However, effective from May 2020 through November 2020, we temporarily suspended the 401(k) matching contribution for all U.S. employees to address the then-current and anticipated economic conditions resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic. Expense related to these plans was $\n58.5\nmillion in 2021, $\n50.9\nmillion in 2020, and $\n53.1\nmillion in 2019.\nOther postretirement benefits are primarily in the form of retirement medical plans that cover certain employees in the U.S. and Canada and provide for the payment of certain medical costs of eligible employees and dependents after retirement. The postretirement benefit plan was closed to employees hired after December 31, 2004.\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost (income) are (in millions):\nThe service cost component is included in Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. All other components are included in Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n73\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nSignificant assumptions used in determining net periodic benefit cost (income) are (in weighted averages):\nNet Benefit Obligation\nBenefit obligation, plan assets, funded status and net liability information is summarized as follows (in millions):\n74\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe actuarial gains recorded within the benefit obligation in 2021 were primarily the result of an increase in the discount rate for the U.S. Plans, which increased from\n2.90\n% in 2020 to\n3.10\n% in 2021. The actuarial losses recorded in 2020 were primarily the result of a decrease in the discount rate for the U.S. Plans, which decreased from\n3.30\n% in 2019 to\n2.90\n% in 2020. Approximately\n75\npercent of our 2021 global projected benefit obligation relates to our U.S. pension plan.\nAmounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, which have not yet been recognized in net periodic benefit cost are as follows (in millions):\nDuring 2021, we recognized prior service credits of $\n35.8\nmillion ($\n29.9\nmillion net of tax) and net actuarial losses of $\n142.5\nmillion ($\n108.3\nmillion net of tax) in pension and other postretirement net periodic benefit cost, which were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at September 30, 2020.\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans was $\n4,393.0\nmillion and $\n4,638.1\nmillion at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nInformation regarding our pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of plan assets (underfunded plans) are as follows (in millions):\nInformation regarding our pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of plan assets (underfunded plans) are as follows (in millions):\nSignificant assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations are (in weighted averages):\n(1)\nThe health care cost trend rate reflects the estimated increase in gross medical claims costs. As a result of the plan amendment adopted effective October 1, 2002, our effective per person retiree medical cost increase is\nzero\npercent beginning in 2005 for the majority of our postretirement benefit plans. For our other plans, we assume the gross health care cost trend rate will remain at\n6.00\n% in 2022 and decrease to\n5.00\n% in 2025 for U.S. Plans and will not change in future periods for Non-U.S. Plans.\n75\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nEstimated Future Payments\nWe expect to contribute $\n57.4\nmillion related to our global pension plans and $\n5.8\nmillion to our postretirement benefit plans in 2022.\nThe following benefit payments, which include employees’ expected future service, as applicable, are expected to be paid (in millions):\nPlan Assets\nIn determining the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, we consider actual returns on plan assets over the long term, adjusted for forward-looking considerations, such as inflation, interest rates, equity performance and the active management of the plan’s invested assets. We also considered our current and expected mix of plan assets in setting this assumption. This resulted in the selection of the weighted average long-term rate of return on assets assumption.\nOur global weighted-average targeted and actual asset allocations at September 30, by asset category, are:\nThe investment objective for pension funds related to our defined benefit plans is to meet the plan’s benefit obligations, while maximizing the long-term growth of assets without undue risk. We strive to achieve this objective by investing plan assets within target allocation ranges and diversification within asset categories. Target allocation ranges are guidelines that are adjusted periodically based on ongoing monitoring by plan fiduciaries. Investment risk is controlled by rebalancing to target allocations on a periodic basis and ongoing monitoring of investment manager performance relative to the investment guidelines established for each manager.\nAs of September 30, 2021 and 2020, our pension plans do not directly own our common stock.\nIn certain countries where we operate, there are no legal requirements or financial incentives provided to companies to pre-fund pension obligations. In these instances, we typically make benefit payments directly from cash as they become due, rather than by creating a separate pension fund.\nThe valuation methodologies used for our pension plans’ investments measured at fair value are described as follows. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at September 30, 2021 and 2020.\nCommon stock — Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.\nMutual funds — Valued at the net asset value (NAV) reported by the fund.\nCorporate debt — Valued at either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flow approach that maximizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks.\n76\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nGovernment securities — Valued at the most recent closing price on the active market on which the individual securities are traded or, absent an active market, utilizing observable inputs such as closing prices in less frequently traded markets.\nCommon collective trusts — Valued at the NAV as determined by the custodian of the fund. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities then divided by the number of units outstanding.\nPrivate equity and alternative equity — Valued at the estimated fair value, as determined by the respective fund manager, based on the NAV of the investment units held at year end, which is subject to judgment.\nReal estate funds — Consists of the real estate funds, which provide an indirect investment into a diversified and multi-sector portfolio of property assets. Publicly-traded real estate funds are valued at the most recent closing price reported on the SIX Swiss Exchange. The remainder is valued at the estimated fair value, as determined by the respective fund manager, based on the NAV of the investment units held at year end, which is subject to judgment.\nInsurance contracts — Valued at the aggregate amount of accumulated contribution and investment income less amounts used to make benefit payments and administrative expenses which approximates fair value.\nOther — Consists of other fixed income investments and common collective trusts with a mix of equity and fixed income underlying assets. Other fixed income investments are valued at the most recent closing price reported in the markets in which the individual securities are traded, which may be infrequently.\nRefer to Note 1 for further information regarding levels in the fair value hierarchy.\nIn accordance with ASC Subtopic 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the line items presented in the consolidated financial statements.\n77\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe following table presents our pension plans’ investments measured at fair value as of September 30, 2021:\n78\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe following table presents our pension plans’ investments measured at fair value as of September 30, 2020:\n79\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe table below sets forth a summary of changes in fair market value of our pension plans’ Level 3 assets for the year ended September 30, 2021:\nThe table below sets forth a summary of changes in fair market value of our pension plans’ Level 3 assets for the year ended September 30, 2020:\n15.\nOther Income (Expense)\nThe components of other income (expense) are (in millions):\n80\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n16.\nIncome Taxes\nSelected income tax data (in millions):\nEffective Tax Rate Reconciliation\nThe reconciliation between the U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective tax rate was:\n(a)\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we reversed our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets associated with the change in fair value of the PTC Shares. This resulted in a decrease to the effective tax rate of\n1.7\n% and\nno\nremaining valuation allowance related to PTC Shares, as described further in the table below.\nWe operate in certain non-U.S. tax jurisdictions under government-sponsored tax incentive programs, which may be extended if certain additional requirements are met. The program which generates the primary benefit has been extended to expire in 2032. The tax benefit attributable to these programs was $\n61.2\nmillion ($\n0.52\nper diluted share) in 2021, $\n59.1\nmillion ($\n0.51\nper diluted share) in 2020 and $\n55.1\nmillion ($\n0.46\nper diluted share) in 2019.\n81\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nDeferred Taxes\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to our net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) were (in millions):\nWe believe it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets through the reduction of future taxable income, other than for the deferred tax assets reflected below.\nTax attributes and related valuation allowances at September 30, 2021 were (in millions):\n82\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nA reconciliation of our gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows (in millions):\nThe amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits that would reduce our effective tax rate if recognized was $\n4.3\nmillion, $\n25.5\nmillion and $\n19.9\nmillion at September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAccrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were $\n1.5\nmillion and $\n4.0\nmillion at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. Benefits (expense) recognized were $\n2.5\nmillion, ($\n0.7\n) million and ($\n0.8\n) million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe believe it is reasonably possible that the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by up to $\n4.2\nmillion in the next 12 months as a result of the resolution of tax matters in various global jurisdictions and the lapses of statutes of limitations. If all of the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized, the net reduction to our income tax provision, including the recognition of interest and penalties and offsetting tax assets, could be up to $\n5.7\nmillion.\nWe conduct business globally and are routinely audited by the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years before 2018 and are no longer subject to state, local and non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2014.\nIncome tax liabilities of $\n264.8\nmillion and $\n296.0\nmillion related to the U.S. transition tax under the Tax Act that are payable greater than 12 months from September 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively, are recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n17.\nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities\nEnvironmental Matters\nFederal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the environment have and will continue to have an effect on our manufacturing operations. Thus far, compliance with environmental requirements and resolution of environmental claims have been accomplished without material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have been designated as a potentially responsible party at\n14\nSuperfund sites, excluding sites as to which our records disclose no involvement or as to which our potential liability has been finally determined and assumed by third parties. In addition, various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been asserted against us seeking remediation of alleged environmental impairments, principally at previously owned properties.\nBased on our assessment, we believe that our expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements. Environmental remediation cost liabilities, net of related expected recoveries, were $\n53.6\nmillion and $\n59.2\nmillion as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n83\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nConditional Asset Retirement Obligations\nWe accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal operation of the long-lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional. Identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities. We estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using site-specific knowledge and historical industry expertise. There have been no significant changes in liabilities incurred, liabilities settled, accretion expense or revisions in estimated cash flows for the periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. Conditional asset retirement obligations, net of related expected recoveries, were $\n23.6\nmillion and $\n22.8\nmillion as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOther Matters\nVarious other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product liability, environmental, safety and health, intellectual property, employment and contract matters. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to us, we believe the disposition of matters that are pending or have been asserted will not have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The following outlines additional background for obligations associated with asbestos, divested businesses and intellectual property.\nWe (including our subsidiaries) have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago, including products from divested businesses for which we have agreed to defend and indemnify claims. Currently there are a few thousand claimants in lawsuits that name us as defendants, together with hundreds of other companies. But in all cases, for those claimants who do show that they worked with our products or products of divested businesses for which we are responsible, we nevertheless believe we have meritorious defenses, in substantial part due to the integrity of the products, the encapsulated nature of any asbestos-containing components, and the lack of any impairing medical condition on the part of many claimants. We defend those cases vigorously. Historically, we have been dismissed from the vast majority of these claims with no payment to claimants.\nAdditionally, we have maintained insurance coverage that includes indemnity and defense costs, over and above self-insured retentions, for many of these claims. We believe these arrangements will provide substantial coverage for future defense and indemnity costs for these asbestos claims throughout the remaining life of asbestos liability. The uncertainties of asbestos claim litigation make it difficult to predict accurately the ultimate outcome of asbestos claims. That uncertainty is increased by the possibility of adverse rulings or new legislation affecting asbestos claim litigation or the settlement process. Subject to these uncertainties and based on our experience defending asbestos claims, we do not believe these lawsuits will have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses. In connection with these divestitures, certain lawsuits, claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us related to the period that we owned the businesses, either because we agreed to retain certain liabilities related to these periods or because such liabilities fall upon us by operation of law. In some instances the divested business has assumed the liabilities; however, it is possible that we might be responsible to satisfy those liabilities if the divested business is unable to do so. We do not believe these liabilities will have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn many countries we provide a limited intellectual property indemnity as part of our terms and conditions of sale and at times in other contracts with third parties. As of September 30, 2021, we were not aware of any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible of an unfavorable outcome. Historically, claims that have been made under the indemnification agreements have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations; however, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in a particular period. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we reached a favorable settlement agreement regarding litigation of a trademark infringement and false advertising matter and received $\n70\nmillion. The settlement gain is recorded in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n18.\nLeases\nWe have operating leases primarily for real estate, vehicles and equipment. We have finance leases primarily for equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms from less than\none year\nto approximately\n16\nyears.\n84\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nWe elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard on accounting for leases, which allows the Company to carry forward the historical assessments of whether contracts are, or contain, leases, lease classification and initial direct costs. We also elected to not record lease ROU assets or lease liabilities for leases with an original term of 12 months or less. We elected to use the remaining lease term for purposes of calculating the incremental borrowing rate upon transition.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nOperating lease expense includes short-term lease expense which was not material.\n(2)\nVariable lease expense includes sublease income which was not material.\nRental expense accounted for under the previous accounting standard was $\n119.0\nmillion in 2019.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows (in millions):\nMaturities of lease liabilities as of September 30, 2021, were as follows (in millions):\nAs of September 30, 2021, we have additional operating leases for facilities that have not yet commenced with undiscounted lease obligations of approximately $\n24\nmillion and additional finance leases for equipment that have not yet commenced with undiscounted lease obligations of approximately $\n10\nmillion. These leases will commence in fiscal 2022.\n85\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows (in millions):\n19.\nBusiness Segment Information\nWe determine our operating segments based on the information used by our chief operating decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, to allocate resources and assess performance. Beginning in fiscal year 2021, we organize our business into\nthree\noperating segments: Intelligent Devices, Software & Control, and Lifecycle Services. This change simplifies our structure around essential offerings, leverages our sharpened industry focus, and recognizes the growing importance of software in delivering value to our customers.\nThe composition of our segments is as follows:\n(1)\nFormerly part of the Architecture & Software segment\n(2)\nFormerly part of the Control Products & Solutions segment\nIntelligent Devices\nThe Intelligent Devices operating segment combines a comprehensive portfolio of smart products that create the foundation of an agile, resilient and sustainable production system.

This integrated portfolio is merging information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT), bringing the benefits of the Connected Enterprise to the production system.\nOur production automation portfolio is multi-discipline and scalable with the ability to handle applications in discrete, batch/hybrid and continuous process, drives control, motion and robotics control, machine safety and process safety. Our products include programmable automation controllers, design, visualization and simulation software, human machine interface products, industrial computers, machine safety and process safety products, industrial networks and security products.\n86\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nOur production operations portfolio helps industrial clients to plan, execute, manage and optimize their production leveraging industrial data and software. Our software products include manufacturing execution systems, performance, quality, supply chain management, data management, edge, analytics and machine learning software that enables customers to improve operational productivity and meet regulatory requirements. These solutions enable enterprise visibility, reduction of unplanned downtime, and optimization of processes.\nLifecycle Services\nThe Lifecycle Services operating segment contains a complete portfolio of professionally delivered services and value-added solutions. This comprehensive portfolio combines technology and domain expertise to help maximize customers’ investment and provide total lifecycle support as they innovate, design, operate and sustain their business investments. This includes:\n•\nconsulting services including safety, security and digital transformation strategy and design;\n•\nprofessional services including global automation and information program and project management and delivery capabilities;\n•\nconnected services including operational technology/plant network, cybersecurity, cloud, predictive/prescriptive analytics, remote support and managed services;\n•\nfield services including asset management, on-site support and safety;\n•\nworkforce services including instructor-led and virtual training, learning and enablement;\n•\nSensia Joint Venture which exclusively serves the oil, gas and petrochemical industry through a combination of connected products and digital automation services and solutions; and\n•\nindustrial automation and information solutions and custom-engineered systems that incorporate our own and third-party  hardware and software products.\n87\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe following tables reflect the sales and operating results of our reportable segments including recast information for fiscal 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\nAmong other considerations, we evaluate performance and allocate resources based upon segment operating earnings before purchase accounting depreciation and amortization, corporate and other, non-operating pension and postretirement benefit (cost) credit, gains and losses on investments, the $\n70\nmillion legal settlement in fiscal 2021, valuation adjustments related to the registration of the PTC Shares in fiscal 2019, interest (expense) income - net, and income tax provision. Depending on the product, intersegment sales within a single legal entity are either at cost or cost plus a mark-up, which does not necessarily represent a market price. Sales between legal entities are at an appropriate transfer price. We allocate costs related to shared segment operating activities to the segments consistent with the methodology used by management to assess segment performance.\n88\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe following tables summarize the identifiable assets at September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 and the provision for depreciation and amortization and the amount of capital expenditures for property for the years then ended for each of the reportable segments and Corporate, including recast information for fiscal 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\nIdentifiable assets at Corporate consist principally of cash, net deferred income tax assets, prepaid pension and property. Property shared by the segments and used in operating activities is also reported in Corporate identifiable assets and Corporate capital expenditures. Corporate identifiable assets include shared net property balances of $\n275.8\nmillion, $\n247.3\nmillion and $\n230.3\nmillion at September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for which depreciation expense has been allocated to segment operating earnings based on the expected benefit to be realized by each segment. Corporate capital expenditures in 2021, 2020 and 2019 primarily consist of property that will be shared by our operating segments.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business activities outside the United States. The following tables present sales and property by geographic region (in millions):\nWe attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination. Sales in North America include $\n3,740.2\nmillion, $\n3,425.1\nmillion, and $\n3,640.2\nmillion related to the U.S in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nIn most countries, we sell primarily through independent distributors in conjunction with our direct sales force. We sell large systems and service offerings principally through our direct sales force, though opportunities are sometimes identified through distributors. Sales to our largest distributor in 2021, 2020, and 2019, which are attributable to all\nthree\nsegments, were approximately\n10\npercent of our total sales.\n89\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareowners and the Board of Directors of\nRockwell Automation, Inc.\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and shareowners’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2021, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Plex Systems, Inc., which was acquired on August 31, 2021, and whose financial statements constitute 19% of total assets and 0.1% of revenues of the financial statements amounts as of and for the year ended September 30, 2021. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Plex Systems, Inc.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nGoodwill Valuation - Sensia Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company performed an impairment evaluation of the goodwill for the Sensia reporting unit by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. In order to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit, management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions related to the discount rate and forecasts of future revenues and Earnings Before Interest Taxes Depreciation & Amortization (“EBITDA”) margins. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the reporting unit, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The goodwill balance was $3,625.9 million as of September 30, 2021, of which $315.5 million related to the Sensia reporting unit. The Company tests for goodwill impairment during the second quarter of each year. As of the annual measurement date, the Company determined that the fair value of the Sensia reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and therefore no impairment was recognized.\nWe identified the impairment evaluation of goodwill for the Sensia reporting unit as a critical audit matter because of the inherent subjectivity involved in management’s estimates and assumptions related to the discount rate and forecasts of future revenues and EBITDA margins. The audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future revenues and EBITDA margins required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the selection of the discount rate and forecasts of future revenues and EBITDA margins for the Sensia reporting unit included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the selection of the discount rate and management’s development of forecasts of future revenues and EBITDA margins.\n•\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts by comparing the forecasts to (1) historical results, (2) internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, and (3) forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports for the Company and its peer companies, including the impact of economic factors on Sensia’s Oil & Gas customers.\n•\nWe evaluated the impact of changes in management’s forecasts from the annual measurement date to September 30, 2021.\n•\nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rate by (1) testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate; (2) testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations; and (3) developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.\nAcquisitions — Plex Systems (Valuation of Customer Relationship and Developed Technology Assets) — Refer to Note 4 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nIn August 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Plex Systems, Inc. (“Plex”). The Company accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including identified intangible assets of $531.4 million, of which $276.4 million related to customer relationships and $232.8 million related to developed technology. Management estimated the fair value of the customer relationships asset using an income approach. The fair value determination of the customer relationships asset required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted cash flows attributable to the existing customers, the customer attrition rate, and discount rate. The fair value determination of the developed technology required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted revenue growth rates, the obsolescence factor, royalty rate, and discount rate.\nWe identified the purchase accounting valuations of the customer relationships and developed technology intangible assets as a critical audit matter due to subjective judgment required to evaluate the significant estimates made in determining fair value, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s key assumptions and estimates related to the customer attrition rate, obsolescence factor, royalty rate, and discount rate.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the fair value of the intangible assets for Plex included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of the customer relationships and developed technology intangible assets, including management’s controls over the development of key judgments including forecasts of future cash flows attributable to existing customers and revenue growth rates, customer attrition rate, royalty rate, obsolescence factor, and discount rates.\n•\nWe assessed the reasonableness of management’s forecasts of future cash flows and revenue growth rates by comparing the projections to (1) historical results, (2) industry data, and (3) certain peer companies.\n•\nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology; (2) customer attrition rate by testing the mathematical accuracy of the rate used; and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the attrition rate assumption; (3) royalty rate and obsolescence factor by testing the mathematical accuracy of the rate and comparing it to market observations; and (4) discount rates, which included testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate, testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\nNovember 9, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1967.\n90"

    "text": "Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness, as of September 30, 2021, of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2021.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2021.\nOn August 31, 2021, we acquired Plex (see Note 4 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). Due to the timing of the acquisition and as permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we have excluded internal controls at Plex from our assessment of the internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2021. Total assets and revenues of Plex that were excluded from our assessment constitute 19.0 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively, of our Consolidated Financial Statement amounts as of and for the year ended September 30, 2021. We are in the process of integrating the acquired business into our existing operations and evaluating the internal controls over financial reporting of the acquired business.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as of September 30, 2021, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, as stated in their report that is included on the previous page.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter to which this report relates that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we acquired Plex as described above. We are in the process of integrating controls, policies, and procedures relating to this transaction and will continue to evaluate the impact of any related changes to our internal control over financial reporting."
