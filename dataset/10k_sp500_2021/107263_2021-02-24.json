    "text": "In this report, Williams (which includes The Williams Companies, Inc. and, unless the context otherwise indicates, all of our subsidiaries) is at times referred to in the first person as “we,” “us,” or “our.” We also sometimes refer to Williams as the “Company.”\nGENERAL\nWe are an energy infrastructure company committed to be the leader in providing infrastructure that safely delivers natural gas products to reliably fuel the clean energy economy. We have operations in 15 supply areas that provide natural gas gathering, processing, and transmission services and natural gas liquids fractionation, transportation, and storage services to more than 600 customers. We own an interest in and operate over 30,000 miles of pipelines, 34 processing facilities, 9 fractionation facilities, and approximately 23 million barrels of NGL storage capacity, handling approximately 30 percent of the nation’s natural gas volumes.\nWe were founded in 1908, originally incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada in 1949 and reincorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 1987. Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “WMB.” Our operations are located in the United States. Williams’ headquarters are located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with other major offices in Salt Lake City, Utah; Houston, Texas; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Our telephone number is 918-573-2000.\n4\nService Assets, Customers, and Contracts\nInterstate Natural Gas Pipeline Assets\nOur interstate natural gas pipelines, which are presented in our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico segment as described under the heading “Business Segments,” are subject to regulation by the FERC and as such, our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce are subject to regulation. The rates are established through the FERC’s ratemaking process.\nOur interstate natural gas pipelines transport and store natural gas for a broad mix of customers, including local natural gas distribution companies, public utilities, municipalities, direct industrial users, electric power generators, and natural gas marketers and producers. Our interstate natural gas transmission businesses are fully contracted under long-term firm reservation contracts with high credit quality customers. These contracts have various expiration dates and account for the major portion of our regulated businesses, and are not exposed to crude oil prices. Additionally, we offer storage services and interruptible transportation services under shorter-term agreements. Transco’s and Northwest Pipeline’s three largest customers in 2020 accounted for approximately 28 percent and 51 percent, respectively, of their total operating revenues.\nGathering, Processing, and Treating Assets\nOur gathering, processing, and treating operations are presented within our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico, Northeast G&P, and West reporting segments as described under the heading “Business Segments.”\nOur gathering systems receive natural gas from producers’ crude oil and natural gas wells and gather these volumes to gas processing, treating, or redelivery facilities. Typically, natural gas, in its raw form, is not acceptable for transportation in major interstate natural gas pipelines or for commercial use as a fuel. Our treating facilities\n5\nremove water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other contaminants, and collect condensate. We are generally paid a fee based on the volume of\nnatural gas gathered and/or treated, generally measured in the Btu heating value.\nIn addition, natural gas contains various amounts of NGLs, which generally have a higher value when separated from the natural gas stream. Our processing plants extract the NGLs, which include ethane, primarily used in the petrochemical industry; propane, used for heating, fuel, and also in the petrochemical industry; and, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline, primarily used by the refining industry.\nOur gas processing services generate revenues primarily from the following types of contracts:\n•\nFee-based: We are paid a fee based on the volume of natural gas processed, generally measured in the Btu heating value. A portion of our fee-based processing revenue includes a share of the margins on the NGLs produced. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 80 percent of our NGL production volumes were under fee-based contracts.\n•\nNoncash commodity-based:  We also process gas under two types of commodity-based contracts, keep-whole and percent-of-liquids, where we receive consideration for our services in the form of NGLs. For a keep-whole arrangement we replace the Btu content of the retained NGLs with natural gas purchases, also known as shrink replacement gas. For a percent-of-liquids arrangement, we deliver an agreed-upon percentage of the extracted NGLs and retain the remainder. Retained NGLs are referred to as our equity NGL production. Per-unit NGL margins are calculated based on sales of our own equity volumes at the processing plants. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 20 percent of our NGL production volumes were under noncash commodity-based contracts.\nGenerally, our gathering and processing agreements are long-term agreements, with terms ranging from month-to-month to the life of the producing lease. Certain contracts include  cost of service mechanisms that are designed to support a return on invested capital and allow our gathering rates to be adjusted, subject to specified caps in certain cases, to account for variability in volume, capital expenditures, commodity price fluctuations, compression and other expenses. We also have certain gas gathering and processing agreements with MVC, whereby the customer is obligated to pay a contractually determined fee based on any shortfall between the actual gathered and processed volumes and the MVC for a stated period.\nDemand for gas gathering and processing services is dependent on producers’ drilling activities, which is impacted by the strength of the economy, commodity prices, and the resulting demand for natural gas by manufacturing and industrial companies and consumers. Our gathering, processing, and treating businesses do not have direct exposure to crude oil prices. Our on-shore natural gas gathering and processing businesses are substantially focused on gas-directed drilling basins rather than crude oil, with a broad diversity of basins and customers served. Declines in crude oil drilling would be expected to result in less associated natural gas production, which could drive more demand for natural gas produced from gas-directed basins we serve.\nDuring 2020, our facilities gathered and processed gas and crude oil for approximately 230 customers. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 73 percent of our gathering and processing fee revenues and NGL margins from our noncash commodity-based agreements. We believe counterparty credit concerns in our gathering and processing businesses are significantly mitigated by the physical nature of our services, where we gather at the wellhead and are therefore critical to a producer’s ability to move product to market.\nCrude Oil Transportation and Production Handling Assets\nOur crude oil transportation operations, which are presented in our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico segment as described under the heading “Business Segments,” earn revenues typically by volumetric-based fee arrangements. Revenue sources have historically included a combination of fixed-fee, volumetric-based fee, and cost reimbursement arrangements. Generally, fixed fees associated with the production at our Gulf Coast production handling facilities are recognized on a units-of-production basis. Certain fixed fees associated with the production at our Gulfstar One facility are recognized based on contractually determined maximum daily quantities. Our crude oil transportation business is supported mostly by major oil producers with long-cycle perspectives.\n6\nKey variables for all of our businesses will continue to be:\n•\nObstacles to our expansion efforts, including delays or denials of necessary permits and opposition to hydrocarbon-based energy development;\n•\nProducer drilling activities impacting natural gas supplies supporting our gathering and processing volumes;\n•\nRetaining and attracting customers by continuing to provide reliable services;\n•\nRevenue growth associated with additional infrastructure either completed or currently under construction;\n•\nPrices impacting our commodity-based activities;\n•\nDisciplined growth in our service areas.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nConsistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources, our operations are conducted, managed, and presented in Part I of this Annual Report within the following reportable segments: Transmission & Gulf of Mexico, Northeast G&P, and West.\nOur reportable segments are comprised of the following business activities:\n•\nTransmission & Gulf of Mexico is comprised of our interstate natural gas pipelines, Transco and Northwest Pipeline, as well as natural gas gathering and processing and crude oil production handling and transportation assets in the Gulf Coast region, including a 51 percent interest in Gulfstar One (a consolidated  variable interest entity), which is a proprietary floating production system, a 50 percent equity-method investment in Gulfstream, and a 60 percent equity-method investment in Discovery.\n•\nNortheast G&P is comprised of our midstream gathering, processing, and fractionation businesses in the Marcellus Shale region primarily in Pennsylvania and New York, and the Utica Shale region of eastern Ohio, as well as a 65 percent interest in our Northeast JV (a consolidated variable interest entity) which operates in West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, a 66 percent interest in Cardinal (a consolidated variable interest entity) which operates in Ohio, a 69 percent equity-method investment in Laurel Mountain, a 99 percent interest in Caiman II (a former equity-method investment which is a consolidated entity following our November 2020 acquisition of an additional ownership interest) which owns a 50 percent equity-method investment in Blue Racer, and Appalachia Midstream Investments, a wholly owned subsidiary that owns equity-method investments with an approximate average 66 percent interest in multiple gas gathering systems in the Marcellus Shale region.\n•\nWest is comprised of our gas gathering, processing, and treating operations in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado and Wyoming, the Barnett Shale region of north-central Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas, the Haynesville Shale region of northwest Louisiana, and the Mid-Continent region which includes the Anadarko, Arkoma, and Permian basins.

For a discussion of our ongoing expansion projects, see Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n7\nTransmission & Gulf of Mexico\nThis segment includes the Transco interstate natural gas pipeline that extends from the Gulf of Mexico to the eastern seaboard, the Northwest Pipeline interstate natural gas pipeline, as well as natural gas gathering, processing and treating, crude oil production handling, and NGL fractionation assets within the onshore, offshore shelf, and deepwater areas in and around the Gulf Coast states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. This segment also includes various petrochemical and feedstock pipelines in the Gulf Coast region.\nTransco\nTransco is an interstate natural gas transmission company that owns and operates a 9,800-mile natural gas pipeline system, which is regulated by the FERC, extending from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and the Gulf of Mexico through Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to the New York City metropolitan area. The system serves customers in Texas and 12 southeast and Atlantic seaboard states, including major metropolitan areas in Georgia, North Carolina, Washington, D.C., Maryland, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.\nAt December 31, 2020, Transco’s system had a system-wide delivery capacity totaling approximately 17.9 MMdth/d. During 2020, Transco completed one fully-contracted expansion and began partial early service on two additional fully-contracted expansions, which added more than 0.5 MMdth of firm transportation capacity per day to our pipeline. Transco’s system includes 57 compressor stations, four underground storage fields, and one LNG storage facility. Compression facilities at sea level-rated capacity total approximately 2.3 million horsepower.\nTransco has natural gas storage capacity in four underground storage fields located on or near its pipeline system or market areas and operates two of these storage fields. Transco also has storage capacity in an LNG storage facility that it owns and operates. The total usable gas storage capacity available to Transco and its customers in such underground storage fields and LNG storage facility and through storage service contracts is approximately 194 MMdth of natural gas. At December 31, 2020, Transco’s customers had stored in its facilities approximately 148 MMdth of natural gas. Storage capacity permits our customers to inject gas into storage during the summer and off-peak periods for delivery during peak winter demand periods.\nNorthwest Pipeline\nNorthwest Pipeline is an interstate natural gas transmission company that owns and operates a 3,900-mile natural gas pipeline system, which is regulated by the FERC, extending from the San Juan basin in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado through Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington to a point on the Canadian border near Sumas, Washington. Northwest Pipeline provides services for markets in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, California, and Arizona, either directly or indirectly through interconnections with other pipelines.\nAt December 31, 2020, Northwest Pipeline’s system had long-term firm transportation and storage redelivery agreements with aggregate capacity reservations of approximately 3.8 MMdth/d. Northwest Pipeline’s system includes 42 transmission compressor stations having a combined sea level-rated capacity of approximately 473,000 horsepower.\nNorthwest Pipeline owns a one-third undivided interest in the Jackson Prairie underground storage facility in Washington and contracts with a third party for natural gas storage services in the Clay basin underground field in Utah. Northwest Pipeline also owns and operates an LNG storage facility in Washington. These storage facilities have an aggregate working natural gas storage capacity of 14.2 MMdth, which is substantially utilized for third-party natural gas. These natural gas storage facilities enable Northwest Pipeline to balance daily receipts and deliveries and provide storage services to customers.\n8\nGas Transportation, Processing, and Treating Assets\nThe following tables summarize the significant operated assets of this segment:\n_____________\n(1)\nIncludes 100 percent of the statistics associated with operated equity-method investments.\nCrude Oil Transportation and Production Handling Assets\nIn addition to our natural gas assets, we own and operate four deepwater crude oil pipelines and own production platforms serving the deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico.

We also own and operate 44 Mbbls/d of condensate stabilization capacity, a 135 Mbbls/d NGL fractionation facility, approximately 970,000 barrels of NGL storage capacity, and other ancillary assets, including loading and terminal facilities in Ohio.\nNGLs are extracted from the natural gas stream in our Oak Grove and Fort Beeler cryogenic processing plants.  Ethane produced at our de-ethanizer is transported to markets via our 50-mile ethane pipeline from Oak Grove to Houston, Pennsylvania. The remaining mixed NGL stream from the de-ethanizer is then transported via pipeline and fractionated at either our Moundsville or Harrison County, Ohio, fractionation facility. The resulting products are then transported on truck or rail. Ohio Valley Midstream provides residue natural gas take away options for our customers with interconnections to three interstate transmission pipelines.\nNortheast G&P Operating Statistics\n__________\n(1)    Annual average Mbbls/d.\n(2)    Includes 100 percent of the volumes associated with operated equity-method investments, including the Laurel Mountain Midstream partnership; and the Bradford Supply Hub and a portion of the Marcellus South Supply Hub within Appalachia Midstream Investments. Beginning November 18, 2020, we operate Blue Racer. Blue Racer gathering volumes of 1.38 Bcf/d, plant inlet natural gas volumes of 0.95 Bcf/d, NGL production of 65 Mbbls/d, and NGL equity sales of 6 Mbbls/d have been excluded.\nAcquisition of UEOM and formation of Northeast JV\nAs of December 31, 2018, we owned a 62 percent interest in UEOM which we accounted for as an equity-method investment. On March 18, 2019, we signed and closed the acquisition of the remaining 38 percent interest in UEOM. As a result of acquiring this additional interest, we obtained control of and now consolidate UEOM. (See Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nIn June 2019, we contributed our consolidated interests in UEOM and our Ohio Valley midstream business to a newly formed partnership, and we retained 65 percent ownership of, as well as operate and consolidate, the Northeast JV business.\nCertain Equity-Method Investments\nAppalachia Midstream Investments\nThrough our Appalachia Midstream Investments, we operate 100 percent of and own an approximate average 66 percent interest in the Bradford Supply Hub gathering system and own an approximate average 68 percent interest in the Marcellus South gathering system, together which consist of approximately 1,058 miles of gathering pipeline in the Marcellus Shale region with the capacity to gather 5,031 MMcf/d of natural gas. The majority of our volumes in the region are gathered from northern Pennsylvania, southwestern Pennsylvania, and the northwestern panhandle of West Virginia in core areas of the Marcellus Shale. We operate the assets under long-term, 100 percent fixed-fee gathering agreements that include significant acreage dedications and, in the Bradford Supply Hub, a cost of service mechanism. Additionally, some Marcellus South agreements have MVCs.\n12\nLaurel Mountain\nWe own a 69 percent interest in a joint venture, Laurel Mountain, that includes a 1,145-mile gathering system that we operate in western Pennsylvania with the capacity to gather 0.9 Bcf/d of natural gas.

Belvieu fractionation train, which was placed into service in the first quarter of 2020.\nOther\nOther includes certain previously owned operations, minor business activities that are not reportable segments, as well as corporate operations.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nFERC\nOur gas pipeline interstate transmission and storage activities are subject to FERC regulation under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) and under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and, as such, our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, accounting, and the extension, enlargement, or abandonment of our jurisdictional facilities, among other things, are subject to regulation. Each of our gas pipeline companies holds certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the FERC authorizing ownership and operation of all pipelines, facilities, and properties for which certificates are required under the NGA. FERC Standards of Conduct govern how our interstate pipelines communicate and do business with gas marketing employees. Among other things, the Standards of Conduct require that interstate gas pipelines not operate their systems to preferentially benefit gas marketing functions.\nFERC regulation requires all terms and conditions of service, including the rates charged, to be filed with and approved by the FERC before any changes can go into effect. Our interstate gas pipeline companies establish rates through the FERC’s ratemaking process. In addition, our interstate gas pipelines may enter into negotiated rate agreements where cost-based recourse rates are made available. Key determinants in the FERC ratemaking process include:\n•\nCosts of providing service, including depreciation expense;\n15\n•\nAllowed rate of return, including the equity component of the capital structure and related income taxes;\n•\nContract and volume throughput assumptions.\nThe allowed rate of return is determined in each rate case. Rate design and the allocation of costs between the reservation and commodity rates also impact profitability. As a result of these proceedings, certain revenues previously collected may be subject to refund.\nWe also own interests in and operate natural gas liquids pipelines that are regulated by various federal and state governmental agencies. Services provided on our interstate natural gas liquids pipelines are subject to regulation under the Interstate Commerce Act by the FERC, which has authority over the terms and conditions of service; rates, including depreciation and amortization policies; and initiation of service. Our intrastate natural gas liquids pipelines providing common carrier service are subject to regulation by various state regulatory agencies.\nPipeline Safety\nOur gas pipelines are subject to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Jobs Creation Act of 2011 (Pipeline Safety Act), and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016, which regulate safety requirements in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of interstate natural gas transmission facilities. The United States Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) administers federal pipeline safety laws.\nFederal pipeline safety laws authorize PHMSA to establish minimum safety standards for pipeline facilities and persons engaged in the transportation of gas or hazardous liquids by pipeline. These safety standards apply to the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of gas and hazardous liquids pipeline facilities affecting interstate or foreign commerce. PHMSA has also established reporting requirements for operators of gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities, as well as provisions for establishing the qualification of pipeline personnel and requirements for managing the integrity of gas transmission and distribution lines and certain hazardous liquid pipelines. To ensure compliance with these provisions, PHMSA performs pipeline safety inspections and has the authority to initiate enforcement actions.\nIn 2016, PHMSA published a proposed rulemaking that would impose new or more stringent requirements for certain natural gas pipelines including, expanding certain of PHMSA’s current regulatory safety programs for natural gas lines in high-population areas (also known as moderate consequence areas (MCAs)) that do not qualify as high-consequence areas (HCAs) and requiring maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) validation through re-verification of all historical records for pipelines in service, which may require natural gas pipelines installed before 1970 (previously excluded from certain pressure testing obligations) to be pressure tested. However, PHMSA has since decided to split this proposed rule (Mega Rule), into three separate rulemaking proceedings. The first of these three rulemakings, relating to onshore gas transmission pipelines, was published as a final rule on October 1, 2019, and imposes numerous requirements, including MAOP reconfirmation, the periodic assessment of additional pipeline mileage outside of HCAs, the reporting of exceedances of MAOP, and the consideration of seismicity as a risk factor in integrity management. In accordance with the final rule, we have developed new procedures and updated our existing pipeline safety program to facilitate meeting all requirements within the time frames stated. The remaining rulemakings comprising the Mega Rule are expected to be issued in 2021 and will include revised pipeline repair criteria as well as more stringent corrosion control requirements.\nPHMSA also published new or more stringent rules for onshore hazardous liquids transportation lines in October 2019 requiring integrity assessments on all onshore pipe that accommodate inline inspection tools.\nWe are also expecting additional regulations due to new pipeline safety legislation finalized in December 2020 that reauthorized PHMSA pipeline safety programs.  The new legislation includes mandates for PHMSA to publish final rules for advanced leak detection for gas pipelines, additional repair criteria for gas and hazardous liquids pipelines, updated operating and maintenance standards requirements applicable to large-scale liquefied natural gas facilities, certain Coastal Waters and Coastal Beaches to be designated as USA ecological resources for purposes of\n16\ndetermining whether a hazardous liquid pipeline is in a high consequence area, and the gas gathering portion of the proposed Mega Rule.\nNew regulations adopted by PHMSA may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of our operations, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays.\nPipeline Integrity Regulations\nWe have an enterprise-wide Gas Integrity Management Plan that we believe meets the PHMSA final rule that was issued pursuant to the requirements of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. The rule requires gas pipeline operators to develop an integrity management program for gas transmission pipelines that could affect HCAs in the event of pipeline failure. The integrity management program includes a baseline assessment plan along with periodic reassessments to be completed within required time frames. In meeting the integrity regulations, we have identified HCAs and developed baseline assessment plans. Ongoing periodic reassessments and initial assessments of any new HCAs have been completed. We estimate that the cost to be incurred in 2021 associated with this program to be approximately $105 million. Management considers costs associated with compliance with the rule to be prudent costs incurred in the ordinary course of business and, therefore, recoverable through Northwest Pipeline’s and Transco’s rates.\nWe have an enterprise-wide Liquid Integrity Management Plan that we believe meets the PHMSA final rule that was issued pursuant to the requirements of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002.  The rule requires liquid pipeline operators to develop an integrity management program for liquid transmission pipelines that could affect HCAs in the event of pipeline failure. The integrity management program includes a baseline assessment plan along with periodic reassessments expected to be completed within required time frames. In meeting the integrity regulations, we utilized government defined HCAs and developed baseline assessment plans. We completed assessments within the required time frames. We estimate that the cost to be incurred in 2021 associated with this program will be approximately $3 million. Ongoing periodic reassessments and initial assessments of any new HCAs are expected to be completed within the time frames required by the rule. Management considers the costs associated with compliance with the rule to be prudent costs incurred in the ordinary course of business.\nState Gathering Regulations\nOur onshore midstream gathering operations are subject to laws and regulations in the various states in which we operate. For example, the Texas Railroad Commission has the authority to regulate the terms of service for our intrastate natural gas gathering business in Texas. Although the applicable state regulations vary widely, they generally require that pipeline rates and practices be reasonable and nondiscriminatory, and may include provisions covering marketing, pricing, pollution, environment, and human health and safety. Some states, such as New York, have specific regulations pertaining to the design, construction, and operations of gathering lines within such state.\nIntrastate Liquids Pipelines in the Gulf Coast\nOur intrastate liquids pipelines in the Gulf Coast are regulated by the Louisiana Public Service Commission, the Texas Railroad Commission, and various other state and federal agencies. These pipelines are also subject to the liquid pipeline safety and integrity regulations discussed above since both Louisiana and Texas have adopted the integrity management regulations defined in PHMSA.\nOCSLA\nOur offshore gas and liquids pipelines located on the outer continental shelf are subject to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which provides in part that outer continental shelf pipelines “must provide open and nondiscriminatory access to both owner and non-owner shippers.”\nSee Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 19 – Contingent Liabilities and Commitments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on our regulatory matters. For additional information regarding regulatory matters, please also refer to Part 1, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” —\n“The\n17\noperation of our businesses might be adversely affected by regulatory proceedings, changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers,”\nand\n“The natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines and storage assets, including a reasonable rate of return.\n”\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nOur operations are subject to federal environmental laws and regulations as well as the state, local, and tribal laws and regulations adopted by the jurisdictions in which we operate. We could incur liability to governments or third parties for any unlawful discharge of pollutants into the air, soil, or water, as well as liability for cleanup costs. Materials could be released into the environment in several ways including, but not limited to:\n•\nLeakage from gathering systems, underground gas storage caverns, pipelines, processing or treating facilities, transportation facilities, and storage tanks;\n•\nDamage to facilities resulting from accidents during normal operations;\n•\nDamages to onshore and offshore equipment and facilities resulting from storm events or natural disasters;\n•\nBlowouts, cratering, and explosions.\nIn addition, we may be liable for environmental damage caused by former owners or operators of our properties.\nWe believe compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or current competitive position. However, environmental laws and regulations could affect our business in various ways from time to time, including incurring capital and maintenance expenditures, fines and penalties, and creating the need to seek relief from the FERC for rate increases to recover the costs of certain capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses.\nFor additional information regarding the potential impact of federal, state, tribal, or local regulatory measures on our business and specific environmental issues, please refer to Part 1, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” —\n“Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities, and expenditures that could exceed our expectations,”\nand Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Environmental” and “Environmental Matters” in  Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 19 – Contingent Liabilities and Commitments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCOMPETITION\nGas Pipeline Business\nThe market for supplying natural gas is highly competitive and new pipelines, storage facilities, and other related services are expanding to service the growing demand for natural gas. Additionally, pipeline capacity in many growing natural gas supply basins is constrained causing competition to increase among pipeline companies as they strive to connect those basins to major natural gas demand centers.\nIn our business, we predominately compete with major intrastate and interstate natural gas pipelines. In the last few years, local distribution companies have also started entering into the long-haul transportation business through joint venture pipelines.\nThe principle elements of competition in the interstate natural gas pipeline business are based on rates, reliability, quality of customer service, diversity of supply, and proximity to customers and market hubs.\nSignificant entrance barriers to build new pipelines exist, including federal and growing state regulations and public opposition against new pipeline builds, and these factors will continue to impact potential competition for the\n18\nforeseeable future. However, we believe our past success in working with regulators and the public, the position of our existing infrastructure, established strategic long-term contracts, and the fact that our pipelines have numerous receipt and delivery points along our systems provide us a competitive advantage, especially along the eastern seaboard and northwestern United States.\nMidstream Business\nCompetition for natural gas gathering, processing, treating, transporting, and storing natural gas continues to increase as production from shales and other resource areas continues to grow. Our midstream services compete with similar facilities that are in the same proximity as our assets.\nWe face competition from companies of varying size and financial capabilities, including major and independent natural gas midstream providers, private equity firms, and major integrated oil and natural gas companies that gather, transport, process, fractionate, store, and market natural gas and NGLs, as well as some larger exploration and production companies that are choosing to develop midstream services to handle their own natural gas.\nOur gathering and processing agreements are generally long-term agreements that may include acreage dedication. Competition for natural gas volumes is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms (products retained or fees charged), array of services provided, efficiency and reliability of services, location of gathering facilities, available capacity, downstream interconnects, and latent capacity. We believe our significant presence in traditional prolific supply basins, our solid positions in growing shale plays, our expertise and reputation as a reliable operator, and our ability to offer integrated packages of services position us well against our competition.\nFor additional information regarding competition for our services or otherwise affecting our business, please refer to Part 1, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” - “\nThe financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access and demand for those supplies in the markets we serve,”\n“\nOur industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results\n,” and “\nWe may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow.\n”\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe are committed to maintaining an environment that enables us to attract, develop, and retain a highly skilled and diverse group of talented employees who help promote long-term value creation.\nEmployees\nAs of February 1, 2021, we had 4,739 full-time employees located throughout the United States. Of this total, approximately 21 percent are women and more than 14 percent are ethnically diverse. During 2020, our voluntary turnover rate was 4.6 percent.\nWe encourage you to review our 2019 Sustainability Report available on our website for more information about our human capital programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by references into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWorkforce Safety\nWe continue to advance our safety-first culture by developing and empowering our employees to operate our assets in a safe, reliable, and customer-focused way.\nWe strive to continuously improve safety and achieve better performance than the industry benchmark. When a safety hazard is recognized, every employee is empowered to stop work activities and make it right. Safety and environmental-focused goals and related metrics comprise 10 percent of our annual incentive program for employees, providing an increased focus on activities that help us meet enterprise safety commitments.\n19\nFor 2019, these metrics included our Near Miss to Incident Ratio, emphasizing our safety focus on hazard recognition and reinforcing the importance of incident prevention, and our Late Post Startup Deliverables metric, emphasizing the importance of completing all post startup deliverables associated with newly completed projects.\nAs disclosed in our 2020 Proxy Statement, we exceeded our targets for these safety metrics in 2019, achieving a Near Miss to Incident ratio of 13.98:1, versus a target between 9:1 and 10:1, and less than 1 percent of Late Post Startup Deliverables, versus a target between 3 percent and 4 percent.\nFor 2020, these metrics include our High Potential Near Miss to Incident Ratio, again emphasizing our safety focus on high potential hazard recognition and reinforcing the importance of incident prevention, and our environmental metric Loss of Primary Containment, focused on reducing greenhouse gases and considered a leading indicator to more significant process safety incidents.\nWorkforce Health & Development\nOur employees are our most valued resource and the driving force behind our reputation as a safe, reliable company that does the right thing, every time. Cultivating a healthy work environment increases productivity and promotes long-term value creation.\nWe provide a comprehensive total rewards program that includes base salary, an all-employee annual incentive program, retirement benefits, and health benefits, including a wellness program. We provide employees with company-paid life insurance, disability coverage, and paid parental leave for both birth and non-birth parents. Our annual incentive program is a key component of our commitment to a performance culture focused on recognizing and rewarding high performance.\nIn order to attract and retain top talent, we create an environment where employees feel fulfilled and supported in their personal and professional development. We offer robust corporate and technical training programs to support the professional development of our employees and add long-term value to our business. Additionally, we support strong employee engagement by encouraging open dialogue regarding professional development. Performance is measured considering both the achieved results associated with attaining annual goals and observable skills and behaviors based on our defined competencies that contribute to workplace effectiveness and career success.\nThe Compensation and Management Development Committee of our Board of Directors oversees the establishment and administration of our compensation programs, including incentive compensation and equity-based plans.\nIn response to the ongoing impact of COVID-19, we took action to safeguard the health and safety of our employees, including allowing our employees to work remotely where possible, while implementing safety guidance and best practices designed to protect the health of those entering our facilities.\nDiversity & Inclusion\nWe encourage a diverse and inclusive workforce, helping our employees reach their full potential and promoting innovation. By embracing differences—whether race, gender, nationality, ability, orientation, or generation—we bring the best out of our people to drive business growth and long-term success.\nTo support networking and professional development opportunities, we endorse employee resource groups, which allow more inclusivity by offering an opportunity for employees to network, gain development, and provide input to leaders on specific needs. We strive for diverse representation at all levels through our talent management practices and employee development programs as we are committed to helping all employees develop. Diversity metrics are reported monthly to our management team.\nWe also have a Diversity and Inclusion Council, chaired by our chief executive officer and including members of the executive officer team, organizational and operational leaders, and individual employees, to promote policies, practices, and procedures that support the growth of a high-performing workforce where all individuals can achieve their full potential. The council serves as the governing body over enterprise diversity and inclusion initiatives.\nOur Board of Directors includes 12 independent members, one-third of which are women. As part of the director selection and nominating process, the Governance and Sustainability Committee annually assesses the\n20\nBoard’s diversity in such areas as geography, race, gender, ethnicity, and age. We strive to maintain a board of directors with diverse occupational and personal backgrounds.\nWEBSITE ACCESS TO REPORTS AND OTHER INFORMATION\nWe file our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and other documents electronically with the SEC under the Exchange Act.\nOur Internet website is www.williams.com\n.\nWe make available, free of charge, through the Investors tab of our Internet website our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8‑K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.

Many of the factors that will determine these results are beyond our ability to control or predict. Specific factors that could cause actual results to differ from results contemplated by the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:\n•\nAvailability of supplies, market demand, and volatility of prices;\n•\nDevelopment and rate of adoption of alternative energy sources;\n•\nThe impact of existing and future laws and regulations, the regulatory environment, environmental liabilities, and litigation, as well as our ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals, and achieve favorable rate proceeding outcomes;\n•\nOur exposure to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties;\n22\n•\nOur ability to acquire new businesses and assets and successfully integrate those operations and assets into existing businesses as well as successfully expand our facilities, and to consummate asset sales on acceptable terms;\n•\nWhether we are able to successfully identify, evaluate, and timely execute our capital projects and investment opportunities;\n•\nThe strength and financial resources of our competitors and the effects of competition;\n•\nThe amount of cash distributions from and capital requirements of our investments and joint ventures in which we participate;\n•\nWhether we will be able to effectively execute our financing plan;\n•\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social, and governance practices;\n•\nThe physical and financial risks associated with climate change;\n•\nThe impacts of operational and developmental hazards and unforeseen interruptions;\n•\nThe risks resulting from outbreaks or other public health crises, including COVID-19;\n•\nRisks associated with weather and natural phenomena, including climate conditions and physical damage to our facilities;\n•\nActs of terrorism, cybersecurity incidents, and related disruptions;\n•\nOur costs and funding obligations for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans;\n•\nChanges in maintenance and construction costs, as well as our ability to obtain sufficient construction- related inputs, including skilled labor;\n•\nInflation, interest rates, and general economic conditions (including future disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets and the impact of these events on customers and suppliers);\n•\nRisks related to financing, including restrictions stemming from debt agreements, future changes in credit ratings as determined by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, and the availability and cost of capital;\n•\nThe ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other oil exporting nations to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls and the impact on domestic production;\n•\nChanges in the current geopolitical situation;\n•\nChanges in U.S. governmental administration and policies;\n•\nWhether we are able to pay current and expected levels of dividends;\n•\nAdditional risks described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nGiven the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. We disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments.\nIn addition to causing our actual results to differ, the factors listed above and referred to below may cause our intentions to change from those statements of intention set forth in this report. Such changes in our intentions may also cause our results to differ. We may change our intentions, at any time and without notice, based upon changes in such factors, our assumptions, or otherwise.\nBecause forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, we caution that there are important factors, in addition to those listed above, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These factors are described in the following section.\n23\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report. Each of these factors could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and, in some cases our reputation. The occurrence of any of such risks could also adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access and demand for those supplies in the markets we serve.\nOur ability to maintain and expand our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses depends on the level of drilling and production by third parties in our supply basins. Production from existing wells and natural gas supply basins with access to our pipeline and gathering systems will naturally decline over time. The amount of natural gas reserves underlying these existing wells may also be less than anticipated, and the rate at which production from these reserves declines may be greater than anticipated. We do not obtain independent evaluations of natural gas reserves connected to our systems and processing facilities. Accordingly, we do not have independent estimates of total reserves dedicated to our systems or the anticipated life of such reserves. In addition, low prices for natural gas, regulatory limitations, including environmental regulations, or the lack of available capital have, and may continue to, adversely affect the development and production of existing or additional natural gas reserves and the installation of gathering, storage, and pipeline transportation facilities. The import and export of natural gas supplies may also be affected by such conditions. Low natural gas prices in one or more of our existing supply basins, whether caused by a lack of infrastructure or otherwise, could also result in depressed natural gas production in such basins and limit the supply of natural gas made available to us. The competition for natural gas supplies to serve other markets could also reduce the amount of natural gas supply for our customers. A failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies will adversely impact our ability to maximize the capacities of our gathering, transportation, and processing facilities.\nDemand for our services is dependent on the demand for gas in the markets we serve. Alternative fuel sources such as electricity, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy, as well as technological advances and renewable sources of energy, could reduce demand for natural gas in our markets and have an adverse effect on our business.\nA failure to obtain access to sufficient natural gas supplies or a reduction in demand for our services in the markets we serve could result in impairments of our assets and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nPrices for natural gas, NGLs, oil, and other commodities, are volatile and this volatility has and could continue to adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, access to capital, and ability to maintain or grow our businesses.\nOur revenues, operating results, future rate of growth, and the value of certain components of our businesses depend primarily upon the prices of natural gas, NGLs, oil, or other commodities, and the differences between prices of these commodities and could be materially adversely affected by an extended period of low commodity prices, or a decline in commodity prices. Price volatility has and could continue to impact both the amount we receive for our products and services and the volume of products and services we sell. Prices affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. Price volatility has and could continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nThe markets for natural gas, NGLs, oil, and other commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. Wide fluctuations in prices might result from one or more factors beyond our control, including:\n•\nImbalances in supply and demand whether rising from worldwide or domestic supplies of and demand for natural gas, NGLs, oil, and related commodities;\n•\nTurmoil in the Middle East and other producing regions;\n24\n•\nThe activities of OPEC and other countries, whether acting independently of or informally aligned with OPEC, which have significant oil, natural gas or other commodity production capabilities, including Russia;\n•\nThe level of consumer demand;\n•\nThe price and availability of other types of fuels or feedstocks;\n•\nThe availability of pipeline capacity;\n•\nSupply disruptions, including plant outages and transportation disruptions;\n•\nThe price and quantity of foreign imports and domestic exports of natural gas and oil;\n•\nDomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n•\nThe credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties, and our credit risk management will not be able to completely eliminate such risk.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers and counterparties in the ordinary course of our business. Generally, our customers are rated investment grade, are otherwise considered creditworthy, are required to make prepayments or provide security to satisfy credit concerns, or are dependent upon us, in some cases without a readily available alternative, to provide necessary services. However, our credit procedures and policies cannot completely eliminate customer and counterparty credit risk. Our customers and counterparties include industrial customers, local distribution companies, natural gas producers, and marketers whose creditworthiness may be suddenly and disparately impacted by, among other factors, commodity price volatility, deteriorating energy market conditions, and public and regulatory opposition to energy producing activities. In a low commodity price environment certain of our customers have been or could be negatively impacted, causing them significant economic stress resulting, in some cases, in a customer bankruptcy filing or an effort to renegotiate our contracts. To the extent one or more of our key customers commences bankruptcy proceedings, our contracts with such customers may be subject to rejection under applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or, if we so agree, may be renegotiated. Further, during any such bankruptcy proceeding, prior to assumption, rejection or renegotiation of such contracts, the bankruptcy court may temporarily authorize the payment of value for our services less than contractually required, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers and counterparties or otherwise do not take sufficient mitigating actions, including obtaining sufficient collateral, deterioration in their creditworthiness, and any resulting increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them could cause us to write down or write off accounts receivable. Such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur, and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe face opposition to operation and expansion of our pipelines and facilities from various individuals and groups.\nWe have experienced, and we anticipate that we will continue to face, opposition to the operation and expansion of our pipelines and facilities from governmental officials, environmental groups, landowners, tribal groups, local groups and other advocates. In some instances, we encounter opposition that disfavors hydrocarbon-based energy supplies regardless of practical implementation or financial considerations. Opposition to our operation and expansion can take many forms, including the delay or denial of required governmental permits, organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the operation or expansion of our assets and business. In addition, acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism could cause significant damage or injury to people, property, or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our operations. Any such event that delays or prevents the expansion of our business, that interrupts the revenues generated by our operations, or which causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n25\nWe may not be able to grow or effectively manage our growth.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we consider acquisition opportunities and engage in significant capital projects. We have both a project lifecycle process and an investment evaluation process. These are processes we use to identify, evaluate, and execute on acquisition opportunities and capital projects. We may not always have sufficient and accurate information to identify and value potential opportunities and risks or our investment evaluation process may be incomplete or flawed. Regarding potential acquisitions, suitable acquisition candidates or assets may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable or, where multiple parties are trying to acquire an acquisition candidate or assets, we may not be chosen as the acquirer. If we are able to acquire a targeted business, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated benefits in a timely manner.\nOur growth may also be dependent upon the construction of new natural gas gathering, transportation, compression, processing or treating pipelines, and facilities, NGL transportation, or fractionation or storage facilities as well as the expansion of existing facilities. Additional risks associated with construction may include the inability to obtain rights-of-way, skilled labor, equipment, materials, permits, and other required inputs in a timely manner such that projects are completed, on time or at all, and the risk that construction cost overruns could cause total project costs to exceed budgeted costs. Additional risks associated with growing our business include, among others, that:\n•\nChanging circumstances and deviations in variables could negatively impact our investment analysis, including our projections of revenues, earnings, and cash flow relating to potential investment targets, resulting in outcomes that are materially different than anticipated;\n•\nWe could be required to contribute additional capital to support acquired businesses or assets, and we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates and for which contractual protections are either unavailable or prove inadequate;\n•\nAcquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert financial and operational resources from existing operations and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls, and procedures;\n•\nAcquisitions and capital projects may require substantial new capital, including the issuance of debt or equity, and we may not be able to access credit or capital markets or obtain acceptable terms.\nIf realized, any of these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, including the possible impairment of our assets, or cash flows.\nOur industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe have numerous competitors in all aspects of our businesses, and additional competitors may enter our markets. Any current or future competitor that delivers natural gas, NGLs, or other commodities into the areas that we operate could offer transportation services that are more desirable to shippers than those we provide because of price, location, facilities or other factors.  In addition, current or potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or have greater financial resources than we do, which could affect our ability to make strategic investments or acquisitions. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the construction, expansion, or refurbishment of their facilities than we can. Failure to successfully compete against current and future competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe do not own 100 percent of the equity interests of certain subsidiaries, including the Partially Owned Entities, which may limit our ability to operate and control these subsidiaries. Certain operations, including the Partially Owned Entities, are conducted through arrangements that may limit our ability to operate and control these operations.\nThe operations of our current non-wholly-owned subsidiaries, including the Partially Owned Entities, are conducted in accordance with their organizational documents. We anticipate that we will enter into more such arrangements, including through new joint venture structures or new Partially Owned Entities. We may have limited\n26\noperational flexibility in such current and future arrangements and we may not be able to control the timing or amount of cash distributions received. In certain cases:\n•\nWe cannot control the amount of cash reserves determined to be necessary to operate the business, which reduces cash available for distributions;\n•\nWe cannot control the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund and we are dependent on third parties to fund their required share of capital expenditures;\n•\nWe may be subject to restrictions or limitations on our ability to sell or transfer our interests in the jointly owned assets;\n•\nWe may be forced to offer rights of participation to other joint venture participants in the area of mutual interest;\n•\nWe have limited ability to influence or control certain day to day activities affecting the operations;\n•\nWe may have additional obligations, such as required capital contributions, that are important to the success of the operations.\nIn addition, conflicts of interest may arise between us, on the one hand, and other interest owners, on the other hand. If such conflicts of interest arise, we may not have the ability to control the outcome with respect to the matter in question. Disputes between us and other interest owners may also result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.\nThe risks described above or the failure to continue such arrangements could adversely affect our ability to conduct the operations that are the subject of such arrangements which could, in turn, negatively affect our business, growth strategy, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow.\nWe rely on a limited number of customers and producers for a significant portion of our revenues and supply of natural gas and NGLs. Although many of our customers and suppliers are subject to long-term contracts, if we are unable to replace or extend such contracts, add additional customers, or otherwise increase the contracted volumes of natural gas provided to us by current producers, in each case on favorable terms, if at all, our financial condition, growth plans, and the amount of cash available to pay dividends could be adversely affected. Our ability to replace, extend, or add additional customer or supplier contracts, or increase contracted volumes of natural gas from current producers, on favorable terms, or at all, is subject to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n•\nThe level of existing and new competition in our businesses or from alternative sources, such as electricity, renewable resources, coal, fuel oils, or nuclear energy;\n•\nNatural gas and NGL prices, demand, availability, and margins in our markets. Higher prices for energy commodities related to our businesses could result in a decline in the demand for those commodities and, therefore, in customer contracts or throughput on our pipeline systems. Also, lower energy commodity prices could negatively impact our ability to maintain or achieve favorable contractual terms, including pricing, and could also result in a decline in the production of energy commodities resulting in reduced customer contracts, supply contracts, and throughput on our pipeline systems;\n•\nGeneral economic, financial markets, and industry conditions;\n•\nThe effects of regulation on us, our customers, and our contracting practices;\n•\nOur ability to understand our customers’ expectations, efficiently and reliably deliver high quality services and effectively manage customer relationships. The results of these efforts will impact our reputation and positioning in the market.\n27\nCertain of our gas pipeline services are subject to long-term, fixed-price contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if our cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts.\nOur gas pipelines provide some services pursuant to long-term, fixed-price contracts. It is possible that costs to perform services under such contracts will exceed the revenues our pipelines collect for their services. Although other services are priced at cost-based rates that are subject to adjustment in rate cases, under FERC policy, a regulated service provider and a customer may mutually agree to sign a contract for service at a “negotiated rate” that may be above or below the FERC regulated cost-based rate for that service. These “negotiated rate” contracts are not generally subject to adjustment for increased costs that could be produced by inflation or other factors relating to the specific facilities being used to perform the services.\nSome of our businesses are exposed to supplier concentration risks arising from dependence on a single or a limited number of suppliers.\nSome of our businesses may be dependent on a small number of suppliers for delivery of critical goods or services. If a supplier on which one of our businesses depends were to fail to timely supply required goods and services, such business may not be able to replace such goods and services in a timely manner or otherwise on favorable terms or at all. If our business is unable to adequately diversify or otherwise mitigate such supplier concentration risks and such risks were realized, such businesses could be subject to reduced revenues and increased expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.\nFailure of our service providers or disruptions to our outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.\nCertain of our accounting and information technology services are currently provided by third-party vendors, and sometimes from service centers outside of the United States. Services provided pursuant to these arrangements  could be disrupted. Similarly, the expiration of agreements associated with such arrangements or the transition of services between providers could lead to loss of institutional knowledge or service disruptions. Our reliance on others as service providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAn impairment of our assets, including property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity-method investments, could reduce our earnings.\nGAAP requires us to test certain assets for impairment on either an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur which indicate that the carrying value of such assets might be impaired. The outcome of such testing could result in impairments of our assets including our property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity-method investments. Additionally, any asset monetizations could result in impairments if any assets are sold or otherwise exchanged for amounts less than their carrying value. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. Regardless of the industry, investors’ increased focus and activism related to ESG and similar matters may hinder access to capital, as investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company’s ESG practices. Companies that do not adapt to or comply with investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or that are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face pressures from our stockholders, who are increasingly focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability. Our stockholders may require us to implement ESG procedures or standards in order to continue engaging with us, to remain invested in us or before they may make further investments in us. Additionally, we may face reputational challenges in the event our\n28\nESG procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by certain constituencies.  We have adopted certain practices as highlighted in our 2019 Sustainability Report, including with respect to air emissions, biodiversity and land use, climate change and environmental stewardship. It is possible, however, that our stockholders might not be satisfied with our sustainability efforts or the speed of their adoption. If we do not meet our stockholders’ expectations, our business, ability to access capital, and/or our stock price could be harmed.\nAdditionally, adverse effects upon the oil and gas industry related to the worldwide social and political environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from climate change, changes in political leadership and environmental policies, changes in geopolitical-social views toward fossil fuels and renewable energy, concern about the environmental impact of climate change, and investors’ expectations regarding ESG matters, may also adversely affect demand for our services. Any long-term material adverse effect on the oil and gas industry could have a significant financial and operational adverse impact on our business.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the price of our stock and our business and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change.\nThe threat of global climate change may create physical and financial risks to our business. Energy needs vary with weather conditions. To the extent weather conditions may be affected by climate change, energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in more pipelines and other infrastructure to serve increased demand. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stresses, including service interruptions. Weather conditions outside of our operating territory could also have an impact on our revenues. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service. We may not be able to pass on the higher costs to our customers or recover all costs related to mitigating these physical risks.\nAdditionally, many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels and increased frequency and severity of weather events, which may lead to higher insurance costs, or a decrease in available coverage, for our assets in areas subject to severe weather. These climate-related changes could damage our physical assets, especially operations located in low-lying areas near coasts and river banks, and facilities situated in hurricane-prone and rain-susceptible regions.\nTo the extent financial markets view climate change and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. Climate change and GHG regulation could also reduce demand for our services. Our business could also be affected by the potential for lawsuits against GHG emitters, based on links drawn between GHG emissions and climate change.\nOur operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions.\nThere are operational risks associated with the gathering, transporting, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, the fractionation, transportation, and storage of NGLs, and crude oil transportation and production handling, including:\n•\nAging infrastructure and mechanical problems;\n•\nDamages to pipelines and pipeline blockages or other pipeline interruptions;\n•\nUncontrolled releases of natural gas (including sour gas), NGLs, crude oil, or other products;\n•\nCollapse or failure of storage caverns;\n•\nOperator error;\n•\nDamage caused by third-party activity, such as operation of construction equipment;\n•\nPollution and other environmental risks;\n•\nFires, explosions, craterings, and blowouts;\n29\n•\nSecurity risks, including cybersecurity;\n•\nOperating in a marine environment.\nAny of these risks could result in loss of human life, personal injuries, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, loss of services to our customers, reputational damage, and substantial losses to us. The location of certain segments of our facilities in or near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. An event such as those described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance.\nWe face risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other health epidemics\nThe global outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) is currently impacting countries, communities, supply chains, and markets. We provide a critical service to our customers, which means that it is paramount that we keep our employees safe. We cannot predict whether, and the extent to which, COVID-19 will have a material impact on our business, including our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. COVID-19 poses a risk to our employees, our customers, our suppliers, and the communities in which we operate, which could negatively impact our business. To the extent that our access to the capital markets is adversely affected by COVID-19, we may need to consider alternative sources of funding for our operations and for working capital, any of which could increase our cost of capital. Measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns, may cause us to experience operational delays or to delay plans for growth. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact, among others. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other factors described in this report.\nOur assets and operations, as well as our customers’ assets and operations, can be adversely affected by weather and other natural phenomena.\nOur assets and operations, especially those located offshore, and our customers’ assets and operations can be adversely affected by hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, landslides, tornadoes, fires, and other natural phenomena and weather conditions, including extreme or unseasonable temperatures, making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with our assets and operations. A significant disruption in our or our customers’ operations or the occurrence of a significant liability for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by acts of terrorism and related disruptions.\nGiven the volatile nature of the commodities we transport, process, store, and sell, our assets and the assets of our customers and others in our industry may be targets of terrorist activities. A terrorist attack could create significant price volatility, disrupt our business, limit our access to capital markets, or cause significant harm to our operations, such as full or partial disruption to our ability to produce, process, transport, or distribute natural gas, NGLs, or other commodities. Acts of terrorism, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with acts of terrorism, could cause environmental repercussions that could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA breach of our information technology infrastructure, including a breach caused by a cybersecurity attack on us or third parties with whom we are interconnected, may interfere with the safe operation of our assets, result in the disclosure of personal or proprietary information, and harm our reputation.\nWe rely on our information technology infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information, including information we use to safely operate our assets. Our Board of Directors has oversight\nresponsibility with regard to assessment of the major risks inherent in our business, including cybersecurity risks, and reviews management’s efforts to address and mitigate such risks, including the establishment and implementation of policies to address cybersecurity threats. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant time, manpower and capital in our information technology infrastructure. However, the age, operating systems, or condition of our current information technology infrastructure and software assets and our ability to maintain and upgrade such assets\n30\ncould affect our ability to resist cybersecurity threats. While we believe that we maintain appropriate information security policies, practices, and protocols, we regularly face cybersecurity and other security threats to our information technology infrastructure, which could include threats to our operational industrial control systems and safety systems that operate our pipelines, plants, and assets. We face unlawful attempts to gain access to our information technology infrastructure, including coordinated attacks from hackers, whether state-sponsored groups, “hacktivists”, or private individuals. We face the threat of theft and misuse of sensitive data and information, including customer and employee information. We also face attempts to gain access to information related to our assets through attempts to obtain unauthorized access by targeting acts of deception against individuals with legitimate access to physical locations or information. We also are subject to cybersecurity risks arising from the fact that our business operations are interconnected with third parties, including third-party pipelines, other facilities and our contractors and vendors. In addition, the breach of certain business systems could affect our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. Breaches in our information technology infrastructure or physical facilities, or other disruptions including those arising from theft, vandalism, fraud, or unethical conduct, could result in damage to or destruction of our assets, unnecessary waste, safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational damage, potential liability, the loss of contracts, the imposition of significant costs associated with remediation and litigation, heightened regulatory scrutiny, increased insurance costs, and have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to our pipelines and facilities become unavailable to transport natural gas and NGLs or to treat natural gas, our revenues could be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon third-party pipelines and other facilities that provide delivery options to and from our pipelines and facilities for the benefit of our customers. Because we do not own these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control. If these pipelines or facilities were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines or facilities, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity, increased credit requirements or rates charged by such pipelines or facilities or other causes, we and our customers would have reduced capacity to transport, store or deliver natural gas or NGL products to end use markets or to receive deliveries of mixed NGLs, thereby reducing our revenues. Any temporary or permanent interruption at any key pipeline interconnection or in operations on third-party pipelines or facilities that would cause a material reduction in volumes transported on our pipelines or our gathering systems or processed, fractionated, treated, or stored at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur operating results for certain components of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal basis.\nRevenues from certain components of our business can have seasonal characteristics. In many parts of the country, demand for natural gas and other fuels peaks during the winter. As a result, our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Demand for natural gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our natural gas transportation arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns.\nWe do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe do not own all of the land on which our pipelines and facilities have been constructed. As such, we are subject to the possibility of increased costs to retain necessary land use. In those instances in which we do not own the land on which our facilities are located, we obtain the rights to construct and operate our facilities and gathering systems on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. In addition, some of our facilities cross Native American lands pursuant to rights-of-way of limited terms. We may not have the right of eminent domain over land owned by Native American tribes. Our loss of any of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of stockholder activism.\nIn recent years, stockholder activism, including threatened or actual proxy contests, has been directed against numerous public companies, including ours. We were the target of a proxy contest from a stockholder activist, which resulted in our incurring significant costs. If stockholder activists were to again take or threaten to take\n31\nactions against the Company or seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction or operations of the Company, we could incur significant costs as well as the distraction of management, which could have an adverse effect on our business or financial results. In addition, actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nOur costs and funding obligations for our defined benefit pension plans and costs for our other postretirement benefit plans are affected by factors beyond our control.\nWe have defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The timing and amount of our funding requirements under the defined benefit pension plans depend upon a number of factors that we control, including changes to pension plan benefits, as well as factors outside of our control, such as asset returns, interest rates, and changes in pension laws. Changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase our funding requirements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Financing Our Business\nA downgrade of our credit ratings, which are determined outside of our control by independent third parties, could impact our liquidity, access to capital, and our costs of doing business.\nDowngrades of our credit ratings increase our cost of borrowing and could require us to provide collateral to our counterparties, negatively impacting our available liquidity. In addition, our ability to access capital markets could be limited by the downgrading of our credit ratings.\nCredit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings. The analysis includes a number of criteria such as, business composition, market and operational risks, as well as various financial tests. Credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for industry sectors and various debt ratings and may make changes to those criteria from time to time. Credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the ratings agencies. As of the date of the filing of this report, we have been assigned an investment-grade credit rating by the credit ratings agencies.\nDifficult conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur businesses may be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions or future disruptions in the global financial markets. Included among these potential negative impacts are industrial or economic contraction (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) leading to reduced energy demand and lower prices for our products and services and increased difficulty in collecting amounts owed to us by our customers. If financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to implement our business plans or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. In addition, financial markets have periodically been affected by concerns over U.S. fiscal and monetary policies. These concerns, as well as actions taken by the U.S. federal government in response to these concerns, could significantly and adversely impact the global and U.S. economies and financial markets, which could negatively impact us in the manner described above.\nRestrictions in our debt agreements and the amount of our indebtedness may affect our future financial and operating flexibility.\nOur total outstanding long-term debt (including current portion) as of December 31, 2020, was $22.3 billion.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our and our material subsidiaries’ ability to incur certain liens to support indebtedness and our ability to merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets in certain circumstances. In addition, certain of our debt agreements contain various covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to make certain distributions during the continuation of an event of default, the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, and our, and our material subsidiaries’, ability to enter into certain affiliate transactions and certain restrictive agreements. Certain of our debt agreements also contain, and those we enter into in the future may contain, financial covenants, and other limitations with which we will need to comply.\n32\nOur debt service obligations and the covenants described above could have important consequences. For example, they could:\n•\nMake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, which could in turn result in an event of default on such indebtedness;\n•\nImpair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes, or other purposes;\n•\nDiminish our ability to withstand a continued or future downturn in our business or the economy generally;\n•\nRequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the payments of dividends, general corporate purposes, or other purposes;\n•\nLimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, including limiting our ability to expand or pursue our business activities and preventing us from engaging in certain transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us.\nOur ability to comply with our debt covenants, to repay, extend, or refinance our existing debt obligations and to obtain future credit will depend primarily on our operating performance. Our ability to refinance existing debt obligations or obtain future credit will also depend upon the current conditions in the credit markets and the availability of credit generally. If we are unable to comply with these covenants, meet our debt service obligations, or obtain future credit on favorable terms, or at all, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell assets. We may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in events of default, which could render such indebtedness due and payable. We may not have sufficient liquidity to repay our indebtedness in such circumstances. In addition, cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions in our debt agreements could cause a default or acceleration to have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. For more information regarding our debt agreements, please read Note 14 – Debt and Banking Arrangements\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nChanges to interest rates or increases in interest rates could adversely impact our access to credit, share price, our ability to issue securities or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes, and our ability to make cash dividends at our intended levels.\nInterest rates may increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on future credit facilities and debt offerings could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. As with other yield-oriented securities, our share price will be impacted by the level of our dividends and implied dividend yield. The dividend yield is often used by investors to compare and rank yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Therefore, changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our shares, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our share price and our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and to pay cash dividends at our intended levels.\nOur hedging activities might not be effective and could increase the volatility of our results.\nIn an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations, we have entered, and may in the future enter into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations. In these hedging activities, we have used, and may in the future use, fixed-price, forward, physical purchase, and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. Nevertheless, no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract. For example, a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the contract’s counterparty credit or performance risk. Therefore, unhedged risks will always continue to exist. While we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy, we may not be able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such, future cash flows and results of operations could be impacted by counterparty default.\n33\nOur and our customers’ access to capital could be affected by financial institutions’ policies concerning fossil- fuel related businesses\n.\nPublic concern regarding the potential effects of climate change have directed increased attention towards the funding sources of fossil-fuel energy companies. As a result, certain financial institutions, funds, and other sources of capital have restricted or eliminated their investment in certain market segments of fossil-fuel related energy.  Ultimately, limiting fossil-fuel related companies’ access to capital could make it more difficult for our customers to secure funding for exploration and production activities or for us to secure funding for growth projects.  Such a lack of capital could also both indirectly affect demand for our services and directly affect our ability to fund construction or other capital projects.\nRisks Related to Regulations\nThe operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by regulatory proceedings, changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers.\nPublic and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in the proposal and/or implementation of increased regulations. Such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, including litigation of energy industry matters. Both the shippers on our pipelines and regulators have rights to challenge the rates we charge under certain circumstances. Any successful challenge could materially affect our results of operations.\nCertain inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings are ongoing. Adverse effects may continue as a result of the uncertainty of ongoing inquiries, investigations, and court proceedings, or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs. In addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us, civil or criminal fines and/or penalties, or other regulatory action, including legislation, which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our results of operations or increase our operating costs in other ways. Current legal proceedings or other matters, including environmental matters, suits, regulatory appeals, and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us which, among other outcomes, could result in the imposition of substantial penalties and fines and could damage our reputation. The result of such adverse decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance.\nIn addition, existing regulations, including those pertaining to financial assurances to be provided by our businesses in respect of potential asset decommissioning and abandonment activities, might be revised, reinterpreted, or otherwise enforced in a manner that differs from prior regulatory action. New laws and regulations, including those pertaining to oil and gas hedging and cash collateral requirements, might also be adopted or become applicable to us, our customers, or our business activities. The change in the U.S. governmental administration and its policies may increase the likelihood of such legal and regulatory developments. If new laws or regulations are imposed relating to oil and gas extraction, or if additional or revised levels of reporting, regulation, or permitting moratoria are required or imposed, including those related to hydraulic fracturing, the volumes of natural gas and other products that we transport, gather, process, and treat could decline, our compliance costs could increase, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines and storage assets, including a reasonable rate of return.\nIn addition to regulation by other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities, interstate pipeline transportation and storage service is subject to regulation by the FERC. Federal regulation extends to such matters as:\n•\nTransportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce;\n•\nRates, operating terms, types of services, and conditions of service;\n•\nCertification and construction of new interstate pipelines and storage facilities;\n34\n•\nAcquisition, extension, disposition, or abandonment of existing interstate pipelines and storage facilities;\n•\nAccounts and records;\n•\nDepreciation and amortization policies;\n•\nRelationships with affiliated companies that are involved in marketing functions of the natural gas business;\n•\nMarket manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases, or transportation of natural gas.\nRegulatory or administrative actions in these areas, including successful complaints or protests against the rates of the gas pipelines, can affect our business in many ways, including decreasing tariff rates and revenues, decreasing volumes in our pipelines, increasing our costs, and otherwise altering the profitability of our pipeline business.\nOur operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities, and expenditures that could exceed our expectations.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal, and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, endangered and threatened species, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the security of chemical and industrial facilities. Substantial costs, liabilities, delays, and other significant issues related to environmental laws and regulations are inherent in the gathering, transportation, storage, processing, and treating of natural gas, fractionation, transportation, and storage of NGLs, and crude oil transportation and production handling as well as waste disposal practices and construction activities. New or amended environmental laws and regulations can also result in significant increases in capital costs we incur to comply with such laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, the imposition of stricter conditions on or revocation of permits, the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations, and delays or denials in granting permits.\nJoint and several strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations, for the remediation of contaminated areas and in connection with spills or releases of materials associated with natural gas, oil, and wastes on, under or from our properties and facilities. Private parties, including the owners of properties through which our pipeline and gathering systems pass and facilities where our wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage arising from our operations. Some sites at which we operate are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and processing or oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours.\nWe are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets, whether acquired or developed, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown. In connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses, which may not be covered by insurance. In addition, the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive, and we might be required to shut down, divest or alter the operation of those facilities, which might cause us to incur losses.\nIn addition, climate change regulations and the costs that may be associated with such regulations and with the regulation of emissions of GHGs have the potential to affect our business. Regulatory actions by the Environmental Protection Agency or the passage of new climate change laws or regulations could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, or administer and manage any GHG emissions program.  We believe it is possible that future governmental legislation and/or regulation may require us either to limit GHG emissions associated with our operations or to purchase allowances for such emissions. We could also be subjected to a carbon tax assessed on the basis of carbon dioxide emissions or otherwise. However, we cannot predict precisely what form these future regulations might take, the stringency of any such regulations or when they might become effective. Several legislative bills have been introduced in the United States Congress that would require carbon dioxide emission reductions. Previously considered proposals have included, among other things, limitations on the amount of GHGs that can be emitted (so called “caps”)\n35\ntogether with systems of permitted emissions allowances. These proposals could require us to reduce emissions or to purchase allowances for such emissions.\nIn addition to activities on the federal level, state and regional initiatives could also lead to the regulation of GHG emissions sooner than and/or independent of federal regulation. These regulations could be more stringent than any federal legislation that may be adopted. Future legislation and/or regulation designed to reduce GHG emissions could make some of our activities uneconomic to maintain or operate.  We continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments in this area and otherwise take efforts to limit and reduce GHG emissions from our facilities. Although the regulation of GHG emissions may have a material impact on our operations and rates, we believe it is premature to attempt to quantify the potential costs of the impacts.\nIf we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe do not insure against all potential risks and losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities or by the inability of our insurers to satisfy our claims.\nIn accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, risks and losses, and only at levels we believe to be appropriate. The occurrence of any risks not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and our ability to repay our debt.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively impact our results of operations.\nEvents such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, mismatch of skill sets to future needs, the challenges of attracting new, qualified workers to the midstream energy industry, or unavailability of contract labor may lead to operating challenges such as lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, including with the workforce needs associated with projects and ongoing operations. Failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate the businesses. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nHolders of our common stock may not receive dividends in the amount expected or any dividends.\nWe may not have sufficient cash each quarter to pay dividends or maintain current or expected levels of dividends. The actual amount of cash we dividend may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n•\nThe amount of cash that our subsidiaries distribute to us;\n•\nThe amount of cash we generate from our operations, our working capital needs, our level of capital expenditures, and our ability to borrow;\n•\nThe restrictions contained in our indentures and credit facility and our debt service requirements;\n•\nThe cost of acquisitions, if any.\nA failure either to pay dividends or to pay dividends at expected levels could result in a loss of investor confidence, reputational damage, and a decrease in the value of our stock price."

Our threshold for disclosing material environmental legal proceedings involving a governmental authority where potential monetary sanctions are involved is $1 million.\nOn January 19, 2016, we received a Notice of Noncompliance with certain Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) regulations under the Clean Air Act at our Moundsville Fractionator Facility from the EPA, Region 3. Subsequently, the EPA alleged similar violations of certain LDAR regulations at our Oak Grove Gas Plant. On March 19, 2018, we received a Notice of Violation of certain LDAR regulations at our former Ignacio Gas Plant from the EPA, Region 8, following an on-site inspection of the facility. On March 20, 2018, we also received a Notice of Violation of certain LDAR regulations at our Parachute Creek Gas Plant from the EPA, Region 8. All such notices were subsequently referred to a common attorney at the Department of Justice (DOJ). We are exploring global resolution of the claims at these facilities, as well as alleged violations at certain other facilities, with the DOJ.

    "text": "General\nWe are an energy infrastructure company focused on connecting North America’s significant hydrocarbon resource plays to growing markets for natural gas and NGLs through our gas pipeline and midstream business. Our operations are located in the United States.\nOur interstate natural gas pipeline strategy is to create value by maximizing the utilization of our pipeline capacity by providing high quality, low cost transportation of natural gas to large and growing markets. Our gas pipeline businesses’ interstate transmission and storage activities are subject to regulation by the FERC and as such, our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, and the extension, expansion or abandonment of jurisdictional facilities and accounting, among other things, are subject to regulation. Rates are established in accordance with the FERC’s ratemaking process. Changes in commodity prices and volumes transported have limited near-term impact on these revenues because the majority of cost of service is recovered through firm capacity reservation charges in transportation rates.\nThe ongoing strategy of our midstream operations is to safely and reliably operate large-scale midstream infrastructure where our assets can be fully utilized and drive low per-unit costs. We focus on consistently attracting new business by providing highly reliable service to our customers. These services include natural gas gathering, processing, treating, and compression, NGL fractionation and transportation, crude oil production handling and transportation, marketing services for NGL, crude oil and natural gas, as well as storage facilities.\nConsistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources, our operations are conducted, managed, and presented within the following reportable segments: Transmission & Gulf of Mexico, Northeast G&P, and West. All remaining business activities as well as corporate activities are included in Other. Our reportable segments are comprised of the following businesses:\n•\nTransmission & Gulf of Mexico is comprised of our interstate natural gas pipelines, Transco and Northwest Pipeline, as well as natural gas gathering and processing and crude oil production handling and transportation assets in the Gulf Coast region, including a 51 percent interest in Gulfstar One (a consolidated variable interest entity), which is a proprietary floating production system, a 50 percent equity-method investment in Gulfstream, and a 60 percent equity-method investment in Discovery.\n•\nNortheast G&P is comprised of our midstream gathering, processing, and fractionation businesses in the Marcellus Shale region primarily in Pennsylvania and New York, and the Utica Shale region of eastern Ohio, as well as a 65 percent interest in our Northeast JV (a consolidated variable interest entity) which operates in West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, a 66 percent interest in Cardinal (a consolidated variable interest entity) which operates in Ohio, a 69 percent equity-method investment in Laurel Mountain, a 99 percent interest in Caiman II (a former equity-method investment which is a consolidated entity following our November 2020 acquisition of an additional ownership interest) which owns a 50 percent equity-method investment in Blue Racer, and Appalachia Midstream Investments, a wholly owned subsidiary that owns equity-method investments with an approximate average 66 percent interest in multiple gas gathering systems in the Marcellus Shale region.\n•\nWest is comprised of our gas gathering, processing, and treating operations in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado and Wyoming, the Barnett Shale region of north-central Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas, the Haynesville Shale region of northwest Louisiana, and the Mid-Continent region which includes the Anadarko, Arkoma, and Permian basins. This segment also includes our NGL and natural gas marketing business, storage facilities, an undivided 50 percent interest in an NGL fractionator near Conway, Kansas, a 50 percent equity-method investment in OPPL, a 50 percent equity-method investment in RMM, a 20 percent equity-method investment in Targa Train 7, and a 15 percent interest in Brazos Permian II, LLC (Brazos Permian II).\n•\nOther includes certain previously owned operations, minor business activities that are not reportable segments, as well as corporate operations.\n41\nUnless indicated otherwise, the following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and liquidity relates to our current continuing operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nDividends\nIn December 2020, we paid a regular quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. On January 26, 2021, our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share payable on March 29, 2021.\nOverview\nNet income (loss) attributable to The Williams Companies, Inc.\n, for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased $639 million\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting:\n•\nAn $860 million increase in\nImpairment of equity-method investments\n;\n•\nA $187 million\nImpairment of goodwill\nin 2020;\n•\nA $123 million unfavorable change in\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\nprimarily driven by a reduced share of certain impairment charges attributable to noncontrolling interests;\n•\nThe absence of a $122 million gain recognized on the sale of our interest in an equity-method investment in 2019;\n•\nA $76 million unfavorable change in\nOther income (expense) – net.\nThese unfavorable changes were partially offset by:\n•\nA $282 million decrease in\nImpairment of certain assets\n;\n•\nA $234 million favorable change in\nOperating and maintenance expenses\nand\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\n, driven by lower employee-related expenses, including the absence of 2019 severance and related costs and the associated reduced costs in 2020 as well as the benefit of a change in an employee benefit policy;\n•\nA $256 million favorable change in\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes.\nAcquisition of Caiman II (Blue Racer)\nAs of December 31, 2019, we effectively owned a 29 percent indirect interest in Blue Racer through our 58 percent interest in Caiman II, whose primary asset is a 50 percent interest in Blue Racer. On November 18, 2020, we paid $157 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire an additional 41 percent ownership interest in Caiman II. We now control and consolidate Caiman II, reporting the 50 percent interest in Blue Racer as an equity-method investment.\nExpansion Project Updates\nSignificant expansion project updates for the period, including projects placed into service are described below. Ongoing major expansion projects are discussed later in Company Outlook.\nTransmission & Gulf of Mexico\nHillabee\nIn February 2016, the FERC issued a certificate order for the initial phases of Transco’s Hillabee Expansion Project. The project involves an expansion of Transco’s existing natural gas transmission system from Station 85 in west central Alabama to an interconnection with the Sabal Trail pipeline in east central Alabama. The project is being constructed in phases, and all of the project expansion capacity is dedicated to Sabal Trail pursuant to a capacity lease agreement. Phase I was completed in 2017 and it increased capacity by\n42\n818 Mdth/d. We placed Phase II into service on May 1, 2020. Together, the first two phases of the project increased capacity by 1,025 Mdth/d.\nSoutheastern Trail\nIn October 2019, we received approval from the FERC to expand Transco’s existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from the Pleasant Valley interconnect with Dominion’s Cove Point Pipeline in Virginia to the Station 65 pooling point in Louisiana. We placed 230 Mdth/d of capacity under the project into service in the fourth quarter of 2020, and the project was fully in service on January 1, 2021. In total, the project increased capacity by 296 Mdth/d.\nWest\nProject Bluestem\nWe expanded our presence in the Mid-Continent region through building a 189-mile NGL pipeline from our fractionator and NGL storage facilities near Conway, Kansas, to an interconnection with a third-party NGL pipeline system in Oklahoma, providing us with firm access to Mt. Belvieu pricing. As part of the project, the third party constructed a 110-mile pipeline extension of its existing NGL pipeline system that will have an initial capacity of 120 Mbbls/d. The pipeline and extension projects were placed into service on December 1, 2020. Further, during the first quarter of 2019, we exercised an option to purchase a 20 percent equity interest in Targa Train 7, a Mt. Belvieu fractionation train developed by the third party, which was placed into service in the first quarter of 2020.\nCOVID-19\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has severely impacted global economic activity and caused significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. We are monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and have taken steps intended to protect the safety of our customers, employees, and communities, and to support the continued delivery of safe and reliable service to our customers and the communities we serve. We are continuing to monitor developments with respect to the outbreak and note the following:\n•\nOur financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity have not been materially impacted by direct effects of COVID-19.\n•\nWe believe we have the ability to access the debt market, if necessary, as evidenced by the successful completion of debt offerings during second-quarter 2020, and continue to have significant levels of unused capacity on our revolving credit facility.\n•\nWe continue to monitor and adapt our remote working arrangements and limit business-related travel. Implementation of these measures has not required material expenditures or significantly impacted our ability to operate our business.\n•\nOur remote working arrangements have not significantly impacted our internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures.\nCustomer Bankruptcy\nIn June 2020, our customer, Chesapeake Energy Corporation (Chesapeake), announced that it had voluntarily filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. We provide midstream services, including wellhead gathering, for the natural gas that Chesapeake and its joint interest owners produce, primarily in the Eagle Ford Shale, Haynesville Shale, and Marcellus Shale regions (through Appalachia Midstream Investments).\nIn November 2020, we reached a global resolution with Chesapeake as part of Chesapeake’s restructuring process.  The resolution was approved by the bankruptcy court in December 2020 and per the terms, Chesapeake paid all outstanding pre-petition amounts due to us. Additional terms include reduced gathering fees in the Haynesville Shale region, continuation of the gathering agreements in the Eagle Ford Shale and Marcellus Shale\n43\nregions, a long-term gas supply commitment for Transco’s Regional Energy Access pipeline currently under development, and transferring certain natural gas properties in Louisiana to us.\nCompany Outlook\nOur strategy is to provide large-scale energy infrastructure designed to maximize the opportunities created by the vast supply of natural gas and natural gas products that exists in the United States. We accomplish this by connecting the growing demand for cleaner fuels and feedstocks with our major positions in the premier natural gas and natural gas products supply basins. We continue to maintain a strong commitment to safety, environmental stewardship, operational excellence, and customer satisfaction. We believe that accomplishing these goals will position us to deliver safe and reliable service to our customers and an attractive return to our shareholders. Our business plan for 2021 includes a continued focus on earnings and cash flow growth, while continuing to improve leverage metrics and control operating costs.\nThe credit profiles of certain of our producer customers continue to be challenged, including some that have filed for bankruptcy protection. However, we note that the physical nature of services we provide supports the success of these customers. In many cases, we have long-term acreage dedications with strong historical contractual conveyances that create real estate interests in unproduced gas. Our gathering lines in many cases are physically connected to the customers’ wellheads and pads, and there may not be alternative gathering lines nearby. The construction of gathering systems is capital intensive and it would be costly for others to replicate, especially considering the depletion to date of the associated reserves. As a result, we play a critical role in getting customers’ production from the wellhead to a marketable condition and location. This tends to reduce collectability risk as our services enable producers to generate operating cash flows.\nIn 2021, our operating results are expected to benefit from growth in our Northeast G&P gathering and processing volumes. We also anticipate increases from Transco expansion projects and higher Gulf of Mexico results primarily due to lower anticipated hurricane impacts. These increases will be partially offset by a decrease in West results, including a reduction in NGL transportation volumes on OPPL and certain fee reductions in the Haynesville area in exchange for upstream value in natural gas properties. We also expect a modest increase in expenses, including higher operating taxes.\nOur growth capital and investment expenditures in 2021 are expected to be in a range from $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion. Growth capital spending in 2021 primarily includes Transco expansions, all of which are fully contracted with firm transportation agreements, and projects supporting the Northeast G&P business and opportunities in the Haynesville area. In addition to growth capital and investment expenditures, we also remain committed to projects that maintain our assets for safe and reliable operations, as well as projects that meet legal, regulatory, and/or contractual commitments.\nPotential risks and obstacles that could impact the execution of our plan include:\n•\nContinued negative impacts of COVID-19 driving a global recession, which could result in further downturns in financial markets and commodity prices, as well as impact demand for natural gas and related products;\n•\nOpposition to, and legal regulations affecting, our infrastructure projects, including the risk of delay or denial in permits and approvals needed for our projects;\n•\nCounterparty credit and performance risk, including unexpected developments in customer bankruptcy proceedings;\n•\nUnexpected significant increases in capital expenditures or delays in capital project execution;\n•\nUnexpected changes in customer drilling and production activities, which could negatively impact gathering and processing volumes;\n•\nLower than anticipated demand for natural gas and natural gas products which could result in lower than expected volumes, energy commodity prices, and margins;\n44\n•\nGeneral economic, financial markets, or further industry downturns, including increased interest rates;\n•\nPhysical damages to facilities, including damage to offshore facilities by weather-related events;\n•\nOther risks set forth under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report.\nWe seek to maintain a strong financial position and liquidity, as well as manage a diversified portfolio of energy infrastructure assets that continue to serve key growth markets and supply basins in the United States.\nExpansion Projects\nOur ongoing major expansion projects include the following:\nTransmission & Gulf of Mexico\nNortheast Supply Enhancement\nIn May 2019, we received approval from the FERC to expand Transco’s existing natural gas transmission system to provide incremental firm transportation capacity from Station 195 in Pennsylvania to the Rockaway Delivery Lateral transfer point in New York. However, approvals required for the project from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection were denied in May 2020. We have not refiled our applications for those approvals. Considering that the customer precedent agreements and FERC certificate for the project remain in effect, we had previously concluded that the probability of completing the project was sufficient to not require impairment. However, recent developments in the political and regulatory environments have caused us to slightly lower that assessed probability such that the capitalized project costs now require impairment.  See further discussion in Critical Accounting Estimates.\nLeidy South\nIn July 2020, we received approval from the FERC for the project to expand Transco’s existing natural gas transmission system and also extend its system through a capacity lease with National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation that will enable us to provide incremental firm transportation from Clermont, Pennsylvania and from the Zick interconnection on Transco’s Leidy Line to the River Road regulating station in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. We placed 125 Mdth/d of capacity under the project into service in the fourth quarter of 2020, and we plan to place the remainder of the project into service as early as the fourth quarter of 2021, assuming timely receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. The project is expected to increase capacity by 582 Mdth/d.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions.  We believe that the nature of these estimates and assumptions is material due to the subjectivity and judgment necessary, or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of these on our financial condition or results of operations.\nPension and Postretirement Obligations\nWe have employee benefit plans that include pension and other postretirement benefits. Net periodic benefit cost and obligations for these plans are impacted by various estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, cash balance interest crediting rate, and employee demographics, including retirement age and mortality. These assumptions are reviewed annually and adjustments are made as needed. The assumptions utilized to compute cost and the benefit obligations are shown in Note 10 – Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n45\nThe following table presents the estimated increase (decrease) in net periodic benefit cost and obligations resulting from a one-percentage-point change in the specific assumption.\nOur expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, as determined at the beginning of each fiscal year, are based on the average rate of return expected on the funds invested in the plans. We determine our long-term expected rates of return on plan assets using our expectations of capital market results, which include an analysis of historical results as well as forward-looking projections. These capital market expectations are based on a period of at least 10 years and take into account our investment strategy and mix of assets. We develop our expectations using input from our third-party independent investment consultant. The forward-looking capital market projections start with current conditions of interest rates, equity pricing, economic growth, and inflation and those are overlaid with forward looking projections of normal inflation, growth, and interest rates to determine expected returns. The capital market return projections for specific asset classes in the investment portfolio are then applied to the relative weightings of the asset classes in the investment portfolio. The resulting rates are an estimate of future results and, thus, likely to be different than actual results.\nOur expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used for our pension plans was 4.67 percent in 2020. The 2020 actual return on plan assets for our pension plans was approximately 17.9 percent. The 10-year average rate of return on pension plan assets through December 2020 was approximately 8.6 percent. The expected rates of return on plan assets are long-term in nature and are not significantly impacted by short-term market performance. Changes to our asset allocation also impact the expected rates of return.\nThe discount rates are used to measure the benefit obligations of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The objective of the discount rates is to determine the amount, if invested at the December 31 measurement date in a portfolio of high-quality debt securities, that will provide the necessary cash flows when benefit payments are due. Increases in the discount rates decrease the obligation and, generally, decrease the related cost. The discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined separately based on an approach specific to our plans and their respective expected benefit cash flows as described in Note 1 – General, Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 10 – Employee Benefit Plans of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our discount rate assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions that affect interest rates on long-term, high-quality debt securities as well as by the duration of our plans’ liabilities.\nThe cash balance interest crediting rate assumption represents the average long-term rate by which the pension plans’ cash balance accounts are expected to grow. Interest on the cash balance accounts is based on the 30-year U.S. Treasury securities rate and is credited to the accounts quarterly. An increase in this rate causes the pension obligation and cost to increase.\nEquity-Method Investments\nWe monitor our equity-method investments for any indications that the carrying value may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value.\n46\nIn the first quarter of 2020, we observed a significant decline in the publicly traded price of our common stock (NYSE: WMB) as well as other industry peers and increases in equity yields within the midstream and overall energy industry, which served to increase our estimates of discount rates and weighted-average cost of capital. These changes were attributed to the swift, world-wide economic declines associated with actions to address the spread of COVID-19, coupled with the energy industry impact of significantly reduced energy commodity prices, which were further impacted by crude oil price declines associated with geopolitical actions during the quarter. These significant macroeconomic changes served as indications that the carrying amount of certain of our equity-method investments may have experienced an other-than temporary decline in fair value, determined in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 323, “Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures.”\nAs a result, we estimated the fair value of these equity-method investments in accordance with ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” as of the March 31, 2020, measurement date\n.\nIn assessing the fair value, we were required to consider recent publicly available indications of value, which included lower observed publicly traded EBITDA market multiples as compared with recent history, and significantly higher industry weighted-average discount rates. As a result, we determined that there were other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of certain of our equity-method investments, resulting in recognized impairments during the first quarter of 2020 totaling $938 million. (See Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) This included impairments of certain of our equity-method investments in our Northeast G&P segment totaling $405 million, primarily associated with operations in wet-gas areas where producer drilling activities are influenced by NGL prices, which historically trend with crude oil prices. This total was primarily comprised of impairments of our investment in Caiman II and predominantly wet-gas gathering systems that are part of Appalachia Midstream Investments. We also recognized an impairment of $97 million related to Discovery within the Transmission & Gulf of Mexico segment. We estimated the fair value of these investments as of the March 31, 2020, measurement date utilizing income and market approaches, which were impacted by assumptions reflecting the significant recent market declines previously discussed, such as higher discount rates, ranging from 9.7 percent to 13.5 percent, and lower EBITDA multiples ranging from 5.0x to 6.2x. We also considered any debt held at the investee level, and its impact to fair value. At that time we estimated that a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rates used would increase these recognized impairments by approximately $197 million or decrease the level of these recognized impairments by approximately $121 million and a 0.5x increase or decrease in the EBITDA multiples assumed would decrease or increase the level of impairments recognized by approximately $48 million.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020 we also recognized $436 million of impairments within our West segment related to our investments in RMM and Brazos Permian II, measured using an income approach. Both investees operate in primarily crude oil-driven basins where our gathering volumes are driven by crude oil drilling. Our expectation of continued lower crude oil prices and related expectation of significant reductions in current and future producer activities in these areas led to reduced estimates of expected future cash flows. Our fair value estimates also reflected increases in the discount rates to approximately 17 percent for these investments. We also considered any debt held at the investee level, and its impact to fair value. At that time we estimated that a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would increase these recognized impairments by approximately $32 million, while a one percentage point decrease would decrease these impairments by approximately $43 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, RMM renegotiated service contracts with a significant customer in connection with the customer’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The renegotiated contracts result in lower service rates, and lower projected future cash flows. As a result, we recognized an additional $108 million impairment of our investment in RMM, measured using an income approach. Our estimate of fair value reflects a discount rate of 18 percent. We estimate that a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would increase the recognized impairment by approximately $24 million, while a one percentage point decrease would decrease these impairments by approximately $26 million.\nJudgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimates of future cash flows, discount rates, and market measures utilized. The use of alternate judgments and assumptions could result in a different calculation of fair value, which could ultimately result in the recognition of a different impairment charge in the consolidated financial statements, potentially including impairments for investments that were evaluated but for which no impairments were recognized.\n47\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets\nAs a result of the previously described significant macroeconomic changes during the first quarter of 2020, we also evaluated certain of our property, plant, and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets for indicators of impairment as of March 31, 2020. In our assessments, we considered the impact of the then current market conditions on certain of our assets and did not identify any indicators that the carrying amounts of those assets may not be recoverable. The use of alternate judgments or changes in future conditions could result in a different conclusion regarding the occurrence and measurement of impairments affecting the consolidated financial statements.\nWe also evaluated $212 million of capitalized project development costs for the Northeast Supply Enhancement project for impairment as of December 31, 2020. As previously discussed, approvals required for the project from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection have been denied and we have not refiled at this time. Beginning in May 2020, we discontinued capitalization of costs related to this project.\nConsidering that the customer precedent agreements and FERC certificate for the project remain in effect, we had previously concluded that the probability of completing the project was sufficient to not require impairment. However,\nrecent developments in the political and regulatory environments have caused us to slightly lower that assessed probability such that the capitalized project costs now require impairment. The estimated fair value of the materials within capitalized project costs was determined to be $42 million and considered other internal uses and estimated salvage values. The remaining capitalized costs were determined to have no fair value. As a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $170 million within our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico segment during the fourth quarter of 2020. Our assumption regarding the probability of completing the project is subjective and required management to exercise significant judgment. The use of an alternate judgment could have resulted in a different conclusion regarding the need to evaluate the project for impairment.\n48\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Overview\nThe following table and discussion is a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2020. The results of operations by segment are discussed in further detail following this consolidated overview discussion.\n_______\n*    + = Favorable change; - = Unfavorable change; NM = A percentage calculation is not meaningful due to a change in signs, a zero-value denominator, or a percentage change greater than 200.\n49\n2020 vs. 2019\nService revenues\ndecreased primarily due to lower volumes in our West segment, lower deferred revenue amortization at Gulfstar One, the expiration of an MVC agreement in the Barnett Shale region, and temporary shut-ins at certain offshore Gulf of Mexico operations. This decrease was partially offset by higher Northeast G&P revenues driven by higher volumes and the March 2019 consolidation of UEOM (see Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), higher MVC revenue in our West segment, as well as higher transportation fee revenues at Transco and Northwest Pipeline associated with expansion projects placed in service in 2019 and 2020, increased volumes in the Eastern Gulf region, and higher deficiency fee revenue associated with lower volumes at OPPL.\nService revenues – commodity consideration\ndecreased due to lower commodity prices, as well as lower equity NGL processing volumes due to less producer drilling activity. These revenues represent consideration we receive in the form of commodities as full or partial payment for processing services provided. Most of these NGL volumes are sold within the month processed and therefore are offset within\nProduct costs\nbelow.\nProduct sales\ndecreased primarily due to lower NGL and natural gas prices associated with our marketing and equity NGL sales activities, as well as lower volumes associated with our equity NGL sales activities, partially offset by higher marketing volumes. This decrease also includes lower system management gas sales. Marketing sales and system management gas sales are substantially offset within\nProduct costs\n.\nProduct costs\ndecreased primarily due to lower NGL and natural gas prices associated with our marketing and equity NGL production activities. This decrease also includes lower volumes acquired as commodity consideration for NGL processing services and lower system management gas purchases, partially offset by higher volumes for marketing activities.\nProcessing commodity expenses\ndecreased primarily due to lower natural gas purchases associated with equity NGL production primarily due to lower natural gas prices and lower volumes\n.\nOperating and maintenance expenses\ndecreased primarily due to lower employee-related expenses, including the absence of 2019 severance and related costs and the associated reduced costs in 2020, as well as the favorable impact of a change in an employee benefit policy (see Note 6 – Other Income and Expenses of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and lower maintenance and operating costs primarily due to timing and scope of activities. These decreases are partially offset by higher expenses related to the consolidation of UEOM.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\nincreased primarily due to new assets placed in service and the March 2019 consolidation of UEOM, partially offset by lower expense related to assets that became fully depreciated in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\ndecreased primarily due to lower employee-related expenses, including the absence of 2019 severance and related costs and the associated reduced costs in 2020, as well as the favorable impact of a change in an employee benefit policy (see Note 6 – Other Income and Expenses of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and the absence of transaction costs associated with our 2019 acquisition of UEOM and the formation of the Northeast JV.\nImpairment of certain assets\nincludes the 2019 impairments of our Constitution development project, certain Eagle Ford Shale gathering assets, and certain idle gathering assets. The asset impairments in 2020 included our Northeast Supply Enhancement development project and certain gathering assets in the Marcellus Shale region (see Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nImpairment of goodwill\nreflects the goodwill impairment charge at the Northeast reporting unit in 2020 (see Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\n50\nEquity earnings (losses)\nchanged unfavorably primarily due to our share of 2020 impairments at equity-method investments (see Note 7 – Investing Activities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and lower volumes at OPPL and Discovery. These decreases were partially offset by favorable amortization of basis differences related to impairments of several of our equity-method investments which were recognized in first quarter 2020, as well as higher volumes at Appalachia Midstream Investments, increased results at Blue Racer/Caiman II driven by higher volumes and a higher ownership interest, and the absence of 2019 losses at Brazos Permian II.\nImpairment of equity-method investments\nincludes impairments of various equity-method investments in 2020 and 2019 (see Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nThe unfavorable change in\nOther investing income (loss) – net\nis primarily due to the absence of a 2019 gain on the sale of our equity-method investment in Jackalope, partially offset by the absence of a 2019 loss on the deconsolidation of Constitution (see Note 7 – Investing Activities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nThe unfavorable change in\nOther income (expense) – net\nbelow\nOperating income (loss)\nincludes a charge in the fourth quarter 2020 for a legal settlement associated with former olefins operations, lower equity allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC), and 2020 write-offs of certain regulatory assets related to cancelled projects.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\nchanged favorably primarily due to lower pre-tax income. See Note 8 – Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the effective tax rate compared to the federal statutory rate for both periods.\nThe unfavorable change in\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\nis primarily due to the absence of the 2019 impairment of our Constitution development project and the impact from the formation of the Northeast JV in June 2019, partially offset by the first-quarter 2020 goodwill impairment charge at the Northeast reporting unit, and lower Gulfstar One results.\n2019 vs. 2018\nService revenues\nincreased primarily due to higher transportation fee revenues at Transco associated with expansion projects placed in service in 2018 and 2019, as well as the impact of the consolidation of UEOM, higher Northeast volumes at the Susquehanna Supply Hub and Ohio Valley Midstream regions, and higher gathering rates and volumes at the Utica Shale region. These increases are partially offset by the absence of revenues associated with asset divestitures and deconsolidations during 2018, including our former Four Corners area operations (see Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), as well as lower revenue in the Barnett Shale associated with the end of a contractual MVC period and lower revenue at Gulfstar One primarily associated with producer operational issues.\nService revenues – commodity consideration\ndecreased due to lower NGL prices and lower volumes primarily due to the absence of our former Four Corners area operations. These revenues represent consideration we receive in the form of commodities as full or partial payment for processing services provided. Most of these NGL volumes are sold within the month processed and therefore are offset in\nProduct costs\nbelow.\nProduct sales\ndecreased primarily due to lower NGL and natural gas prices associated with our marketing and equity NGL sales activities, lower volumes from our equity NGL sales primarily reflecting the absence of our former Four Corners area operations, and lower system management gas sales, partially offset by higher marketing volumes. Marketing sales and system management gas sales are substantially offset in\nProduct costs\n.\nProduct costs\ndecreased primarily due to lower NGL and natural gas prices associated with our marketing and equity NGL production activities. This decrease also includes lower volumes acquired as commodity consideration for NGL processing services reflecting the absence of our former Four Corners area operations and lower system management gas purchases, partially offset by higher volumes for marketing activities.\n51\nProcessing commodity expenses\ndecreased primarily due to lower production of equity NGLs primarily related to ethane rejection and the absence of our former Four Corners area operations, and lower prices for natural gas purchases associated with our NGL production\n.\nOperating and maintenance expenses\ndecreased primarily due to the absence of our former Four Corners area operations and lower contracted services at Transco primarily due to the timing of required engine overhauls and integrity testing. These decreases are partially offset by the impact of the consolidation of UEOM and by a $32 million charge for severance and related costs primarily associated with a voluntary separation program (VSP) in 2019.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\ndecreased primarily due to the 2018 impairment of certain assets in the Barnett Shale region, which serves to reduce depreciation prospectively, and the absence of assets disposed including our former Four Corners area operations, partially offset by new assets placed in service and by the impact of the consolidation of UEOM.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\ndecreased primarily due to the absences of a charitable contribution of preferred stock to the Williams Foundation, Inc. (see Note 16 – Stockholders' Equity of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and fees associated with the WPZ Merger, partially offset by a $25 million charge for severance and related costs primarily associated with our 2019 VSP, and transaction expenses associated with the acquisition of UEOM and the formation of the Northeast JV.\nImpairment of certain assets\nincludes 2019 impairments of our Constitution development project, certain Eagle Ford Shale gathering assets, and certain idle gathering assets. Asset impairments in 2018 included certain assets in the Barnett Shale region and certain idle pipelines (see Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nGain on sale of certain assets and businesses\nincludes gains recognized on the sales of our Four Corners area and our Gulf Coast pipeline systems in 2018 (see Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nThe favorable change in\nOther (income) expense – net\nwithin\nOperating income (loss)\nincludes net favorable changes to charges and credits to regulatory assets and liabilities, partially offset by the absence of a 2018 gain on asset retirement.\nThe unfavorable change in\nEquity earnings (losses)\nis primarily due to 2019 losses from our Brazos Permian II investment acquired in December 2018 of $14 million, the impact of the consolidation of UEOM during the first quarter of 2019 which reduced equity earnings by $9 million, and a $7 million unfavorable impact related to the April 2019 sale of our Jackalope investment. Additionally, equity earnings at Aux Sable decreased $9 million related to lower rates reflecting lower NGL prices. These decreases are partially offset by improved results at our Appalachia Midstream Investments of $20 million.\nThe unfavorable change in\nImpairment of equity-method investments\nincludes 2019 noncash impairments, partially offset by the absence of a 2018 impairment of UEOM (see Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nThe unfavorable change in\nOther investing income (loss) – net\nincludes the absence of 2018 gains on the deconsolidations of our Delaware basin assets and Jackalope, and a 2019 loss on the deconsolidation of Constitution. These were partially offset by a 2019 gain on the disposition of Jackalope (see Note 7 – Investing Activities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nInterest expense\nincreased primarily due to an increase in financing obligations associated with Transco’s Atlantic Sunrise project and lower\nInterest capitalized\nrelated to construction projects that have been placed into service.\nThe unfavorable change in\nOther income (expense) – net\nbelow\nOperating income (loss)\nis primarily due to a decrease in equity AFUDC associated with reduced capital expenditures on projects (see Note 6 – Other Income and\n52\nExpenses of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), partially offset by the absence of 2018 unfavorable settlement charges from our pension early payout program.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\nchanged unfavorably primarily due to higher pre-tax income attributable to The Williams Companies, Inc, partially offset by the absence of a charge to establish $105 million valuation allowance, recorded in 2018, on certain deferred tax assets that may not be realized following the WPZ merger. See Note 8 – Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the effective tax rate compared to the federal statutory rate for both periods.\nThe favorable change in\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\nis primarily due to our third- quarter 2018 acquisition of the publicly held interests in WPZ associated with the WPZ Merger, the impairment of Constitution project costs, and lower results at Gulfstar One.\nYear-Over-Year Operating Results – Segments\nWe evaluate segment operating performance based upon\nModified EBITDA\n. Note 20 – Segment Disclosures of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to\nNet income (loss)\n. Management uses\nModified EBITDA\nbecause it is an accepted financial indicator used by investors to compare company performance.  In addition, management believes that this measure provides investors an enhanced perspective of the operating performance of our assets.\nModified EBITDA\nshould not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nTransmission & Gulf of Mexico\n2020 vs. 2019\nTransmission & Gulf of Mexico Modified EBITDA\nincreased primarily due to lower\nImpairment of certain assets\nand favorable changes to\nOther segment costs and expenses,\npartially offset by decreased\nService revenues\n.\nService revenues\ndecreased primarily due to:\n•\nA $115 million decrease due to lower deferred revenue amortization associated with the end of the exclusive use period at Gulfstar One for the Tubular Bells field;\n•\nA $42 million decrease due to temporary shut-ins primarily at Perdido and Gulfstar One related to Gulf of Mexico weather-related events, pricing, and scheduled maintenance;\n53\n•\nA $32 million decrease due to lower volumes at Gulfstar One in the Gunflint field due to ongoing operational issues; partially offset by\n•\nA $65 million increase in Transco’s and Northwest Pipeline’s natural gas transportation revenues associated with expansion projects placed in service in 2019 and 2020;\n•\nA $44 million increase at Gulfstar One associated with higher volumes in the Tubular Bells field due to a new well and higher production;\n•\nA $24 million increase associated with volumes from Norphlet placed in service in June 2019.\nThe net sum of\nService revenues – commodity consideration, Product sales, Product costs,\nand\nProcessing commodity expenses\ncomprise our commodity margins. Our commodity margins associated with our equity NGLs decreased $11 million driven by lower commodity prices and volumes.  Additionally, the decrease in\nProduct sales\nincludes a $47 million decrease in commodity marketing sales due to lower NGL prices and volumes and $27 million lower system management gas sales. Marketing sales and system management gas sales are substantially offset in\nProduct costs\nand therefore have little impact to\nModified EBITDA.\nOther segment costs and expenses\ndecreased primarily due to lower employee-related expenses, including the absence of 2019 severance and related costs and the associated reduced costs in 2020, as well as the favorable impact of a change in an employee benefit policy (see Note 6 – Other Income and Expenses\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), lower maintenance costs primarily due to a decrease in contracted services related to general maintenance and other testing at Transco, the absence of a 2019 charge for reversal of costs capitalized in previous periods and net favorable changes to charges and credits associated with a regulatory asset related to Transco’s asset retirement obligations, partially offset by lower equity AFUDC and higher operating taxes.\nImpairment of certain assets\nincludes the absence of the impairment of our Constitution development project in 2019, partially offset by the impairment of our Northeast Supply Enhancement development project in 2020 (see Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nProportional Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments\ndecreased at Discovery driven by lower volumes due to scheduled maintenance and temporary shut-ins related to Gulf of Mexico weather-related events and pricing.\n2019 vs. 2018\nTransmission & Gulf of Mexico Modified EBITDA\ndecreased primarily due to the impairment of Constitution, the absence of a 2018\nGain on sale of certain assets and businesses\n, and higher\nOther segment costs and expenses\n, partially offset by increased\nService revenues\nrelated to expansion projects placed into service during 2018 and 2019.\nService revenues\nincreased primarily due to a $403 million increase in Transco’s natural gas transportation revenues primarily driven by a $358 million increase related to expansion projects placed in service in 2018 and 2019, as well as higher revenue associated with Transco’s general rate case settlement and increased amounts for reimbursable power and storage expenses. Partially offsetting these increases were lower fee revenues of $62 million primarily due to producer operational issues and lower deferred revenue amortization at Gulfstar One, as well as the sale of certain Gulf Coast pipeline assets in fourth-quarter 2018.\nThe net sum of\nService revenues – commodity consideration, Product sales, Product costs,\nand\nProcessing commodity expenses\ncomprise our commodity margins. Our commodity margins associated with our equity NGLs decreased $16 million, consisting of a $26 million decrease associated with unfavorable net realized NGL sales prices, partially offset by a $10 million increase associated with higher sales volumes.  The higher NGL volumes were primarily related to the absence of 2018 downtime to modify the Mobile Bay processing plant for the Norphlet project. Additionally, the decrease in\nProduct sales\nincludes a $93 million decrease in commodity marketing sales due to lower NGL prices and volumes and a $39 million decrease in system management gas sales. Marketing sales\n54\nand system management gas sales are substantially offset in\nProduct costs\nand therefore have little impact to\nModified EBITDA.\nOther segment costs and expenses\nincreased primarily due a $56 million unfavorable change in Transco’s equity AFUDC due to lower construction activity, a $39 million charge in 2019 for severance and related costs primarily associated with our 2019 VSP, a $21 million increase in reimbursable power and storage expenses, $16 million of expense in 2019 related to the reversal of expenditures previously capitalized, and the absence of a $12 million 2018 gain on asset retirements. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by $77 million of net favorable changes to charges and credits associated with regulatory assets and liabilities, which were significantly driven by the previously mentioned settlement in Transco’s general rate case, a $46 million decrease in Transco’s contracted services compared to 2018 mainly due to the timing of required engine overhauls and integrity testing, and the absence of a 2018 unfavorable charge of $12 million for a regulatory liability associated with a decrease in Northwest Pipeline’s estimated deferred state income tax rate following the WPZ Merger.\nImpairment of certain assets\nincludes the 2019 impairment of our Constitution development project (see                       Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nGain on sale of certain assets and businesses\nreflects an $81 million gain from the sale of our Gulf Coast pipeline system assets in fourth-quarter 2018 (see Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nNortheast G&P\n2020 vs. 2019\nNortheast G&P Modified EBITDA\nincreased primarily due to higher\nService revenues,\nlower\nOther segment costs and expenses,\nand increased\nProportional Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments\n, in addition to the favorable impact of acquiring the additional interest in UEOM, which is a consolidated entity after the remaining ownership interest was purchased in March 2019.\nService revenues\nincreased primarily due to:\n•\nA $94 million increase at the Northeast JV, including $62 million higher processing, fractionation, transportation, and gathering revenues primarily due to higher volumes and a $32 million increase associated with the consolidation of UEOM, as previously discussed;\n55\n•\nA $20 million increase in gathering revenues associated with higher volumes in the Utica Shale region;\n•\nA $13 million increase in revenues associated with reimbursable electricity expenses, which is offset by similar changes in electricity charges, reflected in\nOther segment costs and expenses.\nProduct sales\ndecreased primarily due to lower NGL volumes and prices within our marketing activities, and lower system management gas sales. Marketing sales and system management gas sales are offset by similar changes in marketing purchases and system management gas purchases, reflected above as\nProduct costs\n, and therefore have little impact to\nModified EBITDA\n.\nOther segment costs and expenses\ndecreased due to lower employee-related expenses, including the absence of 2019 severance and related costs and the associated reduced costs in 2020, as well as the favorable impact of a change in an employee benefit policy (see Note 6 – Other Income and Expenses of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), and lower maintenance and operating expenses primarily due to timing and scope of activities. Additionally, expenses changed favorably due to the absence of transaction costs associated with our 2019 acquisition of UEOM and the formation of the Northeast JV. These decreases were partially offset by higher reimbursable electricity expenses, increased expenses associated with the consolidation of UEOM, and the absence of a favorable customer settlement in 2019.\nImpairment of certain assets\nincludes a $12 million impairment of certain gathering assets in the Marcellus Shale region in 2020 and a $10 million write-down of other certain assets that were no longer in use or were surplus in nature in 2019 (see Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nProportional Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments\nincreased at Appalachia Midstream Investments driven by higher volumes, partially offset by a $26 million decrease for our share of an impairment of certain assets. Additionally, there was an increase at Blue Racer/Caiman II primarily due to higher volumes and the favorable impact of increased ownership, partially offset by a $10 million decrease for our share of an impairment of certain assets. These increases were partially offset by a $16 million decrease as a result of the consolidation of UEOM in 2019, as previously discussed, as well as a decrease at Laurel Mountain primarily due to $11 million for our share of an impairment of certain assets that were subsequently sold, partially offset by higher volumes, and a decrease at Aux Sable.\n2019 vs. 2018\nNortheast G&P Modified EBITDA\nincreased primarily due to higher\nService revenues\ndue to increased gathering volumes, as well as the $38 million favorable impact of acquiring the additional interest in UEOM, partially offset by 2019 impairments.\nService revenues\nincreased primarily due to:\n•\nA $158 million increase associated with the consolidation of UEOM, as previously discussed;\n•\nA $102 million increase associated with higher gathering revenues at Susquehanna Supply Hub reflecting 18 percent higher gathering volumes due to increased production from customers and higher rates;\n•\nA $49 million increase at Ohio Valley Midstream primarily due to higher gathering, processing, and transportation volumes;\n•\nA $36 million increase in gathering revenues in the Utica Shale region due to higher rates and volumes from new wells;\n•\nA $14 million increase in compression revenues for services charged to an affiliate driven by higher volumes.\nProduct sales\ndecreased primarily due to lower non-ethane volumes and prices within our marketing activities. The changes in marketing revenues are offset by similar changes in marketing purchases, reflected above as\nProduct costs\n.\n56\nOther segment costs and expenses\nincreased primarily due to:\n•\nA $53 million increase associated with the consolidation of UEOM;\n•\nA $10 million increase related to transaction expenses associated with the acquisition of UEOM and the formation of the Northeast JV;\n•\nA $7 million charge in 2019 for severance and related costs primarily associated with our VSP.\nImpairment of certain assets\nincreased due to a $10 million write-down of other certain assets that are no longer in use or are surplus in nature in 2019 (see Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nProportional Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments\ndecreased $59 million as a result of the consolidation of UEOM and $10 million due to unfavorable rates reflecting lower NGL prices at Aux Sable. This decrease was partially offset by a $29 million increase at Appalachia Midstream Investments, reflecting higher volumes due to increased customer production.\nWest\n2020 vs. 2019\nWest Modified EBITDA\nincreased primarily due to the absence of\nImpairment of certain assets\nand lower\nOther segment costs and expenses\n, partially offset by lower\nService revenues\n.\nService revenues\ndecreased primarily due to:\n•\nAn $83 million decrease associated with lower volumes, excluding the Eagle Ford Shale region;\n•\nA $72 million decrease driven by lower deferred revenue amortization and MVC deficiency fee revenues associated with the second-quarter 2019 expiration of the MVC agreement in the Barnett Shale region;\n•\nA $47 million decrease associated with lower rates, excluding the Eagle Ford Shale region, driven by lower commodity pricing in the Barnett Shale region and the expiration of a cost-of-service period on a contract in the Mid-Continent region;\n•\nAn $11 million decrease associated with lower fractionation fees driven by lower volumes;\n57\n•\nAn $8 million decrease driven by the absence of a favorable 2019 cost-of-service agreement adjustment in the Mid-Continent region; partially offset by\n•\nA $91 million increase in the Eagle Ford Shale region due to higher MVC revenue and higher rates, partially offset by lower volumes primarily due to decreased producer activity, including temporary shut-ins on certain gathering systems;\n•\nA $29 million increase associated with a temporary volume deficiency fee associated with reduced volumes from a shipper on OPPL;\n•\nA $26 million increase in the Wamsutter region associated with higher MVC revenue.\nThe net sum of\nService revenues\n–\ncommodity consideration, Product sales, Product costs,\nand\nProcessing commodity expenses\ncomprise our commodity margins, which we further segregate into product margins associated with our equity NGLs and marketing margins. Product margins from our equity NGLs decreased $29 million primarily due to:\n•\nA $35 million decrease associated with lower sales prices primarily due to 25 percent lower average net realized per-unit non-ethane sales prices;\n•\nA $15 million decrease primarily associated with 14 percent lower non-ethane sales volumes driven by less producer drilling activity; partially offset by\n•\nA $21 million increase related to a decline in natural gas purchases associated with equity NGL production due to lower natural gas prices and lower equity non-ethane production volumes.\nAdditionally, marketing margins increased by $23 million primarily due to favorable changes in net commodity prices. The decrease in\nProduct sales\nincludes a $168 million decrease in marketing sales, which is due to lower sales prices, partially offset by higher marketing sales volumes. An $18 million decrease in other product sales also contributed to the overall decrease. These decreases are substantially offset in\nProduct costs.\nOther segment costs and expenses\ndecreased primarily due to lower employee-related expenses driven by the absence of 2019 severance and related costs and the associated reduced costs in 2020, and the  favorable impact of a change in an employee benefit policy (see Note 6 – Other Income and Expenses\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), as well as lower operating costs due to fewer leased compressors and lower maintenance costs primarily due to timing and scope of activities. These favorable changes are partially offset by the absence of $12 million in favorable settlements in 2019.\nImpairment of certain assets\ndecreased primarily due to the absence of a $79 million impairment of certain Eagle Ford Shale gathering assets and a $12 million impairment of certain idle gathering assets in 2019 (see       Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nProportional Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments\ndecreased primarily due to lower volumes at OPPL and the absence of the Jackalope equity-method investment sold in April 2019, partially offset by growth at the RMM, Brazos Permian II, and Targa Train 7 equity-method investments.\n2019 vs. 2018\nWest Modified EBITDA\nincreased primarily due to lower\nImpairment of certain assets\nand lower\nOther segment costs and expenses,\npartially offset by a lower gain on sale of certain assets in 2019, lower\nService revenues,\nand lower commodity margins.\nService revenues\ndecreased primarily due to:\n•\nA $218 million decrease associated with asset divestitures and deconsolidations during 2018 and 2019, including our former Four Corners area assets, certain Delaware basin assets that were contributed to our\n58\nBrazos Permian II equity-method investment, and our Jackalope assets which were deconsolidated in second-quarter 2018 and subsequently sold in second-quarter 2019;\n•\nA $57 million decrease driven by lower deferred revenue amortization and MVC deficiency fee revenues in the Barnett Shale region primarily associated with the expiration of a certain MVC agreement;\n•\nA $17 million decrease driven by lower gathering volumes primarily in the Mid-Continent, Barnett Shale, and Wamsutter regions, partially offset by higher gathering volumes primarily in the Haynesville Shale and Eagle Ford regions;\n•\nA $15 million decrease associated with lower processing rates primarily driven by lower commodity pricing in the Piceance region;\n•\nA $15 million decrease associated with lower gathering rates primarily in the Mid-Continent and Haynesville Shale regions; partially offset by\n•\nA $17 million increase related to other MVC deficiency fee revenues;\n•\nA $13 million increase related to higher fractionation and storage fees;\n•\nAn $8 million increase associated with the resolution of a prior period performance obligation.\nThe net sum of\nService revenues\n–\ncommodity consideration, Product sales, Product costs,\nand\nProcessing commodity expenses\ncomprise our commodity margins. Our commodity margins associated with our equity NGLs decreased by $127 million primarily due to:\n•\nA $98 million decrease associated with lower sales volumes, consisting of $54 million related to the absence of our former Four Corners area assets and $44 million due to 12 percent lower non-ethane volumes and 33 percent lower ethane sales volumes primarily due to higher ethane rejection in 2019, natural declines, less producer drilling activity, and more severe weather conditions in first-quarter 2019;\n•\nA $66 million decrease associated with lower sales prices primarily due to 29 percent and 48 percent lower average net realized per-unit non-ethane and ethane sales prices, respectively; partially offset by\n•\nA $37 million increase related to lower natural gas purchases associated with lower equity NGL production volumes and lower natural gas prices, including $9 million related to the absence of our former Four Corners area assets.\nAdditionally, the decrease in\nProduct sales\nincludes a $447 million decrease in marketing sales, which is due to lower sales prices, partially offset by higher sales volumes, and a $36 million decrease related to the sale of other products. These decreases are substantially offset in\nProduct costs.\nMarketing margins increased by $27 million primarily due to favorable changes in prices.\nOther segment costs and expenses\ndecreased primarily due to a $127 million reduction associated with the absence of our former Four Corners area assets and from the Jackalope deconsolidation in second-quarter 2018, $12 million favorable settlements in 2019, as well as $7 million lower ad valorem taxes. These decreases were partially offset by an unfavorable charge in 2019 for severance and related costs primarily associated with our VSP of $10 million.\nImpairment of certain assets\ndecreased primarily due to the absence of the $1.849 billion Barnett impairment in in 2018, partially offset by small impairment charges in 2019 (see Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nThe decrease in\nGain on sale of certain assets and businesses\nreflects the absence of the gain from the sale of our Four Corners area assets recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 (see Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n59\nProportional Modified EBITDA of equity-method investments\nincreased primarily due to the additions of the RMM and Brazos Permian II equity-method investments in the second half of 2018, partially offset by the sale of our Jackalope investment in second-quarter 2019.\nOther\n2020 vs. 2019\nOther Modified EBITDA\ndecreased primarily due to:\n•\nA $24 million charge in fourth quarter of 2020 related to a legal settlement associated with former olefins operations;\n•\nA charge of $15 million related to the write-offs of certain regulatory assets associated with cancelled projects in 2020; partially offset by\n•\nThe absence of a $12 million unfavorable adjustment to a regulatory asset associated with an increase in Transco’s estimated deferred state income tax rate following the WPZ Merger.\n2019 vs. 2018\nOther Modified EBITDA\nincreased primarily due to:\n•\nThe absence of the $66 million impairment of certain idle pipelines in the second quarter of 2018 (see                      Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements);\n•\nThe absence of a $35 million charge in 2018 associated with a charitable contribution of preferred stock to The Williams Companies Foundation, Inc. (a not-for-profit corporation) (see Note 16 – Stockholders' Equity of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements);\n•\nThe absence of $20 million in costs in 2018 associated with the WPZ Merger (see Note 1 – General, Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements);\n•\nAn $8 million increase related to the absence of 2018 unfavorable Modified EBITDA associated with the results of certain of our former Gulf Coast area operations sold in 2018;\n•\nThe absence of a $7 million loss on early retirement of debt in 2018.\nThese increases were partially offset by:\n•\nThe absence of a $37 million benefit of establishing a regulatory asset associated with an increase in Transco’s estimated deferred state income tax rate following the WPZ Merger in 2018 and a subsequent unfavorable $12 million adjustment in the first quarter of 2019;\n•\nA $26 million decrease in income associated with a regulatory asset related to deferred taxes on equity funds used during construction;\n•\nThe absence of a $20 million gain on the sale of certain assets and operations located in the Gulf Coast area in 2018 (see Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\n60\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Liquidity\nOverview\nAs previously discussed, we have continued to focus on earnings and cash flow growth, while continuing to improve leverage metrics and control operating costs. During 2020, we retired approximately $2.1 billion of long-term debt and issued approximately $2.2 billion of new long-term debt. In July 2020, we paid $284 million for rate refunds related to Transco’s increased rates collected since the new rates became effective in March 2019. In 2020, we acquired substantially all of the remaining outstanding ownership interests in Caiman II for approximately $157 million, net of cash acquired. See also the section titled\nSources (Uses) of Cash\n.\nOutlook\nAs previously discussed in Company Outlook, our growth capital and investment expenditures in 2021 are currently expected to be in a range from $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion. Growth capital spending in 2021 primarily includes Transco expansions, all of which are fully contracted with firm transportation agreements, and projects supporting the Northeast G&P business and opportunities in the Haynesville area. In addition to growth capital and investment expenditures, we also remain committed to projects that maintain our assets for safe and reliable operations, as well as projects that meet legal, regulatory, and/or contractual commitments. We intend to fund substantially all of our planned 2021 capital spending with cash available after paying dividends. We retain the flexibility to adjust planned levels of growth capital and investment expenditures in response to changes in economic conditions or business opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have $893 million of long-term debt due within one year. Our potential sources of liquidity available to address these maturities include proceeds from refinancing at attractive long-term rates or from our credit facility, as well as proceeds from asset monetizations.\nLiquidity\nBased on our forecasted levels of cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity, we expect to have sufficient liquidity to manage our businesses in 2021. Our potential material internal and external sources and uses of liquidity are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $21.5 billion of long-term debt due after one year. See    Note 14 – Debt and Banking Arrangements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the aggregate maturities over the next five years. Our potential sources of liquidity available to address these maturities include cash generated from operations, proceeds from refinancing at attractive long-term rates or from our credit facility, as well as proceeds from asset monetizations.\n61\nPotential risks associated with our planned levels of liquidity discussed above include those previously discussed in Company Outlook\n.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had a working capital deficit of $890 million, including cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt due within one year. Our available liquidity is as follows:\n__________\n(1)\nIn managing our available liquidity, we do not expect a maximum outstanding amount in excess of the capacity of our credit facility inclusive of any outstanding amounts under our commercial paper program. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The highest amount outstanding under our commercial paper program and credit facility during 2020 was $1.7 billion. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the financial covenants associated with our credit facility. See Note 14 – Debt and Banking Arrangements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our credit facility and commercial paper program.\nDividends\nWe increased our regular quarterly cash dividend to common stockholders by approximately 5 percent from the $0.38 per share paid in each quarter of 2019, to $0.40 per share paid in each quarter of 2020.\nRegistrations\nTo replace our recently expired shelf registration statement, we anticipate filing a new shelf registration statement as a well-known seasoned issuer.\nDistributions from Equity-Method Investees\nThe organizational documents of entities in which we have an equity-method investment generally require periodic distributions of their available cash to their members. In each case, available cash is reduced, in part, by reserves appropriate for operating their respective businesses. See Note 7 – Investing Activities of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our more significant equity-method investees.\nCredit Ratings\nThe interest rates at which we are able to borrow money are impacted by our credit ratings. The current ratings are as follows:\nIn November 2020, Fitch Ratings upgraded our credit rating from BBB- to BBB. In January 2021, Moody’s changed our Outlook from Stable to Positive.\nThese credit ratings are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. No assurance can be given that the credit rating agencies will continue to assign us investment-grade ratings even if we meet or exceed their current\n62\ncriteria for investment-grade ratios. A downgrade of our credit ratings might increase our future cost of borrowing and would require us to provide additional collateral to third parties, negatively impacting our available liquidity.\nSources (Uses) of Cash\nThe following table summarizes the sources (uses) of cash and cash equivalents for each of the periods presented (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Notes referenced in the table):\nOperating activities\nThe factors that determine operating activities are largely the same as those that affect\nNet income (loss)\n, with the exception of noncash items such as\nDepreciation and amortization\n,\nProvision (benefit) for deferred income taxes\n,\nEquity (earnings) losses\n,\nGain on disposition of equity-method investments\n, (\nGain) on sale of certain assets and businesses\n, (\nGain) loss on deconsolidation of businesses\n,\nImpairment of goodwill\n,\nImpairment of equity-method investments\n, and\nImpairment of certain assets.\nOur\nNet cash provided (used) by operating activities\nin 2020 decreased from 2019 primarily due to the net unfavorable changes in net operating working capital in 2020, including the payment of Transco’s rate refunds in 2020 and the decrease in the income tax refund that was received in 2020 compared to that received in 2019, partially offset by higher operating income (excluding noncash items as previously discussed) in 2020.\nOur\nNet cash provided (used) by operating activities\nin 2019 increased from 2018 primarily due to the net favorable changes in operating working capital in 2019, including the collection of Transco’s filed rates subject to refund and the receipt of an income tax refund, as well as higher operating income (excluding noncash items as previously discussed) in 2019, partially offset by the impact of decreased distributions from unconsolidated affiliates in 2019.\n63\nEnvironmental\nWe are a participant in certain environmental activities in various stages including assessment studies, cleanup operations, and/or remedial processes at certain sites, some of which we currently do not own (see Note 19 – Contingent Liabilities and Commitments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We are monitoring these sites in a coordinated effort with other potentially responsible parties, the EPA, or other governmental authorities. We are jointly and severally liable along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities and solely responsible in others. Current estimates of the most likely costs of such activities are approximately $33 million, all of which are included in\nAccrued liabilities\nand\nRegulatory liabilities, deferred income, and other\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020. We will seek recovery of the accrued costs related to remediation activities by our interstate gas pipelines totaling approximately $4 million through future natural gas transmission rates. The remainder of these costs will be funded from operations. During 2020, we paid approximately $3 million for cleanup and/or remediation and monitoring activities. We expect to pay approximately $11 million in 2021 for these activities. Estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally based on completed assessment studies, preliminary results of studies, or our experience with other similar cleanup operations. At December 31, 2020, certain assessment studies were still in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield different estimates of most likely costs. Therefore, the actual costs incurred will depend on the final amount, type, and extent of contamination discovered at these sites, the final cleanup standards mandated by the EPA or other governmental authorities, and other factors.\nThe EPA and various state regulatory agencies routinely promulgate and propose new rules and issue updated guidance to existing rules. These rulemakings include, but are not limited to, rules for reciprocating internal combustion engine and combustion turbine maximum achievable control technology, air quality standards for one-hour nitrogen dioxide emissions, and volatile organic compound and methane new source performance standards impacting design and operation of storage vessels, pressure valves, and compressors. The EPA previously issued its rule regarding National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ground-level ozone. We are monitoring the rule's implementation as it will trigger additional federal and state regulatory actions that may impact our operations. Implementation of the regulations is expected to result in impacts to our operations and increase the cost of additions to\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nfor both new and existing facilities in affected areas. We are unable to reasonably estimate the cost of additions that may be required to meet the regulations at this time due to uncertainty created by various legal challenges to these regulations and the need for further specific regulatory guidance.\nOur interstate natural gas pipelines consider prudently incurred environmental assessment and remediation costs and the costs associated with compliance with environmental standards to be recoverable through rates.\n64"

Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, references to “Williams,” “we,” “our,” and “us” include the operations in which we own interests accounted for as equity-method investments that are not consolidated in our financial statements. When we refer to our equity investees by name, we are referring exclusively to their businesses and operations.\nWPZ Merger\nOn August 10, 2018, we completed our merger with Williams Partners L.P. (WPZ), our previously consolidated master limited partnership, pursuant to which we acquired all of the approximately\n256\nmillion publicly held outstanding common units of WPZ in exchange for\n382\nmillion shares of our common stock (WPZ Merger). Williams continued as the surviving entity. The WPZ Merger was accounted for as a noncash equity transaction resulting in increases to\nCommon stock\nof $\n382\nmillion,\nCapital in excess of par value\nof $\n6.112\nbillion, and\nRegulatory assets, deferred charges, and other\nof $\n33\nmillion and decreases to\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n(AOCI) of $\n3\nmillion,\nNoncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries\nof $\n4.629\nbillion, and\nDeferred income tax liabilities\nof $\n1.829\nbillion in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Prior to the completion of the WPZ Merger and pursuant to its distribution reinvestment program, WPZ had issued common units to the public in 2018 associated with reinvested distributions of $\n46\nmillion.\nDescription of Business\nWe are a Delaware corporation whose common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Our operations are located in the United States. Our operations are presented within the following reportable segments: Transmission & Gulf of Mexico, Northeast G&P, and West, consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates performance and allocates resources. All remaining business activities as well as corporate activities are included in Other.\nTransmission & Gulf of Mexico is comprised of our interstate natural gas pipelines, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco) and Northwest Pipeline LLC (Northwest Pipeline), as well as natural gas gathering and processing and crude oil production handling and transportation assets in the Gulf Coast region, including a\n51\npercent interest in Gulfstar One LLC (Gulfstar One) (a consolidated variable interest entity, or VIE), which is a proprietary floating production system, a\n50\npercent equity-method investment in Gulfstream Natural Gas System, L.L.C. (Gulfstream), and a\n60\npercent equity-method investment in Discovery Producer Services LLC (Discovery).\nNortheast G&P is comprised of our midstream gathering, processing, and fractionation businesses in the Marcellus Shale region primarily in Pennsylvania and New York, and the Utica Shale region of eastern Ohio, as well as a\n65\npercent interest in Ohio Valley Midstream LLC (Northeast JV) (a consolidated VIE) which operates in West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, a\n66\npercent interest in Cardinal Gas Services, L.L.C. (Cardinal) (a consolidated VIE) which operates in Ohio, a\n69\npercent equity-method investment in Laurel Mountain Midstream, LLC (Laurel Mountain), a\n99\npercent interest in Caiman Energy II, LLC (Caiman II) (a former equity-method investment which is a consolidated entity following our November 2020 acquisition of an additional ownership interest and was subsequently renamed Blue Racer Midstream Holdings, LLC) which owns a\n50\npercent equity-method investment in Blue Racer Midstream LLC (Blue Racer) (see Note 7 – Investing Activities), and Appalachia Midstream Services, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary that owns equity-method investments with an approximate average\n66\npercent interest in multiple gas gathering systems in the Marcellus Shale region (Appalachia Midstream Investments).\n75\nWest is comprised of our gas gathering, processing, and treating operations in the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado and Wyoming, the Barnett Shale region of north-central Texas, the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas, the Haynesville Shale region of northwest Louisiana, and the Mid-Continent region which includes the Anadarko, Arkoma, and Permian basins. This segment also includes our natural gas liquid (NGL) and natural gas marketing business, storage facilities, an undivided\n50\npercent interest in an NGL fractionator near Conway, Kansas, a\n50\npercent equity-method investment in Overland Pass Pipeline Company LLC (OPPL), a\n50\npercent equity-method investment in Rocky Mountain Midstream Holdings LLC (RMM), a\n20\npercent equity-method investment in Targa Train 7 LLC (Targa Train 7) (a nonconsolidated VIE), and a\n15\npercent interest in Brazos Permian II, LLC (Brazos Permian II) (a nonconsolidated VIE).\nBasis of Presentation\nDiscontinued operations\nUnless indicated otherwise, the information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements relates to our continuing operations.\nSignificant risks and uncertainties\nWe believe that the carrying value of certain of our property, plant, and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets, notably certain acquired assets accounted for as business combinations between 2012 and 2014, may be in excess of current fair value. However, the carrying value of these assets, in our judgment, continues to be recoverable. It is reasonably possible that future strategic decisions, including transactions such as monetizing non-core assets or contributing assets to new ventures with third parties, as well as unfavorable changes in expected producer activities, including effects of financial distress caused by financial and commodity market declines, could impact our assumptions and ultimately result in impairments of these assets. Such transactions or developments may also indicate that certain of our equity-method investments have experienced other-than-temporary declines in value, which could result in impairment.\nCustomer bankruptcy\nIn June 2020, our customer, Chesapeake Energy Corporation (Chesapeake), announced that it had voluntarily filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. We provide midstream services, including wellhead gathering, for the natural gas that Chesapeake and its joint interest owners produce, primarily in the Eagle Ford Shale, Haynesville Shale, and Marcellus Shale regions (through Appalachia Midstream Investments).\nIn November 2020, we reached a global resolution with Chesapeake as part of Chesapeake’s restructuring process.  The resolution was approved by the bankruptcy court in December 2020 and per the terms, Chesapeake paid all outstanding pre-petition amounts due to us. Additional terms include reduced gathering fees in the Haynesville Shale region, continuation of the gathering agreements in the Eagle Ford Shale and Marcellus Shale regions, a long-term gas supply commitment for Transco’s Regional Energy Access pipeline currently under development, and transferring certain natural gas properties in Louisiana to us.  As a result of this resolution, we recorded increases to our other nonregulated property, plant, and equipment of $\n98\nmillion, contract liabilities of $\n67\nmillion (see Note 5 – Revenue Recognition), and asset retirement obligations (AROs) of $\n31\nmillion (see     Note 11 – Property, Plant, and Equipment).\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities that we control and our proportionate interest in the accounts of certain ventures in which we own an undivided interest. Our judgment is required to evaluate whether we control an entity. Key areas of that evaluation include:\n76\n•\nDetermining whether an entity is a VIE;\n•\nDetermining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, including evaluating which activities of the VIE most significantly impact its economic performance and the degree of power that we and our related parties have over those activities through our variable interests;\n•\nIdentifying events that require reconsideration of whether an entity is a VIE and continuously evaluating whether we are a VIE’s primary beneficiary;\n•\nEvaluating whether other owners in entities that are not VIEs are able to effectively participate in significant decisions that would be expected to be made in the ordinary course of business such that we do not have the power to control such entities.\nWe apply the equity method of accounting to investments over which we exercise significant influence but do not control. Distributions received from equity-method investees are presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows according to the nature of the distributions approach, which classifies distributions received from equity-method investees as either returns on investment (cash inflows from operating activities) or returns of investment (cash inflows from investing activities) based on the nature of the activities of the equity-method investee that generated the distribution.\nEquity-method investment basis differences\nDifferences between the cost of our equity-method investments and our underlying equity in the net assets of investees are accounted for as if the investees were consolidated subsidiaries.\nEquity earnings (losses)\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations includes our allocable share of net income (loss) of investees adjusted for any depreciation and amortization, as applicable, associated with basis differences.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions include:\n•\nImpairment assessments of investments, property, plant, and equipment, goodwill, and other identifiable intangible assets;\n•\nLitigation-related contingencies;\n•\nEnvironmental remediation obligations;\n•\nDepreciation and/or amortization of long-lived assets;\n•\nDepreciation and/or amortization of equity-method investment basis differences;\n•\nAROs;\n•\nPension and postretirement valuation variables;\n•\nMeasurement of regulatory liabilities;\n•\nMeasurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, including assumptions related to the realization of deferred income tax assets;\n77\n•\nRevenue recognition, including estimates utilized in recognition of deferred revenue;\n•\nPurchase price accounting.\nThese estimates are discussed further throughout these notes.\nRegulatory accounting\nTransco and Northwest Pipeline are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and their rates are established by the FERC. Therefore, we have determined that it is appropriate under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 980, “Regulated Operations,” (ASC 980) that certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense should be deferred as regulatory assets, based on the expected recovery from customers in future rates. Likewise, certain actual or anticipated credits that would otherwise reduce expense should be deferred as regulatory liabilities, based on the expected return to customers in future rates. Management’s expected recovery of deferred costs and return of deferred credits generally results from specific decisions by regulators granting such ratemaking treatment. We record certain incurred costs and obligations as regulatory assets or liabilities if, based on regulatory orders or other available evidence, it is probable that the costs or obligations will be included in amounts allowable for recovery or refunded in future rates. Accounting for these operations that are regulated can differ from the accounting requirements for nonregulated operations. For example, for regulated operations, allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) represents the estimated cost of debt and equity funds applicable to utility plant in the process of construction and is capitalized as a cost of property, plant, and equipment because it constitutes an actual cost of construction under established regulatory practices; nonregulated operations are only allowed to capitalize the cost of debt funds related to construction activities, while a component for equity is prohibited. The components of our regulatory assets and liabilities relate to the effects of deferred taxes on equity funds used during construction, AROs, shipper imbalance activity, fuel and power cost differentials, levelized incremental depreciation, negative salvage, pension and other postretirement benefits, customer tax refunds, and rate allowances for deferred income taxes at a historically higher federal income tax rate.\nOur current and noncurrent regulatory asset and liability balances for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when acquired.\nAccounts receivable\nAccounts receivable are carried on a gross basis, with no discounting, less an allowance for doubtful accounts. We estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts, considering current expected credit losses (as discussed below in Accounting standards issued and adopted), the financial condition of our customers, and age of past due accounts. We do not offer extended payment terms and typically receive payment within one month. We consider receivables\n78\npast due if full payment is not received by the contractual due date. Interest income related to past due accounts receivable is generally recognized at the time full payment is received or collectability is assured. Past due accounts are generally written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts only after all collection attempts have been exhausted.\nInventories\nInventories\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet primarily consist of NGLs, natural gas in underground storage, and materials and supplies and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of inventories is primarily determined using the average-cost method.\nProperty, plant, and equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment is initially recorded at cost. We base the carrying value of these assets on estimates, assumptions, and judgments relative to capitalized costs, useful lives, and salvage values.\nAs regulated entities, Northwest Pipeline and Transco provide for depreciation using the straight-line method at FERC-prescribed rates. Depreciation for nonregulated entities is provided primarily on the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, except for certain offshore facilities that apply an accelerated depreciation method.\nGains or losses from the ordinary sale or retirement of property, plant, and equipment for regulated pipelines are credited or charged to accumulated depreciation. Other gains or losses are recorded in\nOther (income) expense – net\nincluded in\nOperating income (loss)\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nOrdinary maintenance and repair costs are generally expensed as incurred. Costs of major renewals and replacements are capitalized as property, plant, and equipment.\nWe record a liability and increase the basis in the underlying asset for the present value of each expected future ARO at the time the liability is initially incurred, typically when the asset is acquired or constructed. As regulated entities, Northwest Pipeline and Transco offset the depreciation of the underlying asset that is attributable to capitalized ARO cost to a regulatory asset as we expect to recover these amounts in future rates. We measure changes in the liability due to passage of time by applying an interest rate to the liability balance. This amount is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the liability and as a corresponding accretion expense included in\nOperating and maintenance expenses\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations, except for regulated entities, for which the liability is offset by a regulatory asset. The regulatory asset is amortized commensurate with our collection of those costs in rates.\nMeasurements of AROs include, as a component of future expected costs, an estimate of the price that a third party would demand, and could expect to receive, for bearing the uncertainties inherent in the obligations, sometimes referred to as a market-risk premium.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill included within\nIntangible assets – net of accumulated amortization\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as of December 31, 2019, represents the excess of the consideration, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest or any previously held equity interest, over the fair value of the net assets acquired. It is not subject to amortization but is evaluated annually as of October 1 for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators are present that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. As part of the evaluation, we compare our estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference (not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill). Judgments and assumptions are inherent in our management’s estimates of fair value.\n79\nOther identifiable intangible assets\nOur other identifiable intangible assets included within\nIntangible assets – net of accumulated amortization\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet are primarily related to gas gathering, processing, and fractionation contractual customer relationships. Our other identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period in which these assets contribute to our cash flows. We evaluate these assets for changes in the expected remaining useful lives and would reflect any changes prospectively through amortization over the revised remaining useful life.\nImpairment of property, plant, and equipment, other identifiable intangible assets, and investments\nWe evaluate our property, plant, and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets for impairment when, in our judgment, events or circumstances, including probable abandonment, indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. When an indicator of impairment has occurred, we compare our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets to the carrying value of the assets to determine whether an impairment has occurred and we may apply a probability-weighted approach to consider the likelihood of different cash flow assumptions and possible outcomes including selling in the near term or holding for the remaining estimated useful life. If an impairment of the carrying value has occurred, we determine the amount of the impairment recognized in the financial statements by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. This evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which separately identifiable cash flows exist.\nFor assets identified to be disposed of in the future and considered held for sale, we compare the carrying value to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell to determine if recognition of an impairment is required. Until the assets are disposed of, the estimated fair value, which includes estimated cash flows from operations until the assumed date of sale, is recalculated when related events or circumstances change.\nWe evaluate our investments for impairment when, in our judgment, events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such investments may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. When evidence of loss in value has occurred, we compare our estimate of fair value of the investment to the carrying value of the investment to determine whether an impairment has occurred. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value and we consider the decline in value to be other-than-temporary, the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is recognized in the consolidated financial statements as an impairment charge.\nJudgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows and an asset’s or investment’s fair value. Additionally, judgment is used to determine the probability of sale with respect to assets considered for disposal.\nContingent liabilities\nWe record liabilities for estimated loss contingencies, including environmental matters, when we assess that a loss is probable, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities are calculated based upon our assumptions and estimates with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss and upon advice of legal counsel, engineers, or other third parties regarding the probable outcomes of the matters. These calculations are made without consideration of any potential recovery from third parties. We recognize insurance recoveries or reimbursements from others when realizable. Revisions to these liabilities are generally reflected in income when new or different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect the previous assumptions or estimates.\nCash flows from revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program\nProceeds and payments related to borrowings under our credit facilities are reflected in the financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis. Proceeds and payments related to borrowings under our commercial paper program are reflected in the financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on a net basis, as the outstanding notes generally have maturity dates less than three months from the date of issuance. (See Note 14 – Debt and Banking Arrangements.)\n80\nTreasury stock\nTreasury stock purchases are accounted for under the cost method whereby the entire cost of the acquired stock is recorded as\nTreasury stock, at cost\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Gains and losses on the subsequent reissuance of shares are credited or charged to\nCapital in excess of par value\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet using the average-cost method.\nDerivative instruments and hedging activities\nWe may utilize derivatives to manage a portion of our commodity price risk. These instruments consist primarily of swaps, futures, and forward contracts involving short- and long-term purchases and sales of energy commodities. We report the fair value of derivatives, except those for which the normal purchases and normal sales exception has been elected, in\nOther current assets and deferred charges; Regulatory assets, deferred charges, and other;\nAccrued liabilities\n; or\nRegulatory liabilities, deferred income, and other\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We determine the current and noncurrent classification based on the timing of expected future cash flows of individual trades. We report these amounts on a gross basis. Additionally, we report cash collateral receivables and payables with our counterparties on a gross basis.\nThe accounting for the changes in fair value of a commodity derivative can be summarized as follows:\nWe may elect the normal purchases and normal sales exception for certain short- and long-term purchases and sales of physical energy commodities. Under accrual accounting, any change in the fair value of these derivatives is not reflected on the balance sheet after the initial election of the exception.\nWe may also designate a hedging relationship for certain commodity derivatives. For a derivative to qualify for designation in a hedging relationship, it must meet specific criteria and we must maintain appropriate documentation. We establish hedging relationships pursuant to our risk management policies. We evaluate the hedging relationships at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis to determine whether the hedging relationship is, and is expected to remain, highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the underlying risk being hedged. We also regularly assess whether the hedged forecasted transaction is probable of occurring. If a derivative ceases to be or is no longer expected to be highly effective, or if we believe the likelihood of occurrence of the hedged forecasted transaction is no longer probable, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively, and future changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized currently in\nProduct sales\nor\nProduct costs\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nFor commodity derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge, the change in fair value of the derivative is reported in AOCI in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged item affects earnings. Gains or losses deferred in AOCI associated with terminated derivatives, derivatives that cease to be highly effective hedges, derivatives for which the forecasted transaction is reasonably possible but no longer probable of occurring, and cash flow hedges that have been otherwise discontinued remain in AOCI until the hedged item affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction designated as the hedged item in a cash flow hedge will not occur, any gain or loss deferred in AOCI is recognized in\nProduct sales\nor\nProduct costs\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations at that time. The change in likelihood of a forecasted transaction is a judgmental decision that includes qualitative assessments made by us.\nFor commodity derivatives that are not designated in a hedging relationship, and for which we have not elected the normal purchases and normal sales exception, we report changes in fair value currently in\nProduct sales\nor\nProduct costs\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations\n.\n81\nCertain gains and losses on derivative instruments included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations are netted together to a single net gain or loss, while other gains and losses are reported on a gross basis. Gains and losses recorded on a net basis include unrealized gains and losses on all derivatives that are not designated as hedges and for which we have not elected the normal purchases and normal sales exception.\nRealized gains and losses on derivatives that (1) require physical delivery, (2) are used for managing commodity risk on NGL processing or natural gas production activities, and (3) are not held for trading purposes nor were entered into as a pre-contemplated buy/sell arrangement, are recorded on a gross basis.\nRevenue recognition\nCustomers in our gas pipeline businesses are comprised of public utilities, municipalities, gas marketers and producers, intrastate pipelines, direct industrial users, and electrical power generators. Customers in our midstream businesses are comprised of oil and natural gas producer counterparties. Customers for our product sales are comprised of public utilities, gas marketers, and direct industrial users.\nService revenue contracts from our gas pipeline and midstream businesses contain a series of distinct services, with the majority of our contracts having a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by our performance. Most of our product sales contracts have a single performance obligation with revenue recognized at a point in time when the products have been sold and delivered to the customer.\nCertain customers reimburse us for costs we incur associated with construction of property, plant, and equipment utilized in our operations. For our rate-regulated gas pipeline businesses that apply ASC 980, we follow FERC guidelines with respect to reimbursement of construction costs. FERC tariffs only allow for cost reimbursement and are non-negotiable in nature; thus, in our judgment, the construction activities do not represent an ongoing major and central operation of our gas pipeline businesses and are not within the scope of ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (ASC 606). Accordingly, cost reimbursements are treated as a reduction to the cost of the constructed asset. For our midstream businesses, reimbursement and service contracts with customers are viewed together as providing the same commercial objective, as we have the ability to negotiate the mix of consideration between reimbursements and amounts billed over time. Accordingly, we generally recognize reimbursements of construction costs from customers on a gross basis as a contract liability separate from the associated costs included within property, plant, and equipment. The contract liability is recognized into service revenues as the underlying performance obligations are satisfied.\nService Revenues\nGas pipeline businesses:\nRevenues from our regulated interstate natural gas pipeline businesses, which are subject to regulation by certain state and federal authorities, including the FERC, include both firm and interruptible transportation and storage contracts. Firm transportation and storage agreements provide for a fixed reservation charge based on the pipeline or storage capacity reserved, and a commodity charge based on the volume of natural gas delivered/stored, each at rates specified in our FERC tariffs or based on negotiated contractual rates, with contract terms that are generally long-term in nature. Most of our long-term contracts contain an evergreen provision, which allows the contracts to be extended for periods primarily up to one year in length an indefinite number of times following the specified contract term and until terminated generally by either us or the customer. Interruptible transportation and storage agreements provide for a volumetric charge based on actual commodity transportation or storage utilized in the period in which those services are provided, and the contracts are generally limited to one-month periods or less. Our performance obligations related to our interstate natural gas pipeline businesses include the following:\n•\nFirm transportation or storage under firm transportation and storage contracts—an integrated package of services typically constituting a single performance obligation, which includes standing ready to provide such services and receiving, transporting or storing (as applicable), and redelivering commodities;\n82\n•\nInterruptible transportation or storage under interruptible transportation and storage contracts—an integrated package of services typically constituting a single performance obligation once scheduled, which includes receiving, transporting or storing (as applicable), and redelivering commodities.\nIn situations where, in our judgment, we consider the integrated package of services as a single performance obligation, which represents a majority of our interstate natural gas pipeline contracts with customers, we do not consider there to be multiple performance obligations because the nature of the overall promise in the contract is to stand ready (with regard to firm transportation and storage contracts), receive, transport or store, and redeliver natural gas to the customer; therefore, revenue is recognized over time upon satisfaction of our daily stand ready performance obligation.\nWe recognize revenues for reservation charges over the performance obligation period, which is the contract term, regardless of the volume of natural gas that is transported or stored. Revenues for commodity charges from both firm and interruptible transportation services and storage services are recognized when natural gas is delivered at the agreed upon delivery point or when natural gas is injected or withdrawn from the storage facility because they specifically relate to our efforts to provide these distinct services. Generally, reservation charges and commodity charges in our interstate natural gas pipeline businesses are recognized as revenue in the same period they are invoiced to our customers. As a result of the ratemaking process, certain amounts collected by us may be subject to refund upon the issuance of final orders by the FERC in pending rate proceedings. We use judgment to record estimates of rate refund liabilities considering our and other third-party regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel, and other risks.\nMidstream businesses:\nRevenues from our non-regulated gathering, processing, transportation, and storage midstream businesses include contracts for natural gas gathering, processing, treating, compression, transportation, and other related services with contract terms that are generally long-term in nature and may extend up to the production life of the associated reservoir. Additionally, our midstream businesses generate revenues from fees charged for storing customers’ natural gas and NGLs, generally under prepaid contracted storage capacity contracts. In situations where, in our judgment, we provide an integrated package of services combined into a single performance obligation, which represents a majority of this class of contracts with customers, we do not consider there to be multiple performance obligations because the nature of the overall promise in the contract is to provide gathering, processing, transportation, storage, and related services resulting in the delivery, or redelivery in the context of storage services, of pipeline-quality natural gas and NGLs to the customer. As such, revenue is recognized at the daily completion of the integrated package of services as the integrated package represents a single performance obligation. Additionally, certain contracts in our midstream businesses contain fixed or upfront payment terms that result in the deferral of revenues until such services have been performed or such capacity has been made available.\nWe also earn revenues from offshore crude oil and natural gas gathering and transportation and offshore production handling. These services represent an integrated package of services and are considered a single distinct performance obligation for which we recognize revenues as the services are provided to the customer.\nWe generally earn a contractually stated fee per unit for the volume of product transported, gathered, processed, or stored. The rate is generally fixed; however, certain contracts contain variable rates that are subject to change based on commodity prices, levels of throughput, or an annual adjustment based on a formulaic cost of service calculation. In addition, we have contracts with contractually stated fees that decline over the contract term, such as declines based on the passage of time periods or achievement of cumulative throughput amounts. For all of our contracts, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the judgmentally determined relative standalone selling price. The excess of consideration received over revenue recognized results in the deferral of those amounts until future periods based on a units of production or straight-line methodology as these methods appropriately match the consumption of services provided to the customer. The units of production methodology requires the use of production estimates that are uncertain and the use of judgment when developing estimates of future production volumes, thus impacting the rate of revenue recognition.  Production estimates are monitored as circumstances and events warrant. Certain\n83\nof our gas gathering and processing agreements have minimum volume commitments (MVC). If a customer under such an agreement fails to meet its MVC for a specified period (thus not exercising all the contractual rights to gathering and processing services within the specified period, herein referred to as “breakage”), it is obligated to pay a contractually determined fee based upon the shortfall between the actual gathered or processed volumes and the MVC for the period contained in the contract. When we conclude, based on management’s judgment, it is probable that the customer will not exercise all or a portion of its remaining rights, we recognize revenue associated with such breakage amount in proportion to the pattern of exercised rights within the respective MVC period.\nUnder keep-whole and percent-of-liquids processing contracts, we receive commodity consideration in the form of NGLs and take title to the NGLs at the tailgate of the plant. We recognize such commodity consideration as service revenue based on the market value of the NGLs retained at the time the processing is provided. The current market value, as opposed to the market value at the contract inception date, is used due to a combination of factors, including the fact that the volume, mix, and market price of NGL consideration to be received is unknown at the time of contract execution and is not specified in our contracts with customers. Additionally, product sales revenue (discussed below) is recognized upon the sale of the NGLs to a third party based on the sales price at the time of sale. As a result, revenue is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations both at the time the processing service is provided in\nService revenues – commodity consideration\nand at the time the NGLs retained as part of the processing service are sold in\nProduct sales\n. The recognition of revenue related to commodity consideration has the impact of increasing the book value of NGL inventory, resulting in higher cost of goods sold at the time of sale. Given that most inventory is sold in the same period that it is generated, the impact of these transactions is expected to have little impact to operating income.\nProduct Sales\nIn the course of providing transportation services to customers of our gas pipeline businesses and gathering and processing services to customers of our midstream businesses, we may receive different quantities of natural gas from customers than the quantities delivered on behalf of those customers. The resulting imbalances are primarily settled through the purchase or sale of natural gas with each customer under terms provided for in our FERC tariffs or gathering and processing agreements, respectively. Revenue is recognized from the sale of natural gas upon settlement of imbalances.\nIn certain instances, we purchase NGLs, crude oil, and natural gas from our oil and natural gas producer customers which we remarket. In addition, we retain NGLs as consideration in certain processing arrangements, as discussed above in the Service Revenues - Midstream businesses section. We recognize revenue from the sale of these commodities when the products have been sold and delivered. Our product sales contracts are primarily short-term contracts based on prevailing market rates at the time of the transaction.\nContract Assets\nOur contract assets primarily consist of revenue recognized under contracts containing MVC features whereby management has concluded it is probable there will be a short-fall payment at the end of the current MVC period, which typically follows the calendar year, and that a significant reversal of revenue recognized currently for the future MVC payment will not occur. As a result, our contract assets related to our future MVC payments are generally expected to be collected within the next 12 months and are included within\nOther current assets and deferred charges\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet until such time as the MVC short-fall payments are invoiced to the customer.\nContract Liabilities\nOur contract liabilities consist of advance payments primarily from midstream business customers which include construction reimbursements, prepayments, and other billings and transactions for which future services are to be provided under the contract. These amounts are deferred until recognized in revenue when the\n84\nassociated performance obligation has been satisfied, which is primarily based on a units of production methodology over the remaining contractual service periods, and are classified as current or noncurrent according to when such amounts are expected to be recognized. Current and noncurrent contract liabilities are included within\nAccrued liabilities\nand\nRegulatory liabilities, deferred income, and other\n, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nContracts requiring advance payments and the recognition of contract liabilities are evaluated to determine whether the advance payments provide us with a significant financing benefit. This determination is based on the combined effect of the expected length of time between when we transfer the promised good or service to the customer, when the customer pays for those goods or services, and the prevailing interest rates. We have assessed our contracts for significant financing components and determined, in our judgment, that one group of contracts entered into in contemplation of one another for certain capital reimbursements contains a significant financing component. As a result, we recognize noncash interest expense based on the effective interest method and revenue (noncash) is recognized when the underlying asset is placed into service utilizing a units of production or straight-line methodology over the life of the corresponding customer contract.\nLeases\nWe recognize a lease liability with an offsetting right-of-use asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for operating leases based on the present value of the future lease payments. We have elected to combine lease and nonlease components for all classes of leased assets in our calculation of the lease liability and the offsetting right-of-use asset.\nOur lease agreements require both fixed and variable periodic payments, with initial terms typically ranging from\none year\nto\n20\nyears, but a certain land lease has a term of\n108\nyears. Payment provisions in certain of our lease agreements contain escalation factors which may be based on stated rates or a change in a published index at a future time. The amount by which a lease escalates based on the change in a published index, which is not known at lease commencement, is considered a variable payment and is not included in the present value of the future lease payments, which only includes those that are stated or can be calculated based on the lease agreement at lease commencement. In addition to the noncancellable periods, many of our lease agreements provide for one or more extensions of the lease agreement for periods ranging from one year in length to an indefinite number of times following the specified contract term. Other lease agreements provide for extension terms that allow us to utilize the identified leased asset for an indefinite period of time so long as the asset continues to be utilized in our operations. In consideration of these renewal features, we assess the term of the lease agreements, which includes using judgment in the determination of which renewal periods and termination provisions, when at our sole election, will be reasonably certain of being exercised. Periods after the initial term or extension terms that allow for either party to the lease to cancel the lease are not considered in the assessment of the lease term. Additionally, we have elected to exclude leases with an original term of one year or less, including renewal periods, from the calculation of the lease liability and the offsetting right-of-use asset.\nWe use judgment in determining the discount rate upon which the present value of the future lease payments is determined. This rate is based on a collateralized interest rate corresponding to the term of the lease agreement using company, industry, and market information available.\nWhen permitted under our lease agreements, we may sublease certain unused office space for fixed periods that could extend up to the length of the original lease agreement.\nInterest capitalized\nWe capitalize interest during construction on major projects with construction periods of at least\n3\nmonths and a total project cost in excess of $\n1\nmillion. Interest is capitalized on borrowed funds and, where regulation by the FERC exists, on internally generated funds (equity AFUDC). The latter is included in\nOther income (expense) – net\nbelow\nOperating income (loss)\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The rates used by regulated companies\n85\nare calculated in accordance with FERC rules. Rates used by nonregulated companies are based on our average interest rate on debt.\nEmployee stock-based awards\nWe recognize compensation expense on employee stock-based awards on a straight-line basis; forfeitures are recognized when they occur.\nPension and other postretirement benefits\nThe funded status of each of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is recognized separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either an asset or liability. The funded status is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the plan’s benefit obligation. The plans’ benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs (credits) are actuarially determined and impacted by various assumptions and estimates.\nThe discount rates are determined separately for each of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on an approach specific to our plans. The year-end discount rates are determined considering a yield curve comprised of high-quality corporate bonds and the timing of the expected benefit cash flows of each plan.\nThe expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are determined by combining a review of the historical returns within the portfolio, the investment strategy included in the plans’ investment policy statement, and capital market projections for the asset classes in which the portfolio is invested, as well as the weighting of each asset class.\nUnrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized prior service costs and credits are deferred and recorded in AOCI or, for Transco and Northwest Pipeline, as a regulatory asset or liability, until amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost (credit). Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses in excess of\n10\npercent of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets are amortized over the participants’ average remaining future years of service, which is approximately\n10\nyears for our pension plans and approximately\n6\nyears for our other postretirement benefit plan.\nThe expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost (credit) is calculated using the market-related value of plan assets. For our pension plans, the market-related value of plan assets is equal to the fair value of plan assets adjusted to reflect the amortization of gains or losses associated with the difference between the expected and actual return on plan assets over a\n5\n-year period. Additionally, the market-related value of assets may be no more than\n110\npercent or less than\n90\npercent of the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year. The market-related value of plan assets for our other postretirement benefit plan is equal to the unadjusted fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year.\nIncome taxes\nWe include the operations\nof our\ndomestic\ncorporate\nsubsidiaries and income\nfrom our subsidiary\npartnerships in\nour consolidated\nfed\ne\nral income tax return\nand also file\ntax return\ns\nin\nvarious\nforeign and\nstate\njurisdictions as required\n.\nDeferred income taxes are\ncomputed\nusing the liability\nmethod\nand are provided\non all\ntemporary differences between the\nfinancial\nbasis and the tax basis\nof our assets\nand\nliabilities. Our\njudgment\nand income\ntax\nassumptions\nare used\nto\ndetermine the\nlevels, if\nany, of\nv\naluation\nallowances associated with\ndeferred tax assets.\nEarnings (loss) per common share\nBasic earnings (loss) per common share\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations is based on the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and vested restricted stock units.\nDiluted earnings (loss) per common share\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations includes any dilutive effect of nonvested restricted stock units, stock options, and convertible instruments, unless otherwise noted.\nDiluted earnings (loss) per common share\nis calculated using the treasury-stock method.\n86\nAccounting standards issued and adopted\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13 “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 changed the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and other instruments, entities are required to use a forward-looking “expected loss” model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. We adopted ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2020, which primarily applied to our short-term trade receivables. There was no cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption.\nThe majority of our trade receivable balances are due within 30 days. We monitor the credit quality of our counterparties through review of collection trends, credit ratings, and other analyses, such as bankruptcy monitoring. Financial assets from our natural gas transmission business and gathering and transportation business are segregated into separate pools for evaluation due to different counterparty risks inherent in each business. Changes in counterparty risk factors could lead to reassessment of the composition of our financial assets as separate pools or the need for additional pools. We calculate our allowance for credit losses incorporating an aging method. In estimating our expected credit losses, we utilized historical loss rates over many years, which included periods of both high and low commodity prices. Commodity prices could have a significant impact on a portion of our gathering and processing counterparties’ financial health and ability to satisfy current liabilities. Our expected credit loss estimate considered both internal and external forward-looking commodity price expectations, as well as counterparty credit ratings, and factors impacting their near-term liquidity. In addition, our expected credit loss estimate considered potential contractual, physical, and commercial protections and outcomes in the case of a counterparty bankruptcy. The physical location and nature of our services help to mitigate collectability concerns of our gathering and processing producer customers. Our gathering lines in many cases are physically connected to the customers’ wellheads and pads, and there may not be alternative gathering lines nearby. The construction of gathering systems is capital intensive and it would be costly for others to replicate, especially considering the depletion to date of the associated reserves. As a result, we play a critical role in getting customers’ production from the wellhead to a marketable condition and location. This tends to reduce collectability risk as our services enable producers to generate operating cash flows. Commodity price movements generally do not impact the majority of our natural gas transmission businesses customers’ financial condition.\nPast due accounts are generally written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts only after all collection attempts have been exhausted. We do not have a material amount of significantly aged receivables at December 31, 2020.\nNote 2 – Variable Interest Entities\nConsolidated VIEs\nAs of December 31, 2020, we consolidate the following VIEs:\nNortheast JV\nWe own a\n65\npercent interest in the Northeast JV, a subsidiary that is a VIE due to certain of our voting rights being disproportionate to our obligation to absorb losses and substantially all of the Northeast JV’s activities being performed on our behalf. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the Northeast JV’s economic performance. The Northeast JV provides midstream services for producers in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale regions. Future expansion activity is expected to be funded with capital contributions from us and the other equity partner on a proportional basis.\nGulfstar One\nWe own a\n51\npercent interest in Gulfstar One, a subsidiary that, due to certain risk-sharing provisions in its customer contracts, is a VIE. Gulfstar One includes a proprietary floating-production system, Gulfstar FPS, and\n87\nassociated pipelines that provide production handling and gathering services in the eastern deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Gulfstar One’s economic performance.\nCardinal\nWe own a\n66\npercent interest in Cardinal, a subsidiary that provides gathering services for the Utica Shale region and is a VIE due to certain risks shared with customers. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Cardinal’s economic performance. Future expansion activity is expected to be funded with capital contributions from us and the other equity partner on a proportional basis.\nThe following table presents amounts included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that are only for the use or obligation of our consolidated VIEs:\nNonconsolidated VIEs\nTarga Train 7\nWe own a\n20\npercent interest in Targa Train 7, which provides fractionation services at Mt. Belvieu and is a VIE due primarily to our limited participating rights as the minority equity holder. At December 31, 2020, the carrying value of our investment in Targa Train 7 was $\n51\nmillion. Our maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment.\nBrazos Permian II\nWe own a\n15\npercent interest in Brazos Permian II (see Note 7 – Investing Activities), which provides gathering and processing services in the Delaware basin and is a VIE due primarily to our limited participating rights as the minority equity holder. During the first quarter of 2020 we recorded an impairment of our equity-method investment in Brazos Permian II (see Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk). Our maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment.\nNote 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures\nUEOM\nAs of December 31, 2018, we owned a\n62\npercent interest in Utica East Ohio Midstream LLC (UEOM) which we accounted for as an equity-method investment. On March 18, 2019, we signed and closed the acquisition of the\n88\nremaining\n38\npercent interest in UEOM. Total consideration paid, including post-closing adjustments, was $\n741\nmillion in cash funded through credit facility borrowings and cash on hand, net of $\n13\nmillion cash acquired. As a result of acquiring this additional interest, we obtained control of and consolidated UEOM.\nUEOM is involved primarily in the processing and fractionation of natural gas and natural gas liquids in the Utica Shale play in eastern Ohio. The purpose of the acquisition was to enhance our position in the region. We expect synergies through common ownership of UEOM and our Ohio Valley midstream systems to create a more efficient platform for capital spending in the region, resulting in reduced operating and maintenance expenses and creating enhanced capabilities and benefits for producers in the area.\nThe acquisition of UEOM was accounted for as a business combination, which requires, among other things, that identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their acquisition date fair values. In March 2019, based on the transaction price for our purchase of the remaining interest in UEOM as finalized just prior to the acquisition, we recognized a $\n74\nmillion noncash impairment loss related to our existing\n62\npercent interest (see Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk). Thus, there was\nno\ngain or loss on remeasuring our existing equity-method investment to fair value due to the impairment recognized just prior to closing the acquisition of the additional interest.\nThe valuation techniques used to measure the acquisition date fair value of the UEOM acquisition consisted of the market approach for our previous equity-method investment in UEOM and the income approach (excess earnings method) for valuation of intangible assets and depreciated replacement costs for property, plant, and equipment.\nThe following table presents the allocation of the acquisition date fair value of the major classes of the assets acquired, which are presented in the Northeast G&P segment, and liabilities assumed, including post closing purchase price adjustments. The net assets acquired reflect the sum of the consideration transferred and the noncash elimination of the fair value of our existing equity-method investment upon our acquisition of the additional interest. The fair value of accounts receivable acquired, presented in current assets in the table, equals contractual amounts receivable.\nThe goodwill recognized in the acquisition related primarily to enhancing and diversifying our basin positions and is reported within the Northeast G&P segment.  Substantially all of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.  As of December 31, 2019, goodwill was included within\nIntangible assets – net of accumulated amortization\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet and represented the excess of the consideration, plus the fair value of any previously held equity interest, over the fair value of the net assets acquired.\nThe goodwill recognized in the UEOM acquisition of $\n187\nmillion, which includes a $\n1\nmillion adjustment recorded in the first quarter of 2020, was impaired during first quarter of 2020.  Our partner’s $\n65\nmillion share of\n89\nthis impairment is reflected within\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations (see Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk).\nOther intangible assets recognized in the acquisition are related to contractual customer relationships from gas gathering, processing, and fractionation agreements with our customers. The basis for determining the value of these intangible assets is estimated future net cash flows to be derived from acquired contractual customer relationships discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. These intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of\n20\nyears which represents the term over which the contractual customer relationships are expected to contribute to our cash flows. Approximately\n49\npercent of the expected future revenues from these contractual customer relationships are impacted by our ability and intent to renew or renegotiate existing customer contracts. We expense costs incurred to renew or extend the terms of our gas gathering, processing, and fractionation contracts with customers. Based on the estimated future revenues during the current contract periods (as estimated at the time of the acquisition), the weighted-average period prior to the next renewal or extension of the existing contractual customer relationships was approximately\n10\nyears.\nThe following unaudited pro forma\nRevenues\nand\nNet income (loss) attributable to The Williams Companies, Inc.\nfor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are presented as if the UEOM acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2018. These pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of what the actual results would have been if the acquisition had in fact occurred on the date or for the periods indicated, nor do they purport to project\nRevenues\nor\nNet income (loss) attributable to The Williams Companies, Inc.\nfor any future periods or as of any date. These amounts do not give effect to any potential cost savings, operating synergies, or revenue enhancements to result from the transaction or the potential costs to achieve these cost savings, operating synergies, and revenue enhancements.\nAdjustments to pro forma\nNet income (loss) attributable to The Williams Companies, Inc.\ninclude the removal of the previously described $\n74\nmillion impairment loss recognized in March 2019 just prior to the acquisition.\nDuring the period from the acquisition date of March 18, 2019 to December 31, 2019, UEOM contributed\nRevenues\nof $\n179\nmillion and\nNet income (loss) attributable to The Williams Companies, Inc.\nof $\n53\nmillion.\nCosts related to this acquisition are $\n4\nmillion and are reported within our Northeast G&P segment and included in\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNortheast JV\nConcurrent with the UEOM acquisition, we executed an agreement whereby we contributed our consolidated interests in UEOM and our Ohio Valley midstream business to a newly formed partnership. In June 2019, our partner invested approximately $\n1.33\nbillion for a\n35\npercent ownership interest, and we retained\n65\npercent ownership of, as well as operate and consolidate, the Northeast JV business. The change in ownership due to this transaction increased\nNoncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries\nby $\n567\nmillion, and decreased\nCapital in excess of par value\nby $\n426\nmillion and\nDeferred income tax liabilities\nby $\n141\nmillion in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019. Costs related to this transaction are $\n6\nmillion and are reported within our Northeast G&P segment and included in\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n90\nSale of Gulf Coast Pipeline Systems\nIn November 2018, we completed the sale of certain assets and operations located in the Gulf Coast area for $\n177\nmillion in cash. As a result of this sale, we recorded a gain of approximately $\n101\nmillion in the fourth quarter of 2018, consisting of $\n81\nmillion in our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico segment and $\n20\nmillion in Other.\nPrevious impairments made to a portion of these assets and operations include $\n66\nmillion related to certain idle pipelines in the second quarter of 2018. The impairment is reflected in\nImpairment of certain assets\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations. (See Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk.) The results of operations for this disposal group, excluding the impairments and gains noted, were not significant for the reporting period.\nSale of Four Corners Assets\nIn October 2018, we completed the sale of our natural gas gathering and processing assets in the Four Corners area of New Mexico and Colorado for total consideration of $\n1.125\nbillion. As a result of this sale, we recorded a gain of approximately $\n591\nmillion within the West segment in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe following table presents the results of operations for the Four Corners area, excluding the gain noted above:\nNote 4 – Related Party Transactions\nTransactions with Equity-Method Investees\nWe have purchases from our equity-method investees included in\nProduct costs\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations of $\n348\nmillion, $\n304\nmillion, and $\n236\nmillion for the years ended 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We have $\n50\nmillion and $\n36\nmillion included in\nAccounts payable\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet with our equity-method investees at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe have operating agreements with certain equity-method investees. These operating agreements typically provide for reimbursement or payment to us for certain direct operational payroll and employee benefit costs, materials, supplies, and other charges and also for management services. The total charges to equity-method investees for these fees are $\n79\nmillion, $\n103\nmillion, and $\n75\nmillion for the years ended 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n91\nNote 5 – Revenue Recognition\nRevenue by Category\nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregated by major service line:\n92\n______________________________\n(1)\nRevenues not within the scope of ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” consist of leasing revenues associated with our headquarters building and management fees that we receive for certain services we provide to operated equity-method investments, which are reported in\nService revenues\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations, and amounts associated with our derivative contracts, which are reported in\nProduct sales\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations\n.\nContract Assets\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our contract assets:\n93\nContract Liabilities\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our contract liabilities:\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations primarily include reservation charges on contracted capacity for our gas pipeline firm transportation contracts with customers, storage capacity contracts, long-term contracts containing minimum volume commitments associated with our midstream businesses, and fixed payments associated with offshore production handling. For our interstate natural gas pipeline businesses, remaining performance obligations reflect the rates for such services in our current FERC tariffs for the life of the related contracts; however, these rates may change based on future tariffs approved by the FERC and the amount and timing of these changes are not currently known.\nOur remaining performance obligations exclude variable consideration, including contracts with variable consideration for which we have elected the practical expedient for consideration recognized in revenue as billed. Certain of our contracts contain evergreen and other renewal provisions for periods beyond the initial term of the contract. The remaining performance obligation amounts as of December 31, 2020, do not consider potential future performance obligations for which the renewal has not been exercised and exclude contracts with customers for which the underlying facilities have not received FERC authorization to be placed into service. Consideration received prior to December 31, 2020, that will be recognized in future periods is also excluded from our remaining performance obligations and is instead reflected in contract liabilities.\nThe following table presents the amount of the contract liabilities balance expected to be recognized as revenue when performance obligations are satisfied and the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations under certain contracts as of December 31, 2020.\n94\nNote 6 – Other Income and Expenses\nThe following table presents by segment, certain items within\nOperating and maintenance expenses\nand\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations:\nAdditional Items\nOther income (expense) – net\nbelow\nOperating income (loss)\nincludes $\n15\nmillion, $\n32\nmillion, and $\n89\nmillion of income for equity AFUDC within the Transmission & Gulf of Mexico segment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nOther income (expense) – net\nbelow\nOperating income (loss)\nalso includes $(\n13\n) million of loss and $\n9\nmillion and $\n35\nmillion of income, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, associated with regulatory assets related to the effects of deferred taxes on equity funds used during construction primarily within the Other segment.\nNote 7 – Investing Activities\nAcquisition of Additional Interests in Caiman II\nAs of December 31, 2019, we effectively owned a\n29\npercent indirect interest in Blue Racer through our\n58\npercent interest in Caiman II, whose primary asset is a\n50\npercent interest in Blue Racer. On November 18, 2020, we paid $\n157\nmillion, net of cash acquired, to acquire an additional\n41\npercent ownership interest in Caiman II. We now control and consolidate Caiman II, reporting the\n50\npercent interest in Blue Racer as an equity-method investment. Since substantially all of the fair value of the Caiman II assets acquired is concentrated in a single asset, the investment in Blue Racer, and we previously held a noncontrolling interest in Caiman II, we recorded the November 18, 2020, additional purchase of interests as an asset acquisition.\nEquity Earnings (Losses)\nEquity earnings (losses)\nin 2020 includes a $\n78\nmillion loss associated with the first-quarter full impairment of goodwill recognized by our investee RMM, which was allocated entirely to our member interest per the terms of the membership agreement. Also included in 2020 are losses of $\n11\nmillion, $\n26\nmillion, and $\n10\nmillion for our share of asset impairments at Laurel Mountain, Appalachia Midstream Investments, and Blue Racer, respectively.\nImpairments of Equity-Method Investments\nSee Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk for information regarding impairments of our equity-method investments of $\n1,046\nmillion, $\n186\nmillion, and $\n32\nmillion for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\n95\nOther Investing Income (Loss) – Net\nThe following table presents certain items reflected in\nOther investing income (loss) – net\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations:\nConstitution deconsolidation\nUpon determination that we were no longer the primary beneficiary, we deconsolidated our interest in Constitution Pipeline Company, LLC (Constitution) as of December 31, 2019, recognizing a loss on deconsolidation of $\n27\nmillion.\nDelaware basin asset deconsolidation and Brazos Permian II equity-method investment\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we contributed the majority of our existing Delaware basin assets and $\n27\nmillion in cash in exchange for a\n15\npercent interest in the Brazos Permian II, which consists of gas and crude oil gathering pipelines, natural gas processing, and oil storage facilities. We recorded a deconsolidation gain of $\n141\nmillion reflecting the excess of the fair value of our acquired interest over the carrying value of the assets contributed. We estimated the fair value of our interest to be $\n192\nmillion primarily using a market approach (a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy). This approach involved the observation of recent transaction multiples in the Permian basin, including recent acquisitions consummated during 2018. Our interest in Brazos Permian II is considered an equity-method investment due to the fact that we are able to exert significant influence over its operating and financial policies.\nJackalope deconsolidation\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, we deconsolidated our\n50\npercent interest in Jackalope Gas Gathering Services, L.L.C. (Jackalope). We recorded our interest in Jackalope as an equity-method investment at its estimated fair value, resulting in a deconsolidation gain of $\n62\nmillion. We estimated the fair value of our interest to be $\n310\nmillion using an income approach based on expected future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate (a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy). The determination of expected future cash flows involved significant assumptions regarding gathering and processing volumes and related capital spending. A\n10.9\npercent discount rate was utilized and reflected our estimate of the cost of capital as impacted by market conditions and risks associated with the underlying business. The deconsolidated carrying value of the net assets of Jackalope included $\n47\nmillion of goodwill.\nGain on disposition of Jackalope\nIn April 2019, we sold our\n50\npercent equity-method interest in Jackalope for $\n485\nmillion in cash, resulting in a gain on the disposition of $\n122\nmillion.\n96\nEquity-Method Investments\n___________\n(1)\nIncludes equity-method investments in multiple gathering systems in the Marcellus Shale with an approximate average\n66\npercent interest.\n(2)\nSee previous discussion in the section\nAcquisition of Additional Interests in Caiman II\nabove.\nThe carrying value of our Appalachia Midstream Investments exceeds our portion of the underlying net assets by approximately $\n1.2\nbillion and $\n1.4\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These differences were assigned at the acquisition date to property, plant, and equipment and customer relationship intangible assets. Certain of our other equity-method investments have a carrying value less than our portion of the underlying net assets primarily due to other than temporary impairments that we have recognized but that were not required to be recognized in the investees’ financial statements. These differences total approximately $\n1.3\nbillion and $\n360\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were assigned to property, plant, and equipment and customer relationship intangible assets. Differences in the carrying value of our equity-method investments and our portion of the underlying net assets are generally amortized over the remaining useful lives of the associated underlying assets and included in\nEquity earnings (losses)\nwithin the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nPurchases of and contributions to equity-method investments\nWe generally fund our portion of significant expansion or development projects of these investees through additional capital contributions. These transactions increased the carrying value of our investments and included:\n___________\n(1)\nSee previous discussion in the section\nAcquisition of Additional Interests in Caiman II\nabove.\n97\nDividends and distributions\nThe organizational documents of entities in which we have an equity-method investment generally require distribution of available cash to members on at least a quarterly basis. These transactions reduced the carrying value of our investments and included:\n___________\n(1)\nSee previous discussion in\nthe section\nAcquisition of Additional Interests in Caiman II\nabove.\nSummarized Financial Position and Results of Operations of All Equity-Method Investments\n98\nNote 8 – Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nThe\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\nincludes:\nReconciliations from the\nProvision (benefit) at statutory rate\nto recorded\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\nare as follows:\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes\nincludes $\n1\nmillion, $\n6\nmillion, and $\n3\nmillion of foreign loss in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nDuring the course of audits of our business by domestic and foreign tax authorities, we frequently face challenges regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the liability associated with our various filing positions, we apply the two-step process of recognition and measurement. In association with this liability, we record an estimate of related interest and tax exposure as a component of our tax provision. The impact of this accrual is included within\nOther – net\nin our reconciliation of the\nProvision (benefit) at statutory rate\nto recorded\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n.\n99\nSignificant components of\nDeferred income tax liabilities\nand\nDeferred income tax assets\nare as follows:\nThe valuation allowance at December 31, 2020 and 2019 serves to reduce the available deferred income tax assets to an amount that will, more likely than not, be realized. We considered all available positive and negative evidence, which incorporates available tax planning strategies, and management’s estimate of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, and have determined that a portion of our deferred income tax assets related to the\nForeign tax credit\nand\nState losses and credits\nmay not be realized. The amounts presented in the table above are, with respect to state items, before any federal benefit. The change from prior year for the\nState losses and credits\nreflects increases in losses and credits generated in the current and prior years less losses and/or credits utilized in the current year. We have loss and credit carryovers in multiple state taxing jurisdictions. These attributes generally expire between 2021 and 2039 with some carryovers having indefinite carryforward periods.\nFederal loss carryovers\ninclude deferred tax assets on loss carryovers of $\n905\nmillion which have no expiration date.\nCash refunds for income taxes (net of payments) were $\n40\nmillion and $\n86\nmillion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash payments for income taxes (net of refunds) were $\n11\nmillion in 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $\n51\nmillion of unrecognized tax benefits.\nNo\nchange occurred to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in each of the years 2020 and 2019. If recognized, income tax expense would be reduced by $\n51\nmillion for each of the years 2020 and 2019, including the effect of these changes on other tax attributes, with state income tax amounts included net of federal tax effect.\nWe recognize related interest and penalties as a component of\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n. Total interest and penalties recognized as part of income tax provision were a benefit of $\n900\nthousand in 2020 and expenses of $\n500\nthousand and $\n800\nthousand for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Approximately $\n4\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion of interest and penalties primarily relating to uncertain tax positions have been accrued as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDuring the next 12 months, we do not expect ultimate resolution of any unrecognized tax benefit associated with domestic or international matters to have a material impact on our unrecognized tax benefit position.\n100\nConsolidated U.S. Federal income tax returns are open to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination for years after 2010, excluding 2015 and 2016, for which the statutes have expired. As of December 31, 2020, examinations of tax returns for 2011 through 2014 are currently in appeals. We do not expect material changes in our financial position resulting from these examinations. The statute of limitations for most states expires one year after expiration of the IRS statute. Generally, tax returns for our previously owned Canadian entities are open to audit for tax years after 2012. Tax years 2013 and 2014 are currently under income tax examination. In September 2016, we sold the majority of our Canadian operations and, as part of the sale, indemnified the purchaser for any increases in Canadian tax due to an audit of any tax periods prior to the sale.\nNote 9 – Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share from Continuing Operations\n________________\n(1)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018,\n2.0\nmillion weighted-average nonvested restricted stock units and\n0.5\nmillion weighted-average stock options have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings (loss) per common share as their inclusion would be antidilutive due to our loss from continuing operations attributable to The Williams Companies, Inc.\nNote 10 – Employee Benefit Plans\nPension Plans\nWe have noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2019. Eligible employees earn compensation credits based on a cash balance formula. As of January 1, 2020, certain active employees are no longer eligible to receive compensation credits. At the time of retirement, participants may elect, to the extent they are eligible for the various options, to receive annuity payments, a lump-sum payment, or a combination of annuity and lump-sum payments.\nWe recognized a pre-tax, noncash settlement charge of $\n23\nmillion in 2018, which is substantially reported in\nOther income (expense) – net\nbelow\nOperating income (loss)\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations. This amount is included within the subsequent tables of net periodic benefit cost (credit) and other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) before taxes.\nOther Postretirement Benefits\nWe currently provide subsidized retiree medical and life insurance benefits to certain eligible participants. Generally, employees hired after December 31, 1991, are not eligible for the subsidized retiree medical benefits, except for participants that were employees or retirees of Transco Energy Company on December 31, 1995. Subsidized retiree medical benefits for eligible participants age 65 and older are paid through contributions to health reimbursement accounts. Subsidized retiree medical benefits for eligible participants under age 65 are provided through a self-insured medical plan sponsored by us. The self-insured retiree medical plan provides for retiree\n101\ncontributions and contains other cost-sharing features such as deductibles, co-payments, and co-insurance. The accounting for this plan anticipates estimated future increases to our contribution levels to the health reimbursement accounts for participants age 65 and older, as well as future cost-sharing that is consistent with our expressed intent to increase the retiree contribution level generally in line with health care cost increases for participants under age 65.\nDefined Contribution Plan\nWe have a defined contribution plan for the benefit of substantially all employees. Plan participants may contribute a portion of their compensation on a pre-tax or after-tax basis. Generally, we match employee contributions up to\n6\npercent of eligible compensation. Additionally, eligible active employees that are not eligible to receive compensation credits under the defined benefit pension plan are eligible for a fixed annual contribution made by us to the defined contribution plan. Our contributions charged to expense were $\n42\nmillion in 2020, $\n36\nmillion in 2019, and $\n35\nmillion in 2018.\nFunded Status\nThe following table presents the changes in benefit obligations and plan assets for pension benefits and other postretirement benefits for the years indicated:\n102\nThe overfunded (underfunded) status of our pension plans and other postretirement benefit plan presented in the previous table are recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet within the following accounts:\nThe plan assets within our other postretirement benefit plan are intended to be used for the payment of benefits for certain groups of participants. The\nCurrent liabilities\nfor the other postretirement benefit plan represent the current portion of benefits expected to be payable in the subsequent year for the groups of participants whose benefits are not expected to be paid from plan assets.\nThe pension plans’ benefit obligation\nNet actuarial loss (gain)\nof $\n47\nmillion in 2020 and $\n69\nmillion in 2019 are primarily due to the impact of decreases in the discount rates utilized to calculate the benefit obligation, partially offset by the impact of decreases in the cash balance interest crediting rate assumption.\nThe 2020 benefit obligation\nNet actuarial loss (gain)\nof $\n9\nmillion for our other postretirement benefit plan is primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligation, partially offset by the net impact of experience related items. The 2019 benefit obligation\nNet actuarial loss (gain)\nof $\n30\nmillion for our other postretirement benefit plan is primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligation and other assumption changes, partially offset by the impact of benefit payment experience and tax law changes.\nThe following table summarizes information for pension plans with obligations in excess of plan assets.\n103\nPre-tax amounts not yet recognized in\nNet periodic benefit cost (credit)\nat December 31 are as follows:\nIn addition to the regulatory liabilities included in the previous table, differences in the amount of actuarially determined\nNet periodic benefit cost (credit)\nfor our other postretirement benefit plan and the other postretirement benefit costs recovered in rates for Transco and Northwest Pipeline are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability. We have regulatory liabilities of $\n100\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and $\n106\nmillion at December 31, 2019, related to these deferrals. Additionally, Transco recognizes a regulatory liability for rate collections in excess of its amount funded to the tax-qualified pension plans. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, these regulatory liabilities were $\n39\nmillion and $\n43\nmillion, respectively. These pension and other postretirement plans amounts will be reflected in rates based on the rate structures of these gas pipelines.\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost (Credit)\nNet periodic benefit cost (credit)\nfor the years ended December 31 consist of the following:\nThe components of\nNet periodic benefit cost (credit)\nother than the\nservice cost\ncomponent are included in\nOther income (expense) – net\nbelow\nOperating income (loss)\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n104\nItems Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\nbefore taxes for the years ended December 31 consist of the following:\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations for our other postretirement benefit plan associated with Transco and Northwest Pipeline are recognized in regulatory assets and liabilities.\nAmounts recognized in regulatory assets and liabilities for the years ended December 31 consist of the following:\nKey Assumptions\nThe weighted-average assumptions utilized to determine benefit obligations as of December 31 are as follows:\nThe weighted-average assumptions utilized to determine\nNet periodic benefit cost (credit)\nfor the years ended December 31 are as follows:\n105\nThe mortality assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect generational projection mortality tables.\nThe assumed health care cost trend rate for 2021 is\n7.0\npercent. This rate\ndecreases\nto\n4.5\npercent by\n2027\n.\nPlan Assets\nPlan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities including mutual funds and commingled investment funds invested in equity and fixed income securities. The plans’ investment policy provides for a strategy in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which governs the investment of the assets in a diversified portfolio. The plans follow a policy of diversifying the investments across various asset classes and investment managers.\nThe investment policy for the pension plans includes a general target asset allocation at December 31, 2020, of\n25\npercent equity securities and\n75\npercent fixed income securities. The target allocation includes the investments in equity and fixed income mutual and commingled investment funds.\nEquity securities may include U.S. equities and non-U.S. equities. Investment in Williams’ securities or an entity in which Williams has a majority ownership is prohibited except where these securities may be owned in a commingled investment fund in which the plans’ trusts invest. No more than\n5\npercent of the total stock portfolio valued at market may be invested in the common stock of any one corporation.\nFixed income securities may consist of U.S. as well as international instruments, including emerging markets.  The fixed income strategies may invest in U.S. and sovereign government, corporate, asset-backed securities, and mortgage-backed obligations. The weighted-average credit rating of the fixed income strategies must be at least “investment grade” including ratings by Moody’s and/or Standard & Poor’s. No more than\n5\npercent of the total fixed income portfolio may be invested in the fixed income securities of any one issuer with the exception of bond index funds and U.S. government guaranteed and agency securities.\nThe following securities and transactions are not authorized: unregistered securities, commodities or commodity contracts, short sales or margin transactions, or other leveraging strategies. Additionally, real estate equity, natural resource property, venture capital, leveraged buyouts, and other high-return, high-risk investments are generally restricted. Use of derivative securities in mutual funds and commingled investment funds held by the plans’ trusts is allowed. However, direct investment in derivative securities requires approval. Currently, investment managers are approved to enter into U.S. Treasury futures contracts on behalf of the plans to implement and manage duration and yield curve strategy in the fixed income portfolio.\nThere are no significant concentrations of risk within the plans’ investment securities because of the diversity of the types of investments, diversity of the various industries, and the diversity of the fund managers and investment strategies. Generally, the investments held in the plans are publicly traded, therefore, minimizing liquidity risk in the portfolio.\n106\nThe fair values of our pension plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 by asset class are as follows:\n107\n108\nThe fair values of our other postretirement benefits plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 by asset class are as follows:\n109\n____________\n(1)\nThe weighted-average credit quality rating of the fixed income security portfolio is investment grade with a weighted-average duration of approximately\n16\nyears for 2020 and\n14\nyears for 2019.\n(2)    The stated intents of the funds vary based on each commingled fund’s investment objective. These objectives generally include strategies to replicate or outperform various market indices. Certain standard withdrawal restrictions generally apply, which may include redemption notification period restrictions ranging from\n1\nday to\n30\ndays. Additionally, the fund managers retain the right to restrict withdrawals from and/or purchases into the funds so as not to disadvantage other investors in the funds. Generally, the funds also reserve the right to make all or a portion of the redemption in-kind rather than in cash or a combination of cash and in-kind.\nThe fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement of an asset.\nShares of the cash management and mutual funds are valued at fair value based on published market prices as of the close of business on the last business day of the year, which represents the net asset values of the shares held.\nThe fair values of equity securities traded on U.S. exchanges are derived from quoted market prices as of the close of business on the last business day of the year. The fair values of equity securities traded on foreign exchanges are also derived from quoted market prices as of the close of business on an active foreign exchange on the last business day of the year. However, the valuation requires translation of the foreign currency to U.S. dollars and this translation is considered an observable input to the valuation.\nThe fair values of all commingled investment funds are determined based on the net asset values per unit of each of the funds. The net asset values per unit represent the aggregate values of the funds’ assets at fair value less liabilities, divided by the number of units outstanding.\n110\nThe fair values of fixed income securities, except U.S. Treasury securities, are determined using pricing models. These pricing models incorporate observable inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, and issuer spreads for similar securities to determine fair value. The U.S. Treasury securities are valued at fair value based on closing prices on the last business day of the year reported in the active market in which the security is traded.\nPlan Benefit Payments and Employer Contributions\nFollowing are the expected benefits to be paid by the plans. These estimates are based on the same assumptions previously discussed and reflect future service as appropriate. The actuarial assumptions are based on long-term expectations and include, but are not limited to, assumptions as to average expected retirement age and form of benefit payment. Actual benefit payments could differ significantly from expected benefit payments if near-term participant behaviors differ significantly from the actuarial assumptions.\nIn 2021, we do not expect to contribute to our tax-qualified pension plans. We expect to contribute approximately $\n2\nmillion to our nonqualified pension plans and approximately $\n6\nmillion to our other postretirement benefit plan.\nNote 11 – Property, Plant, and Equipment\nThe following table presents nonregulated and regulated\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\nas presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the years ended:\n__________\n(1)    Estimated useful life and depreciation rates are presented as of December 31, 2020. Depreciation rates and estimated useful lives for regulated assets are prescribed by the FERC.\n111\nDepreciation and amortization expense for\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\nwas $\n1.393\nbillion, $\n1.390\nbillion, and $\n1.392\nbillion in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nRegulated\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\nincludes approximately $\n507\nmillion and $\n547\nmillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to amounts in excess of the original cost of the regulated facilities within our gas pipeline businesses as a result of our prior acquisitions. This amount is being amortized over\n40\nyears using the straight-line amortization method. Current FERC policy does not permit recovery through rates for amounts in excess of original cost of construction.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOur accrued obligations primarily relate to offshore platforms and pipelines, gas transmission pipelines and facilities, gas processing, fractionation, and compression facilities, gas gathering well connections and pipelines, underground storage caverns, and producing wells. At the end of the useful life of each respective asset, we are legally obligated to dismantle offshore platforms and appropriately abandon offshore pipelines, to remove certain components of gas transmission facilities from the ground, to restore land and remove surface equipment at gas processing, fractionation, and compression facilities, to cap certain gathering pipelines at the wellhead connection and remove any related surface equipment, to plug storage caverns and remove any related surface equipment, and to plug producing wells and remove any related surface equipment.\nThe following table presents the significant changes to our ARO, of which $\n1.159\nbillion and $\n1.117\nbillion are included in\nRegulatory liabilities, deferred income, and other\nwith the remaining current portion in\nAccrued liabilities\nat December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n___________\n(1)\nAs a result of the global resolution with Chesapeake in 2020, we recorded $\n31\nmillion of ARO related to natural gas properties transferred to us. (See Note 1 – General, Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.)\n(2)\nSeveral factors are considered in the annual review process, including inflation rates, current estimates for removal cost, market risk premiums, discount rates, and the estimated remaining useful life of the assets. The 2020 revisions reflect changes in removal cost estimates, increases in the estimated remaining useful life of certain assets, decreases in inflation rates, and decreases in the discount rates used in the annual review process. The 2019 revisions reflect changes in removal cost estimates, decreases in the estimated remaining useful life of certain assets, increases in inflation rates, and decreases in the discount rates used in the annual review process.\nThe funds Transco collects through a portion of its rates to fund its ARO are deposited into an external trust account dedicated to funding its ARO (ARO Trust). (See Note 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk.) Under its current rate settlement, Transco’s annual funding obligation is approximately $\n16\nmillion, with installments to be deposited monthly.\n112\nNote 12 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill, included in\nIntangible assets – net of accumulated amortization\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet, by reportable segment for the periods indicated are as follows:\nGoodwill is not subject to amortization, but is evaluated at least annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We did not identify or recognize any impairments to goodwill in connection with our evaluation of goodwill for impairment during the years ended December 31, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nOther Intangible Assets\nThe gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of other intangible assets, included in\nIntangible assets – net of accumulated amortization\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet, at December 31 are as follows:\nOther intangible assets primarily relate to gas gathering, processing, and fractionation contractual customer relationships recognized in acquisitions. Contractual customer relationships are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of\n20\nyears for the acquisition of UEOM and\n30\nyears for other acquisitions, which represents a portion of the term over which the contractual customer relationships are expected to contribute to our cash flows.\nWe expense costs incurred to renew or extend the terms of our gas gathering, processing, and fractionation contracts with customers. Based on the estimated future revenues during the contract periods (as estimated at the time of the acquisition), the weighted-average period prior to the next renewal or extension of the contractual customer relationships associated with the UEOM acquisition was approximately\n10\nyears. Although a significant portion of the expected future cash flows associated with these contractual customer relationships are dependent on our ability to renew or extend the arrangements beyond the initial contract periods, these expected future cash flows are significantly influenced by the scope and pace of our producer customers’ drilling programs. Once producer customers’ wells are connected to our gathering infrastructure, their likelihood of switching to another provider before the wells are abandoned is reduced due to the significant capital investment required.\nThe amortization expense related to other intangible assets was $\n328\nmillion, $\n324\nmillion, and $\n333\nmillion in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The estimated amortization expense for each of the next five succeeding fiscal years is approximately $\n328\nmillion.\n113\nNote 13 – Accrued Liabilities\n114\nNote 14 – Debt and Banking Arrangements\nLong-Term Debt\n115\nCertain of our debt agreements contain covenants that restrict or limit, among other things, our ability to create liens supporting indebtedness, sell assets, and incur additional debt. Default of these agreements could also restrict our ability to make certain distributions or repurchase equity.\nThe following table presents aggregate minimum maturities of long-term debt and other financing obligations, excluding net unamortized debt premium (discount) and debt issuance costs, for each of the next five years:\nIssuances and retirements\nOn August 17, 2020, we retired $\n600\nmillion of\n4.125\npercent senior unsecured notes that were due November 15, 2020.\nOn May 14, 2020, we completed a public offering of $\n1\nbillion of\n3.5\npercent senior unsecured notes due 2030.\nOn May 8, 2020, Transco issued $\n700\nmillion of\n3.25\npercent senior unsecured notes due 2030 and $\n500\nmillion of\n3.95\npercent senior unsecured notes due 2050 to investors in a private debt placement. As part of the issuance, Transco entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the unsecured notes. Under the terms of the agreement, Transco was obligated to file and consummate a registration statement for an offer to exchange the notes for a new issue of substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, within 365 days from closing and to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the exchange offer. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Transco filed the registration statement and completed the exchange offer.\nWe retired $\n1.5\nbillion of\n5.25\npercent senior unsecured notes that matured on March 15, 2020.\nWe retired $\n14\nmillion of\n8.75\npercent senior unsecured notes that matured on January 15, 2020.\nWe retired $\n32\nmillion of\n7.625\npercent senior unsecured notes that matured on July 15, 2019.\nOther financing obligations\nDuring the construction of the Atlantic Sunrise and Dalton projects, Transco received funding from its partners for their proportionate share of construction costs. Amounts received were recorded within noncurrent liabilities and the costs associated with construction were capitalized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Upon placing these projects into service Transco began utilizing the partners’ undivided interest in the assets, including the associated pipeline capacity, and reclassified the funding previously received from its partners from noncurrent liabilities to debt. The obligations, which mature in 2038 and 2052, respectively, require monthly interest and principal payments and both bear an interest rate of approximately\n9\npercent.\n116\nCredit Facilities\n________________\n(1)    In managing our available liquidity, we do not expect a maximum outstanding amount in excess of the capacity of our credit facility inclusive of any outstanding amounts under our commercial paper program.\nRevolving credit facility\nIn 2018, we along with Transco and Northwest Pipeline, the lenders named therein, and an administrative agent entered into a credit agreement (Credit Agreement) with aggregate commitments available of $\n4.5\nbillion, with up to an additional $\n500\nmillion increase in aggregate commitments available under certain circumstances. The maturity date of the credit facility is August 10, 2023. However, the co-borrowers may request up to two extensions of the maturity date each for an additional one-year period to allow a maturity date as late as August 10, 2025, under certain circumstances. The Credit Agreement allows for swing line loans up to an aggregate of $\n200\nmillion, subject to available capacity under the credit facility, and letters of credit commitments of $\n1\nbillion. Transco and Northwest Pipeline are each able to borrow up to $\n500\nmillion under this credit facility to the extent not otherwise utilized by the other co-borrowers.\nThe Credit Agreement contains the following terms and conditions:\n•\nVarious covenants may limit, among other things, a borrower’s and its material subsidiaries’ ability to grant certain liens supporting indebtedness, merge or consolidate, sell all or substantially all of its assets, make certain distributions during an event of default, and enter into certain restrictive agreements.\n•\nIf an event of default with respect to a borrower occurs under the credit facility, the lenders will be able to terminate the commitments and accelerate the maturity of the loans and exercise other rights and remedies.\n•\nOther than swing line loans, each time funds are borrowed, the applicable borrower may choose from two methods of calculating interest: a fluctuating base rate equal to Citibank N.A.'s alternate base rate plus an applicable margin or a periodic fixed rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate plus an applicable margin. We are required to pay a commitment fee based on the unused portion of the credit facility. The applicable margin and the commitment fee are determined by reference to a pricing schedule based on the applicable borrower’s senior unsecured long-term debt ratings.\nSignificant financial covenants under the Credit Agreement require the ratio of debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), each as defined in the credit facility, to be no greater than\n5.0\nto 1, except for the fiscal quarter and the two following fiscal quarters in which one or more acquisitions with a total aggregate purchase price of $\n25\nmillion or more has been executed, in which case the ratio of debt to EBITDA is to be no greater than\n5.5\nto 1.\nThe ratio of debt to capitalization (defined as net worth plus debt) must be no greater than\n65\npercent for each of Transco and Northwest Pipeline.\nAt December 31, 2020, we are in compliance with these covenants.\nCommercial Paper Program\nIn 2018, we entered into a $\n4\nbillion commercial paper program. The maturities of the commercial paper notes vary but may not exceed\n397\ndays from the date of issuance. The commercial paper notes are sold under customary\n117\nterms in the commercial paper market and are issued at a discount from par, or, alternatively, are sold at par and bear varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. The net proceeds of issuances of the commercial paper notes are expected to be used to fund planned capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nno\ncommercial paper was outstanding.\nCash Payments for Interest (Net of Amounts Capitalized)\nCash payments for interest (net of amounts capitalized)\nwere $\n1.149\nbillion in 2020, $\n1.153\nbillion in 2019, and  $\n1.064\nbillion in 2018.\nNote 15 – Leases\nWe are a lessee through noncancellable lease agreements for property and equipment consisting primarily of buildings, land, vehicles, and equipment used in both our operations and administrative functions.\nPrior to adopting ASU 2016-02 “Leases (Topic 842)”, which was effective January 1, 2019, total rent expense was $\n73\nmillion in 2018 and primarily included in\nOperating and maintenance expenses\nand\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n118\nAs of December 31, 2020, the following table represents our operating lease maturities, including renewal provisions that we have assessed as being reasonably certain of exercise, for each of the years ended December 31:\nWe are the lessor to certain lease agreements for office space in our headquarters building, which are insignificant to our financial statements.\nNote 16 – Stockholders' Equity\nOn January 26, 2021, our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend to common stockholders of $\n0.41\nper share payable on March 29, 2021.\nStockholder Rights Agreement\nOn March 19, 2020, our board of directors approved the adoption of a limited duration stockholder rights agreements (Rights Agreement) and declared a distribution of\none\npreferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock. The Rights Agreement is intended to protect the interests of us and our stockholders by reducing the likelihood of another party gaining control of or significant influence over us without paying an appropriate premium considering recent volatile markets. Each preferred stock purchase right represents the right to purchase, upon certain terms and conditions, one one-thousandths (\n.001\n) of a share of Series C Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, $\n1.00\npar value per share. Each one-thousandth (\n.001\n) of a share of Series C Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, if issued, would have rights similar to one share of our common stock. The distribution of preferred stock purchase rights occurred on March 30, 2020, to holders of record as of the close of business on that date. The Rights Agreement expires on March 20, 2021. Please see our Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 20, 2020, for additional details of the Rights Agreement.\nOn August 27, 2020, a purported shareholder filed a putative class action lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery challenging the Rights Agreement. The plaintiff alleges that the individual members of our board of directors breached their fiduciary duties by adopting the Rights Agreement. On September 3, 2020, a purported shareholder filed a separate putative class action lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery, asserting identical claims to the August 27, 2020, lawsuit. Both complaints seek declaratory relief, an injunction against the agreement, and an award of attorneys’ fees and costs, which are not expected to be material. The court consolidated the lawsuits. The trial occurred January 12 through January 14, 2021, and we are awaiting the court’s decision.\nIssuance of Preferred Stock\nIn July 2018, through a wholly owned subsidiary, we contributed\n35,000\nshares of newly issued Series B Non-Voting Perpetual Preferred Stock (Preferred Stock) to The Williams Companies Foundation, Inc. (a not-for-profit corporation) for use in future charitable and nonprofit causes. The charitable contribution of Preferred Stock was recorded as an expense in the third quarter of 2018. The Preferred Stock was issued for an aggregate value of $\n35\nmillion and pays non-cumulative quarterly cash dividends when, as and if declared, at a rate of\n7.25\npercent per year.  Our certificate of incorporation authorizes\n30\nmillion shares of Preferred Stock, $\n1\npar value per share.\n119\nAOCI\nThe following table presents the changes in\nAOCI\nby component, net of income taxes:\nReclassifications out of AOCI are presented in the following table by component for the year ended December 31, 2020:\nNote 17 – Equity-Based Compensation\nWilliams’ Plan Information\nThe Williams Companies, Inc. 2007 Incentive Plan (the Plan) provides common-stock-based awards to both employees and nonmanagement directors. To date,\n50\nmillion new shares have been authorized for making awards under the Plan, including\n10\nmillion shares added on April 28, 2020. The Plan permits the granting of various types of awards including, but not limited to, restricted stock units and stock options. At December 31, 2020,\n31\nmillion shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to existing and future stock awards, of which\n19\nmillion shares were available for future grants.\nAdditionally, up to\n5.2\nmillion new shares of our common stock have been authorized to date to be available for sale under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), including\n1.6\nmillion shares added on April 28, 2020. Employees purchased\n347\nthousand shares at a weighted-average price of $\n16.07\nper share during 2020. Approximately\n1.7\nmillion shares were available for purchase under the ESPP at December 31, 2020.\nOperating and maintenance expenses\nand\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations include equity-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 of $\n52\nmillion,\n$\n57\nmillion, and $\n54\nmillion, respectively. Income tax benefit recognized related to the stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $\n13\nmillion, $\n14\nmillion, and $\n14\nmillion, respectively. Measured but unrecognized stock-based compensation expense at December 31, 2020, was $\n57\nmillion, substantially all of which related to restricted stock units. These amounts are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.7\nyears.\n120\nNonvested Restricted Stock Units\nThe following summary reflects nonvested restricted stock unit activity and related information for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n______________\n(1)\nPerformance-based restricted stock units are valued considering measures of total shareholder return utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation method, as well as return on capital employed and a ratio of debt to EBITDA. All other restricted stock units are valued at the grant-date market price. Restricted stock units generally vest after\nthree years\n.\nPerformance-based restricted stock units granted under the Plan represent\n41\npercent of nonvested restricted stock units outstanding at December 31, 2020. These grants may be earned at the end of the vesting period based on actual performance against a performance target. Based on the extent to which certain financial targets are achieved, vested shares may range from\nzero\npercent to\n200\npercent of the original grant amount.\nStock Options\nThe following summary reflects stock option activity and related information for the year ended December 31, 2020:\nThe following table summarizes additional information related to stock option activity during each of the last three years:\n121\nThe weighted-average remaining contractual lives for stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2020, were\n3.5\nyears and\n3.3\nyears, respectively.\nThe estimated fair value at date of grant of options for our common stock granted in each respective year, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, is as follows:\nThere were no stock options granted in 2020 or 2019. The expected dividend yield for each respective year is based on the dividend forecast for that year and the grant-date market price of our stock. Our expected future volatility is determined using the historical volatility of our stock and implied volatility on our traded options. Historical volatility is based on the blended\n10\n-year historical volatility of our stock and certain peer companies. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rates as of the grant date. The expected life of the option is based on historical exercise behavior and expected future experience.\nNote 18 – Fair Value Measurements, Guarantees, and Concentration of Credit Risk\nThe following table presents, by level within the fair value hierarchy, certain of our significant financial assets and liabilities. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, margin deposits, and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Therefore, these assets and liabilities are not presented in the following table.\n122\nFair Value Methods\nWe use the following methods and assumptions in estimating the fair value of our financial instruments:\nAssets measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nARO Trust investments\n:\nTransco deposits a portion of its collected rates, pursuant to its rate case settlement, into an external trust that is specifically designated to fund future ARO’s. The ARO Trust invests in a portfolio of actively traded mutual funds that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on quoted prices in an active market and is reported in\nRegulatory assets, deferred charges, and other\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses are ultimately recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities.\nAdditional fair value disclosures\nLong-term debt, including current portion\n:\nThe disclosed fair value of our long-term debt is determined primarily by a market approach using broker quoted indicative period-end bond prices. The quoted prices are based on observable transactions in less active markets for our debt or similar instruments.  The fair values of the financing obligations associated with our Dalton lateral and Atlantic Sunrise projects, which are included within long-term debt, were determined using an income approach (see Note 14 – Debt and Banking Arrangements).\nGuarantees\n:\nGuarantees primarily consist of a guarantee we have provided in the event of nonpayment by our previously owned communications subsidiary, Williams Communications Group (WilTel), on a lease performance obligation that extends through 2042. Guarantees also include an indemnification related to a disposed operation.\nTo estimate the fair value of the WilTel guarantee, an estimated default rate is applied to the sum of the future contractual lease payments using an income approach. The estimated default rate is determined by obtaining the average cumulative issuer-weighted corporate default rate based on the credit rating of WilTel’s current owner and the term of the underlying obligation. The default rate is published by Moody’s Investors Service. The carrying value of the WilTel guarantee is reported in\nAccrued liabilities\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The maximum potential undiscounted exposure is approximately $\n27\nmillion at December 31, 2020. Our exposure declines systematically through the remaining term of WilTel’s obligation.\nThe fair value of the guarantee associated with the indemnification related to a disposed operation was estimated using an income approach that considered probability-weighted scenarios of potential levels of future performance.  The terms of the indemnification do not limit the maximum potential future payments associated with the guarantee. The carrying value of this guarantee is reported in\nRegulatory liabilities, deferred income, and other\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe are required by our revolving credit agreement to indemnify lenders for certain taxes required to be withheld from payments due to the lenders and for certain tax payments made by the lenders. The maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnifications is based on the related borrowings and such future payments cannot currently be determined. These indemnifications generally continue indefinitely unless limited by the underlying tax regulations and have\nno\ncarrying value. We have never been called upon to perform under these indemnifications and have no current expectation of a future claim.\nNonrecurring fair value measurements\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, we observed a significant decline in the publicly traded price of our common stock (NYSE: WMB), which declined\n40\npercent during the quarter, including a\n26\npercent decline in the month of March. These changes were generally attributed to macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, including significant declines in crude oil prices driven by both surplus supply and a decrease in demand caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result of these conditions, we performed an interim assessment of the goodwill\n123\nassociated with our Northeast G&P reporting unit as of March 31, 2020. This goodwill resulted from the March 2019 acquisition of UEOM (see Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures).\nThe assessment considered the total fair value of the businesses within the Northeast G&P reporting unit, which was determined using income and market approaches. We utilized internally developed industry weighted-average discount rates and estimates of valuation multiples of comparable publicly traded gathering and processing companies. In assessing the fair value as of the March 31, 2020, measurement date, we were required to consider recent publicly available indications of value, which included lower observed publicly traded EBITDA market multiples as compared with recent history and significantly higher industry weighted-average discount rates. The fair value of the reporting unit was further reconciled to our estimated total enterprise value as of March 31, 2020, which considered observable valuation multiples of comparable publicly traded companies applied to each distinct business including the Northeast G&P reporting unit. This assessment indicated that the estimated fair value of the Northeast G&P reporting unit was below its carrying value, including goodwill. As a result of this Level 3 measurement, we recognized a full impairment charge of $\n187\nmillion as of March 31, 2020, in\nImpairment of goodwill\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Our partner’s $\n65\nmillion share of this impairment is reflected within\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations (see Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures).\nThe following table presents impairments of assets and equity-method investments associated with certain nonrecurring fair value measurements within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, except as specifically noted.\n124\n______________\n(1)\nRelates to capitalized project development costs for the Northeast Supply Enhancement project. As previously disclosed, approvals required for the project from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection have been denied and we have not refiled at this time. Beginning in May 2020, we discontinued capitalization of costs related to this project. Considering that the customer precedent agreements and FERC certificate for the project remain in effect, we had previously concluded that the probability of completing the project was sufficient to not require impairment. However, recent developments in the political and regulatory environments have caused us to slightly lower that assessed probability such that the capitalized project costs now required impairment. The estimated fair value of the materials within the capitalized project costs considered other internal uses and salvage values for the\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\n. The remaining capitalized costs were determined to have no fair value.\n(2)\nRelates to a gathering system in the Marcellus Shale region, that is more likely than not to be sold in the short term. The estimated fair value of the\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\nand\nIntangible assets – net of accumulated amortization\nwas determined using a market approach, which incorporated an indication of interest by a third party. These inputs resulted in a fair value measurement within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n125\n(3)\nRelates to the Constitution proposed pipeline project extending from Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, to the Iroquois Gas Transmission and the Tennessee Gas Pipeline systems in New York. Although Constitution received a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the FERC to construct and operate the proposed pipeline and obtained, among other approvals, a waiver of the water quality certification under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act for the New York portion of the project, the members of Constitution, following extensive evaluation and discussion, determined that the underlying risk-adjusted return for this greenfield pipeline project had diminished in such a way that further development was no longer supported. The estimated fair value of the\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\nwas based on probability-weighted third-party quotes. Our partners’ $\n209\nmillion share of this impairment is reflected within\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\nin the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n(4)\nRelates to a gas gathering system in the Eagle Ford Shale region with expected declines in asset utilization and possible idling of the gathering system. We designated these operations as held for sale, included in\nOther current assets and deferred charges\n, as of December 31, 2019. As a result, we measured the fair value of the disposal group using the expected sales price under a contract with a third party. These inputs resulted in a fair value measurement within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The estimated fair value of the\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\nat June 30, 2019, was determined using a market approach, which incorporated indications of interest from third parties.\n(5)\nReflects impairment of\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\nthat is no longer in use for which the fair value was determined to be lower than the carrying value.\n(6)\nRelates to our gathering operations in the Barnett Shale region. Certain of our contractual gathering rates, primarily those in the Barnett Shale region, are based on a percentage of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas prices. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we determined there was a sustained decline in the forward price curves for natural gas. During this same period, a large producer customer in the Barnett Shale region removed their remaining drilling rig. These factors gave rise to an impairment evaluation of these assets, which incorporated management’s projections of future drilling activity and gathering rates, taking into consideration the information previously noted as well as recently available information regarding producer drilling cost assumptions in the basin. The resulting estimate of future undiscounted cash flows was less than our carrying value, necessitating the estimation of the fair value of the\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\nand\nIntangible assets – net of accumulated amortization\n. To arrive at the fair value, we utilized an income approach with a discount rate of\n8.5\npercent, reflecting an estimated cost of capital and risks associated with the underlying assets.\n(7)\nRelates to certain idle pipelines. The estimated fair value of the\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\nwas determined by a market approach incorporating information derived from bids received for these assets, which we marketed for sale together with certain other assets. These inputs resulted in a fair value measurement within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We sold these assets in the fourth quarter of 2018. (See Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures.)\n(8)\nReflects multiple individually insignificant impairments and write-downs of other certain assets that may no longer be in use or are surplus in nature for which the fair value was determined to be lower than the carrying value.\n(9)\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, RMM renegotiated service contracts with a significant customer in connection with the customer’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. The renegotiated contracts result in lower service rates and lower projected future cash flows. As a result, we evaluated this investment for other-than-temporary impairment.  The fair value was measured using an income approach.  We utilized a discount rate of\n18\npercent in our analysis\n.\n126\n(10)\nFollowing the previously described declining market conditions during the first quarter of 2020, we evaluated these investments for other-than-temporary impairment. The fair value was measured using an income approach. Both investees operate in primarily oil-driven basins where significant expected reductions in producer activities led to reduced estimates of expected future cash flows. Our fair value estimates also reflected discount rates of approximately\n17\npercent for these investments. We also considered any debt held at the investee level, and its impact to fair value. The industry weighted-average discount rates utilized were significantly influenced by the recent market declines previously discussed.\n(11)\nFollowing the previously described declining market conditions during the first quarter of 2020, we evaluated these investments for other-than-temporary impairment.  The impairments within our Northeast G&P segment are primarily associated with operations in wet-gas areas where producer drilling activities are influenced by NGL prices which historically trend with crude oil prices. The fair values of our investments in Caiman II and Aux Sable Liquid Products LP (Aux Sable) were estimated using a market approach, reflecting valuation multiples ranging from\n5.0\nx to\n6.2\nx EBITDA (weighted-average\n6.0\nx). The fair values of the other investments, including gathering systems that are part of Appalachia Midstream Investments, were estimated using an income approach, with discount rates ranging from\n9.7\npercent to\n13.5\npercent (weighted-average\n12.6\npercent). We also considered any debt held at the investee level, and its impact to fair value. The assumed valuation multiples and industry weighted-average discount rates utilized were both significantly influenced by the recent market declines previously discussed.\n(12)\nRelates to a gas gathering system in the Marcellus Shale region that was adversely impacted by lower sustained forward natural gas price expectations and changes in expected producer activity. The estimated fair value was determined using an income approach. We utilized a discount rate of\n10.2\npercent in our analysis.\n(13)\nRelates to a certain gathering system held in Appalachia Midstream Investments that was adversely impacted by changes in the timing of expected producer activity. The estimated fair value was determined using an income approach. We utilized a discount rate of\n9\npercent in our analysis.\n(14)\nThe estimated fair value of Pennant Midstream, LLC (Pennant) was determined by a market approach based on recent observable third-party transactions. These inputs resulted in a fair value measurement within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n(15)\nThe estimated fair value at March 17, 2019, was determined by a market approach based on the transaction price for the purchase of the remaining interest in UEOM as finalized just prior to the signing and closing of the acquisition in March 2019 (see Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures). These inputs resulted in a fair value measurement within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The estimated fair value at December 31, 2018, was determined by a market approach based on our analysis of inputs in the principal market.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe following table summarizes concentration of receivables, net of allowances:\n127\nCustomers include producers, distribution companies, industrial users, gas marketers, and pipelines primarily located in the continental United States. As a general policy, collateral is not required for receivables, but customers’ financial condition and credit worthiness are evaluated regularly. Based upon this evaluation, we may obtain collateral to support receivables.\nNote 19 – Contingent Liabilities and Commitments\nReporting of Natural Gas-Related Information to Trade Publications\nDirect and indirect purchasers of natural gas in various states filed individual and class actions against us, our former affiliate WPX Energy, Inc. (WPX) and its subsidiaries, and others alleging the manipulation of published gas price indices and seeking unspecified amounts of damages. Such actions were transferred to the Nevada federal district court for consolidation of discovery and pre-trial issues. We have agreed to indemnify WPX and its subsidiaries related to this matter.\nIn the individual action, filed by Farmland Industries Inc. (Farmland), the court issued an order on May 24, 2016, granting one of our co-defendant’s motion for summary judgment as to Farmland’s claims. On January 5, 2017, the court extended such ruling to us, entering final judgment in our favor. Farmland appealed. On March 27, 2018, the appellate court reversed the district court’s grant of summary judgment, and on April 10, 2018, the defendants filed a petition for rehearing with the appellate court, which was denied on May 9, 2018. The case was remanded to the Nevada federal district court and subsequently remanded to its originally filed court, the Kansas federal district court where we re-urged our motion for summary judgment. The district court denied the motion but granted our request to seek permission for an immediate appeal to the appellate court. Oral argument occurred before the appellate court on January 19, 2021.\nIn the putative class actions, on March 30, 2017, the court issued an order denying the plaintiffs’ motions for class certification. On June 13, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted the plaintiffs’ petition for permission to appeal the order. On August 6, 2018, the Ninth Circuit reversed the order denying class certification and remanded the case to the Nevada federal district court.\nWe reached an agreement to settle two of the actions, and on April 22, 2019, the Nevada federal district court preliminarily approved the settlements, which are on behalf of Kansas and Missouri class members. The final  fairness hearing on the settlement occurred August 5, 2019, and a final judgment of dismissal with prejudice was entered the same day.\nTwo putative class actions remain unresolved, and they have been remanded to their originally filed court, the Wisconsin federal district court. Trial is scheduled to begin June 14, 2021.\nBecause of the uncertainty around the remaining unresolved issues, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of potential exposure at this time. However, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of these actions and our related indemnification obligation could result in a potential loss that may be material to our results of operations. In connection with this indemnification, we have an accrued liability balance associated with this matter and, as a result, have exposure to future developments.\nAlaska Refinery Contamination Litigation\nWe are involved in litigation arising from our ownership and operation of the North Pole Refinery in North Pole, Alaska, from 1980 until 2004, through our wholly owned subsidiaries Williams Alaska Petroleum Inc. (WAPI) and MAPCO Inc. We sold the refinery to Flint Hills Resources Alaska, LLC (FHRA), a subsidiary of Koch Industries, Inc., in 2004. The litigation involves three cases, with filing dates ranging from 2010 to 2014. The actions primarily arise from sulfolane contamination allegedly emanating from the refinery. A putative class action lawsuit was filed by James West in 2010 naming us, WAPI, and FHRA as defendants. We and FHRA filed claims against each other seeking, among other things, contractual indemnification alleging that the other party caused the sulfolane contamination. In 2011, we and FHRA settled the claim with James West. Certain claims by FHRA\n128\nagainst us were resolved by the Alaska Supreme Court in our favor. FHRA’s claims against us for contractual indemnification and statutory claims for damages related to off-site sulfolane were remanded to the Alaska Superior Court. The State of Alaska filed its action in March 2014, seeking damages. The City of North Pole (North Pole) filed its lawsuit in November 2014, seeking past and future damages, as well as punitive damages. Both we and WAPI asserted counterclaims against the State of Alaska and North Pole, and cross-claims against FHRA. FHRA has also filed cross-claims against us.\nThe underlying factual basis and claims in the cases are similar and may duplicate exposure. As such, in February 2017, the three cases were consolidated into one action in state court containing the remaining claims from the James West case and those of the State of Alaska and North Pole. The State of Alaska later announced the discovery of additional contaminants per- and polyfluoralkyl (PFOS and PFOA) offsite of the refinery, and the court permitted the State of Alaska to amend its complaint to add a claim for offsite PFOS/PFOA contamination. The court subsequently remanded the offsite PFOS/PFOA claims to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation for investigation and stayed the claims pending their potential resolution at the administrative agency. Several trial dates encompassing all three cases have been scheduled and stricken. In the summer of 2019, the court deconsolidated the cases for purposes of trial. A bench trial on all claims except North Pole’s claims began in October 2019.\nIn January 2020, the Alaska Superior Court issued its Memorandum of Decision finding in favor of the State of Alaska and FHRA, with the total incurred and potential future damages estimated to be $\n86\nmillion. The court found that FHRA is not entitled to contractual indemnification from us because FHRA contributed to the sulfolane contamination. On March 23, 2020, the court entered final judgment in the case. Filing deadlines were stayed until May 1, 2020. However, on April 21, 2020, we filed a Notice of Appeal. We also filed post-judgment motions including a Motion for New Trial and a Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment. These post-trial motions were resolved with the court’s denial of the last motion on June 11, 2020. Our Statement of Points on Appeal was filed on July 13, 2020. On June 22, 2020, the court stayed the North Pole’s case pending resolution of the appeal in the State of Alaska and FHRA case. On December 23, 2020, we filed our opening brief on appeal. We have recorded an accrued liability in the amount of our estimate of the probable loss. It is reasonably possible that we may not be successful on appeal and could ultimately pay up to the amount of judgment.\nRoyalty Matters\nCertain of our customers, including Chesapeake, have been named in various lawsuits alleging underpayment of royalties and claiming, among other things, violations of anti-trust laws and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. We have also been named as a defendant in certain of these cases filed in Pennsylvania based on allegations that we improperly participated with Chesapeake in causing the alleged royalty underpayments. We believe that the claims asserted are subject to indemnity obligations owed to us by Chesapeake. Chesapeake has reached a tentative settlement to resolve substantially all Pennsylvania royalty cases pending, which settlement would apply to both Chesapeake and us. The settlement as reported would not require any contribution from us.\nLitigation Against Energy Transfer and Related Parties\nOn April 6, 2016, we filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court against Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (Energy Transfer) and LE GP, LLC (the general partner for Energy Transfer) alleging willful and material breaches of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (ETE Merger Agreement) with Energy Transfer resulting from the private offering by Energy Transfer on March 8, 2016, of Series A Convertible Preferred Units (Special Offering) to certain Energy Transfer insiders and other accredited investors. The suit seeks, among other things, an injunction ordering the defendants to unwind the Special Offering and to specifically perform their obligations under the ETE Merger Agreement. On April 19, 2016, we filed an amended complaint seeking the same relief. On May 3, 2016, Energy Transfer and LE GP, LLC filed an answer and counterclaims.\nOn May 13, 2016, we filed a separate complaint in Delaware Chancery Court against Energy Transfer, LE GP, LLC and the other Energy Transfer affiliates that are parties to the ETE Merger Agreement, alleging material\n129\nbreaches of the ETE Merger Agreement for failing to cooperate and use necessary efforts to obtain a tax opinion required under the ETE Merger Agreement (Tax Opinion) and for otherwise failing to use necessary efforts to consummate the merger under the ETE Merger Agreement wherein we would be merged with and into the newly formed Energy Transfer Corp LP (ETC) (ETC Merger). The suit sought, among other things, a declaratory judgment and injunction preventing Energy Transfer from terminating or otherwise avoiding its obligations under the ETE Merger Agreement due to any failure to obtain the Tax Opinion.\nThe Court of Chancery coordinated the Special Offering and Tax Opinion suits. On May 20, 2016, the Energy Transfer defendants filed amended affirmative defenses and verified counterclaims in the Special Offering and Tax Opinion suits, alleging certain breaches of the ETE Merger Agreement by us and seeking, among other things, a declaration that we were not entitled to specific performance, that Energy Transfer could terminate the ETC Merger, and that Energy Transfer is entitled to a $\n1.48\nbillion termination fee. On June 24, 2016, following a two-day trial, the court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order denying our requested relief in the Tax Opinion suit. The court did not rule on the substance of our claims related to the Special Offering or on the substance of Energy Transfer’s counterclaims. On June 27, 2016, we filed an appeal of the court’s decision with the Supreme Court of Delaware, seeking reversal and remand to pursue damages. On March 23, 2017, the Supreme Court of Delaware affirmed the Court of Chancery’s ruling. On March 30, 2017, we filed a motion for reargument with the Supreme Court of Delaware, which was denied on April 5, 2017.\nOn September 16, 2016, we filed an amended complaint with the Court of Chancery seeking damages for breaches of the ETE Merger Agreement by defendants.  On September 23, 2016, Energy Transfer filed a second amended and supplemental affirmative defenses and verified counterclaim with the Court of Chancery seeking, among other things, payment of the $\n1.48\nbillion termination fee due to our alleged breaches of the ETE Merger Agreement. On December 1, 2017, the court granted our motion to dismiss certain of Energy Transfer’s counterclaims, including its claim seeking payment of the $\n1.48\nbillion termination fee. On December 8, 2017, Energy Transfer filed a motion for reargument, which the Court of Chancery denied on April 16, 2018. The Court of Chancery had scheduled trial for May 20 through May 24, 2019; the court struck this setting and reset the trial for June 8 through June 11, and June 15, 2020. Due to COVID-19, the court struck the June 2020 setting and re-scheduled the trial for August 31 through September 4, 2020; this setting was also struck as a result of COVID-19. The court reset trial for December 14 through December 18, 2020, but also struck this setting as a result of COVID-19. Trial has been reset for May 10 through May 17, 2021.\nFormer Olefins Business\nSABIC Petrochemicals, the other interest owner in our former Geismar, Louisiana, olefins facility we sold in July 2017, sought recovery from us for losses it allegedly suffered, including its share of personal injury settlements in which it was a co-defendant, as well as amounts related to lost income, defense costs, and property damage associated with an explosion and fire at the plant in June 2013. We settled this claim with SABIC Petrochemicals in the fourth quarter 2020. Part of the settlement is covered by our general liability policy and any uninsured losses are immaterial.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are a participant in certain environmental activities in various stages including assessment studies, cleanup operations, and/or remedial processes at certain sites, some of which we currently do not own. We are monitoring these sites in a coordinated effort with other potentially responsible parties, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or other governmental authorities. We are jointly and severally liable along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities and solely responsible in others. Certain of our subsidiaries have been identified as potentially responsible parties at various Superfund and state waste disposal sites. In addition, these subsidiaries have incurred, or are alleged to have incurred, various other hazardous materials removal or remediation obligations under environmental laws. As of December 31, 2020, we have accrued liabilities totaling $\n33\nmillion for these matters, as discussed below. Estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally based on completed assessment studies, preliminary results of studies, or our experience with other similar cleanup operations. At\n130\nDecember 31, 2020, certain assessment studies were still in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield different estimates of most likely costs. Therefore, the actual costs incurred will depend on the final amount, type, and extent of contamination discovered at these sites, the final cleanup standards mandated by the EPA or other governmental authorities, and other factors.\nThe EPA and various state regulatory agencies routinely promulgate and propose new rules and issue updated guidance to existing rules. These rulemakings include, but are not limited to, rules for reciprocating internal combustion engine and combustion turbine maximum achievable control technology, air quality standards for one-hour nitrogen dioxide emissions, and volatile organic compound and methane new source performance standards impacting design and operation of storage vessels, pressure valves, and compressors. The EPA previously issued its rule regarding National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ground-level ozone. We are monitoring the rule’s implementation as it will trigger additional federal and state regulatory actions that may impact our operations. Implementation of the regulations is expected to result in impacts to our operations and increase the cost of additions to\nProperty, plant, and equipment – net\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet for both new and existing facilities in affected areas. We are unable to reasonably estimate the cost of additions that may be required to meet the regulations at this time due to uncertainty created by various legal challenges to these regulations and the need for further specific regulatory guidance.\nContinuing operations\nOur interstate gas pipelines are involved in remediation activities related to certain facilities and locations for polychlorinated biphenyls, mercury, and other hazardous substances. These activities have involved the EPA and various state environmental authorities, resulting in our identification as a potentially responsible party at various Superfund waste sites. At December 31, 2020, we have accrued liabilities of $\n4\nmillion for these costs. We expect that these costs will be recoverable through rates.\nWe also accrue environmental remediation costs for natural gas underground storage facilities, primarily related to soil and groundwater contamination. At December 31, 2020, we have accrued liabilities totaling $\n8\nmillion for these costs.\nFormer operations\nWe have potential obligations in connection with assets and businesses we no longer operate. These potential obligations include remediation activities at the direction of federal and state environmental authorities and the indemnification of the purchasers of certain of these assets and businesses for environmental and other liabilities existing at the time the sale was consummated. Our responsibilities relate to the operations of the assets and businesses described below.\n•\nFormer agricultural fertilizer and chemical operations and former retail petroleum and refining operations;\n•\nFormer petroleum products and natural gas pipelines;\n•\nFormer petroleum refining facilities;\n•\nFormer exploration and production and mining operations;\n•\nFormer electricity and natural gas marketing and trading operations.\nAt December 31, 2020, we have accrued environmental liabilities of $\n21\nmillion related to these matters.\nOther Divestiture Indemnifications\nPursuant to various purchase and sale agreements relating to divested businesses and assets, we have indemnified certain purchasers against liabilities that they may incur with respect to the businesses and assets acquired from us. The indemnities provided to the purchasers are customary in sale transactions and are contingent\n131\nupon the purchasers incurring liabilities that are not otherwise recoverable from third parties. The indemnities generally relate to breach of warranties, tax, historic litigation, personal injury, property damage, environmental matters, right of way, and other representations that we have provided.\nAt December 31, 2020, other than as previously disclosed, we are not aware of any material claims against us involving the above-described indemnities; thus, we do not expect any of the indemnities provided pursuant to the sales agreements to have a material impact on our future financial position. Any claim for indemnity brought against us in the future may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the claim is made.\nIn addition to the foregoing, various other proceedings are pending against us that are incidental to our operations, none of which are expected to be material to our expected future annual results of operations, liquidity, and financial position.\nSummary\nWe have disclosed our estimated range of reasonably possible losses for certain matters above, as well as all significant matters for which we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. We estimate that for all other matters for which we are able to reasonably estimate a range of loss, our aggregate reasonably possible losses beyond amounts accrued are immaterial to our expected future annual results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. These calculations have been made without consideration of any potential recovery from third parties.\nCommitments\nCommitments for construction and acquisition of property, plant, and equipment are approximately $\n262\nmillion at December 31, 2020.\nNote 20 – Segment Disclosures\nOur reportable segments are Transmission & Gulf of Mexico, Northeast G&P, and West. All remaining business activities are included in Other. (See Note 1 – General, Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.)\nPerformance Measurement\nWe evaluate segment operating performance based upon\nModified EBITDA\n. This measure represents the basis of our internal financial reporting and is the primary performance measure used by our chief operating decision maker in measuring performance and allocating resources among our reportable segments. Intersegment revenues primarily represent the sale of NGLs from our natural gas processing plants and transportation services provided to our marketing business.\nWe define\nModified EBITDA\nas follows:\n•\nNet income (loss) before:\n◦\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations;\n◦\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes;\n◦\nInterest incurred, net of interest capitalized;\n◦\nEquity earnings (losses);\n◦\nImpairment of equity-method investments;\n◦\nOther investing income (loss)\n–\nnet;\n132\n◦\nImpairment of goodwill;\n◦\nDepreciation and amortization expenses;\n◦\nAccretion expense associated with asset retirement obligations for nonregulated operations.\n•\nThis measure is further adjusted to include our proportionate share (based on ownership interest) of\nModified EBITDA\nfrom our equity-method investments calculated consistently with the definition described above.\n133\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation of\nSegment revenues\nto\nTotal revenues\nas reported in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and\nOther financial information\n:\n134\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation of\nModified EBITDA\nto\nNet income (loss)\nas reported in the Consolidated Statement of Operations:\n135\nThe following table reflects\nTotal assets\nand\nEquity-method investments\nby reportable segments:\n______________\n(1)\nEliminations primarily relate to the intercompany notes and accounts receivable generated by our cash management program.\nNote 21 – Subsequent Event\nIn February 2021, we acquired certain oil and gas properties, primarily approximately\n2,000\noperated wells, in the Wamsutter basin in Wyoming from a supermajor oil and gas company for a total of $\n79\nmillion paid from cash on hand. We are working to identify an operating partner to optimize development of the properties and enhance the value of our connected midstream infrastructure. We expect to report these operations within our Other segment.\n136\nThe Williams Companies, Inc.\nSchedule II — Valuation and Qualifying Accounts\n__________\n(1)\nDeducted from related assets.\n137"

    "text": "Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a - 15(e) and 15d - 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act) (Disclosure Controls) will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We monitor our Disclosure Controls and make modifications as necessary; our intent in this regard is that the Disclosure Controls will be modified as systems change and conditions warrant.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Disclosure Controls was performed as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these Disclosure Controls are effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes during the fourth quarter of 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a - 15(f) and 15d - 15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and board of directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\n138\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework\n(2013). Based on our assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nErnst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n139\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Stockholders and the Board of Directors of\nThe Williams Companies, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited The Williams Companies, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, The Williams Companies, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 24, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nTulsa, Oklahoma\nFebruary 24, 2021\n140"
