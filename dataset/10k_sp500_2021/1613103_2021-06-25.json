We strive to be the employer of choice for the best and brightest global talent, where employees can grow and develop fulfilling careers. We aspire to create a truly inclusive, diverse, and equitable workplace that fosters innovation and creativity, and where every employee feels a sense of belonging and well-being. More than 99 percent of Medtronic’s 90,000+ employees work full-time. Forty-four percent of our employees are based in the U.S. or Puerto Rico.\nInclusion, Diversity & Equity\nWe believe that improving health for people from all walks of life depends on our ability to unleash the creative power of our diverse global employees. By breaking down barriers to Inclusion, Diversity and Equity, we open doors for everyone, driving progress and prosperity around the world. As of the end of fiscal year 2021, 38 percent of our U.S. workforce is ethnically diverse; women comprise 50 percent of our global workforce; and 40 percent of our people leaders, manager level and above, are women. Additionally, Medtronic employee resource groups (ERGs) are employee-led affinity groups that provide career development and networking opportunities for members and strengthen ties between employees of many different backgrounds, cultures, and interests. In fiscal year 2021, there were 12 ERGs across 70 countries with more than 26,000 members.\nPay Equity\nFor fiscal year 2021, in the United States we have achieved 100% pay equity for gender and 99% pay equity for ethnically diverse employees. Globally we have achieved 99% pay equity for gender. We are actively working to close any remaining pay gaps by continuing to expand the annual pay equity analyses for each country in which we operate.\n9\nWorkforce Compensation\nOur compensation framework is designed to celebrate the value and contributions of our employees. We aim to create a feeling of personal and professional security at Medtronic and are committed to transparent communications on compensation. Our competitive approach to compensation reflects industry benchmarks and local market standards. Our programs include annual and long-term incentives that provide the means to share in the company’s success. To attract the best leaders, we offer competitive benefits and cash and equity incentives. We reward high-performing employees with an ownership stake in the company through restricted stock, and all employees have the opportunity to purchase stock at a discount.\nLearning & Development\nThe skills and dedication of our employees drive our business performance. Our comprehensive professional development programs empower our people to build rewarding careers and help us attract world-class talent. Our suite of professional development programs ensures that our employees, regardless of level, location, language or learning preferences, have access to opportunities to develop and grow. Our investment in employee development has contributed to more than 30 percent of our open roles being filled with internal employees.\nEmployee Engagement\nThrough our organizational health survey, we gain valuable insight into the Medtronic employee experience and identify areas where we can improve in four key priority areas: 1) Employee Engagement, 2) Inclusion, 3) Innovation, and 4) Ethics. In our most recent survey ending in May 2021, more than 83 percent of our employees responded, an increase in participation over prior year (79 percent). Medtronic carefully reviews and implements actions based on employee feedback in order to partner and create an inclusive, innovative and supportive environment.\nHealth & Safety\nAs a large, global employer, it is our responsibility to maintain a safe workplace and support the well-being of our employees. As we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, we have placed a high priority on employee health, providing accommodations and resources to support our workforce through this challenging time.\nTo help limit exposure to the coronavirus, we acted to ensure employees in business-critical functions who cannot work from home are protected, including those in research and development, quality, manufacturing, distribution, and sales. Personal protective equipment, increased sanitation, social distancing guidance, and facility updates (one-way hallways, cafeteria partitions and extra sinks) are provided to protect our employees.\nThe Medtronic Employee Assistance Program and the Medtronic Employee Emergency Assistance Fund have historically supported employees and their families when faced with difficult times by providing a variety of services such as mental health and financial counseling and support at no cost. Both programs have proven invaluable in navigating our employees through unique challenges during the pandemic.\nFor more information on Human Capital Management at Medtronic, please refer to our 2020 Integrated Report as well as Medtronic’s 2020 Global Inclusion, Diversity and Equity Report available on our company website.\nOTHER FACTORS IMPACTING OUR OPERATIONS\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic (\"COVID-19\" or the \"pandemic\"), together with the preventative and precautionary measures taken by businesses, communities and governments, has impacted, and may continue to impact significant aspects of our Company and business, including demand for our products, our operations, supply chains and distribution systems, and our ability to research and develop and bring new products and services to market. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResearch and Development\nThe markets in which we participate are subject to rapid technological advances. Constant improvement of existing products and introduction of new products is necessary to maintain market leadership. Our research and development (R&D) efforts are directed toward maintaining or achieving technological leadership in each of the markets we serve to help ensure that patients using our devices and therapies receive the most advanced and effective treatment possible. We remain committed to developing technological enhancements and new indications for existing products, and less invasive and new technologies for new and emerging markets to address unmet patient needs. That commitment leads to our initiation and participation in many\n10\nclinical trials each fiscal year as the demand for clinical and economic evidence remains high. Furthermore, our development activities are intended to help reduce patient care costs and the length of hospital stays in the future. We have not engaged in significant customer or government-sponsored research.\nOur R&D activities include improving existing products and therapies, expanding their indications and applications for use, developing new therapies and procedures, and entering into arrangements with third parties to fund the development of certain technologies. We continue to focus on optimizing innovation, improving our R&D productivity, driving growth in emerging markets, generating clinical evidence, and assessing our R&D programs based on their ability to address unmet clinical needs, produce better patient outcomes, and create new standards of care.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets, and agreements (non-disclosure and non-competition agreements) to protect our business and proprietary technology. In addition, we have entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses relating to a wide array of third-party technologies. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to any segment of our business or to our business as a whole.\nWe operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation may result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products. At any given time, we are involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. For additional information, see Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSales and Distribution\nWe sell most of our medical devices and therapies through direct sales representatives in the U.S. and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in markets outside the U.S. For certain portions of our business, we also sell through distributors in the U.S. Additionally, a portion of the Company's revenue is generated from consignment inventory maintained at hospitals. Our medical supplies products are used primarily in hospitals, surgical centers, and alternate care facilities, such as home care and long-term care facilities, and are marketed to materials managers, GPOs and integrated delivery networks (IDNs). We often negotiate with GPOs and IDNs, which enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities. Our four largest markets are the U.S., Western Europe, China, and Japan. Emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity, as we believe they remain under-penetrated.\nOur marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid, cost-effective delivery of high-quality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide. To achieve this objective, our marketing and sales teams are organized around physician specialties. This focus enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives who are able to foster strong relationships with physicians and other customers and enhance our ability to cross-sell complementary products.\nWe are not dependent on any single customer for more than 10 percent of our total net sales.\nCompetition, Industry, and Cost Containment\nWe compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in\nmore\nthan 150 countries throughout the world. These markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. Our product lines face a mix of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products. In addition, we face competition from providers of other medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies.\nMajor shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems, physician advisories, safety alerts, results of clinical trials to support superiority claims, and publications about our products, reflecting the importance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in the medical device industry. In the current environment of managed care, economically motivated customers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition, declining reimbursement rates, and national tender pricing, competitively priced product offerings are essential to our business. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, maintain high-quality manufacturing processes, and successfully market these products.\nGovernment and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, bidding and tender mechanics, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the U.S. These initiatives\n11\nput increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical devices and therapies. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private healthcare insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments, tying reimbursement to outcomes, shifting to population health management, and other mechanisms. Hospitals, which purchase our technology, are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms, including, for example, centralized purchasing, and in some cases, limiting the number of vendors that may participate in the purchasing program. Hospitals are also aligning interests with physicians through employment and other arrangements, such as gainsharing, where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from changes in practice patterns such as device standardization. This has created an increased level of price sensitivity among customers for our products.\nProduction and Availability of Raw Materials\nWe manufacture products at manufacturing facilities located in various countries throughout the world. We purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries. Certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to help ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. Generally, we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components. However, due to the U.S. FDA’s manufacturing requirements, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials if we experience a sudden or unexpected reduction or interruption in supply and are unable to develop alternative sources.\nFor additional information related to our manufacturing facilities refer to “Item 2. Properties” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur operations and products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies, including the U.S. FDA, European regulatory authorities such as the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom Republic of Ireland and the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices in Germany, the China\nNational Medical Product Administration (NMPA)\n, and other government agencies inside and outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution and post-marketing surveillance of our products. Our business is also affected by patient and data privacy laws and government payer cost containment initiatives, as well as environmental health and safety laws and regulations.\nProduct Approval and Monitoring\nMany countries where we sell medical devices subject such medical devices and technologies to their own approval and other regulatory requirements regarding performance, safety, and quality of our products. Authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device in the U.S. is generally obtained in one of two ways. The first, known as pre-market notification or the 510(k) process, requires us to demonstrate that our medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device. The second, more rigorous process, known as pre-market approval, requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective for its intended use. This process is generally much more time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) process.\nIn the E.U., a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the CE Mark. To obtain a CE Mark, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality (i.e., the essential requirements), and then, according to their classification, comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes. The competent authorities of the E.U. countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. A new Medical Device Regulation was published by the E.U. in 2017 which imposes significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements (EU MDR). The regulation provided an implementation period and became effective on May 26, 2021. Medical devices marketed in the E.U. will require certification according to these new requirements, except that devices with valid CE certificates, issued pursuant to the Medical Device Directives before May 2020, can be placed on the market until May 2024.\nThe global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and ultimately, our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products. Regulations of the U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies in and outside the U.S. impose extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on our business. These agencies review our design and manufacturing practices, labeling, record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential\n12\nproblems with marketed medical devices. We are also subject to periodic inspections for compliance with applicable quality system regulations, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, and servicing of finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory bodies, both in and outside the U.S. (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and various state Attorneys General), monitor the promotion and advertising of our products. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may limit our ability to effectively market and sell our products, limit our ability to obtain future premarket approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. For additional information, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\"\nWe are subject to extensive and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations\n.\nIn April 2015, we entered into a consent decree with the U.S. FDA relating to our Pain Therapies division's SynchroMed II drug infusion system and its associated quality system. The consent decree requires us to complete certain corrections and enhancements to the SynchroMed pump and the Neuromodulation quality system. The consent decree’s limitations on our ability to manufacture and distribute the SynchroMed drug infusion system were lifted by the U.S. FDA in September 2017. The final required third-party expert audit is complete, and following a successful U.S. FDA inspection, and in coordination with the U.S. FDA, Medtronic can move to have the consent decree vacated.\nTrade Regulations\nThe movement of products, services, and investment across borders subjects us to extensive trade regulations. A variety of laws and regulations in the countries in which we transact business apply to the sale, shipment and provision of goods, services and technology across borders. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, our import, export and other business activities. We are also subject to the risk that these laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs, penalties or liabilities. Some governments also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons or entities. In addition to our need to comply with such regulations in connection with our direct activities, we also sell and provide goods, technology and services to agents, representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and end-users. If we, or the third parties through which we do business, are not in compliance with applicable import, export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action, and varying degrees of liability. Such actions may disrupt or delay sales of our products or services or result in restrictions on our distribution and sales of products or services that may materially impact our business.\nAnti-Boycott Laws\nUnder U.S. laws and regulations, U.S. companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates outside the U.S. are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities, including the sale, purchase, transfer, shipping or financing of goods or services within the U.S. or between the U.S. and countries outside of the U.S. If we, or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services, violate anti-boycott laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability.\nData Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations\nAs a business with a significant global footprint, compliance with evolving regulations and standards in data privacy and cybersecurity has resulted, and may continue to result, in increased costs, new compliance challenges, and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity. Our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including personal information, protected health information, financial information, intellectual property and other sensitive information related to our customers and workforce.\nFor example, in the U.S., the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of certain personal information and the security of medical devices are regulated at the U.S. federal and state, international and industry levels.\nU.S. federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers. Privacy and Security Rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), govern the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information by “Covered Entities,” (which are healthcare providers that submit electronic claims, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses) and by their “Business Associates” (which is anyone that performs a service on behalf of a Covered Entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not a member of the Covered Entity’s workforce). Rules under HIPAA and HITECH include specific security standards and breach notification requirements. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (through the Office of Civil Rights) has direct enforcement authority against Covered Entities and Business Associates with respect to both the Security and Privacy Rules, including civil and criminal liability. Except for certain of its operations in its Diabetes and care management services businesses, Medtronic is generally not a\n13\nCovered Entity. Medtronic also operates as a Business Associate to Covered Entities in several instances. There are comparable state laws governing the use and protection of personal health information by healthcare providers, and Medtronic may be subject to these laws in certain of its businesses.\nIn addition to the regulation of personal health information, a number of states have also adopted laws and regulations that may affect our privacy and data security practices for other kinds of personally identifiable information, such as state laws that govern the use, disclosure and protection of sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, or that are designed to protect credit card account data. State consumer protection laws may also establish privacy and security standards for use and management of personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers.\nOutside the U.S., we are impacted by the privacy and data security requirements at the international, federal and regional level, and on an industry specific basis. We serve customers in more than 150 countries. Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, handling and transfer of personal data and potentially intellectual property continue to evolve with increasingly strict enforcement regimes. More privacy and security laws and regulations are being adopted, and more are being enforced, with potential for significant financial penalties. In the E.U., stringent data protection and privacy rules which substantially impact the use of patient data across the healthcare industry became effective in May 2018. The E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies uniformly across the E.U. and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. The GDPR also requires companies based outside of the E.U. but processing personal data of individuals residing in the E.U. to comply with E.U. privacy and data protection rules.\nBecause the laws and regulations continue to expand, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject to evolving (and at times inconsistent) governmental interpretation, compliance with these laws and regulations may require significant additional cost expenditures or changes in products or business that increase competition or reduce revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities.\nRegulations Governing Reimbursement\nThe delivery of our devices is subject to regulation by HHS and comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of healthcare items and services. U.S. laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with federally funded healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as the government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of healthcare. Other governments also impose regulations in connection with their healthcare reimbursement programs and the delivery of healthcare items and services.\nU.S. federal healthcare laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federally-funded healthcare programs, including laws related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and healthcare fraud. There are often similar state false claims, anti-kickback, and anti-self-referral and insurance laws that apply to state Medicaid and other healthcare programs and private third-party payers. In some circumstances, insurance companies attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for a pattern of causing false claims. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-approved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties.\nImplementation of legislative or regulatory reforms to reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage, which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.\nEnvironmental Health and Safety Laws\nWe are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the U.S. Like other companies in our industry, our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials.\nAvailable Information\nWe maintain a website at\nwww.medtronic.com\n. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) are made available under the “About Medtronic - Investors” caption and “Financial Information - SEC Filings” subcaption of our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with, or furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n14\nInformation relating to our corporate governance, including our Principles of Corporate Governance, Code of Conduct (including our Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers and any related amendments or waivers), Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Members of the Board of Directors, and information concerning our executive officers, directors and Board committees (including committee charters) is available through our website at\nwww.medtronic.com\nunder the “About Medtronic - Corporate Governance” caption. Information relating to transactions in Medtronic securities by directors and officers is available through our website at\nwww.medtronic.com\nunder the “About Medtronic - Investors” caption and the “Financial Information - SEC Filings” subcaption.\nOur website and the information contained on or connected to our website are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.\nThe SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including the Company, that file electronically with the SEC.

    "text": "Investing in our securities involves a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, including, among others, those discussed below. Each of the following risks should be carefully considered, together with all the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and in our other filings with the SEC. Furthermore, additional risks and uncertainty not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flow and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and we may be unable to compete effectively.\nWe compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world. These markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. In the product lines in which we compete, we face a range of competitors from large companies with multiple business lines to small, specialized manufacturers that offer a limited selection of niche products. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes, technologies, or the introduction of reprocessed products or generic versions when our proprietary products lose their patent protection may make our existing or planned products less competitive. In addition, we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies.\nWe believe our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\n•\nproduct performance and reliability,\n•\nproduct technology and innovation,\n•\nproduct quality and safety,\n•\nbreadth of product lines,\n•\nproduct support services,\n•\ncustomer support,\n•\ncost-effectiveness and price,\n•\nreimbursement approval from healthcare insurance providers, and\n•\nchanges to the regulatory environment.\nCompetition may increase as additional companies enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. In addition, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also may conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring necessary product technologies. From time to time we have lost, and may in the future lose, market share in connection with product problems, physician advisories, safety alerts and publications about our products, which highlights the importance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems to our business. In the current environment of managed care, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition, declining reimbursement rates, and national tender pricing, as recently experienced in China, competitively priced product offerings are essential to our success. Further, our continued growth and success depend on our ability to develop, acquire and market new and differentiated products, technologies and intellectual property, and as a result we also face competition for marketing, distribution, and collaborative development agreements, establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and licenses to intellectual property. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create, invest\n15\nin or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into our proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, and manufacture and successfully market our products. Given these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively or continue our level of success.\nThe ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on certain aspects of our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The nature and extent of future impacts are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\nOur global operations and interactions with healthcare systems, providers and patients around the world expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19. In particular, the continuing preventative and precautionary measures that we and other businesses, communities, and governments have taken to mitigate the spread of the disease has led to restrictions on, disruptions in, and other related impacts on business and personal activities, including reduced customer demand for certain of our products and has resulted in many of our employees working remotely. We expect medical procedure rates to continue to vary by therapy and country, and could be impacted by regional COVID-19 case volumes, hospital and clinical occupancy and staffing levels, patient’s willingness to schedule deferrable procedures, travel restrictions, transportation limitations, quarantine restrictions, vaccine immunization rates, and new COVID-19 variants. While COVID-19 case volumes appear to be decreasing in the U.S and certain other countries as a result of higher vaccination rates, the global COVID-19 outlook remains uncertain as vaccination rates remain low in much of the world.\nTogether with the preventative and precautionary measures being taken, as well as the corresponding need to adapt to new and improved methods of conducting business, such as increased remote monitoring, COVID-19 is having, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on certain aspects of our Company and business, including the demand for and supply of certain of our products, operations, supply chains and distribution systems, impacts or delays to product development milestones, clinical trials, or regulatory clearances and approval timing, and our ability to generate cash flow, and may have an adverse impact on our ability to access capital. Some of our products are more sensitive to reductions in deferrable and emergent medical procedures, and, as hospital systems prioritize treatment of COVID-19 patients and otherwise comply with government guidelines, certain medical procedures have been and may continue to be suspended or postponed. The Company has certain product lines that are in higher demand as a result of COVID-19 such as ventilators, pulse oximetry, capnography, advanced parameter monitoring, and extracorporeal life support products. It is not possible to predict the timing of deferrable medical procedures and, to the extent individuals and hospital systems de-prioritize, delay or cancel these procedures, or if unemployment or loss of insurance coverage adversely impacts an individual’s ability to pay for our products and services, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could continue to be negatively affected. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has strained hospital systems around the world, resulting in adverse financial impacts to those systems that could result in reduced future expenditures for certain capital equipment and other products and services we provide, as well as potential disruption of product launches of our recently approved products.\nA number of our global suppliers, vendors, and distributors have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including employee absenteeism. These impacts could impair our ability to move our products through distribution channels to end customers, and any such delay or shortage in the supply of components or materials may result in our inability to satisfy consumer demand for certain of our products in a timely manner or at all, which could harm our reputation, future sales and profitability.\nCOVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the global economy and capital markets, including by negatively impacting demand for a number of our products, access to capital markets (including the commercial paper market), foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates, each of which may adversely impact our business and liquidity. We could experience loss of sales and profits due to delayed payments or insolvency of healthcare professionals, hospitals and other customers, suppliers and vendors facing liquidity issues. As a result, we may be compelled to take additional measures to preserve our cash flow.\nCOVID-19 could adversely impact our ability to retain key employees and the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our complex productions and operations, including our executive officers and other key members of our management team.\nWhile the impact of COVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, the nature and extent of such impact is highly uncertain and unpredictable, as we cannot predict with confidence the duration of the pandemic.\nReduction or interruption in supply or other manufacturing difficulties may adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales.\nThe manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of a sufficient amount of quality components and materials and is highly exacting and complex, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. We manufacture the majority of our products and procure important third-party services, such as sterilization services, at numerous facilities worldwide. We purchase many of\n16\nthe components, raw materials and services needed to manufacture these products from numerous suppliers in various countries. We seek to maintain continuity of supply by use of multiple options for sourcing where possible. We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials, components and services. However, for reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, or availability, certain components, raw materials and services needed to manufacture our products are obtained from a sole supplier. Although we work closely with our suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability, the supply of these components, raw materials and services may be interrupted or insufficient. In addition, due to the stringent regulations and requirements of regulatory agencies, including the U.S. FDA, regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources. Additionally, many regulatory agencies are imposing regulatory requirements on safe use of chemicals and their potential impact on health and the environment which also may impact supply constraints. Furthermore, the prices of commodities and other materials used in our products, which are often volatile and outside of our control, could adversely impact our supply. We use resins, other petroleum-based materials and pulp as raw materials in some of our products, and the prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or cost-effective manner and could result in lost sales.\nOther disruptions in the manufacturing process or product sales and fulfillment systems for any reason, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, supplier facility shut-downs, defective raw materials, natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes or wildfires, property damage or facility closures from riots or public protests, and other environmental factors and the impact of epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and actions by businesses, communities and governments in response, could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. For example, in the past we have experienced a global information technology systems interruption that affected our customer ordering, distribution, and manufacturing processes, and we have been adversely impacted by, and may continue to be adversely impacted by, the global COVID-19 pandemic and the responses of governments and of our partners, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and other businesses. Furthermore, any failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers could result in quality or safety issues.\nIn addition, many of our products require sterilization before sale and several of our key products are manufactured or sterilized at a particular facility, with limited alternate facilities. If an event occurs that results in damage to or closure of one or more of such facilities, such as the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in September 2017 or Illinois Environmental Protection Agency's decision to close a supplier's sterilization facility in February 2019, we may be unable to manufacture or sterilize the relevant products to the required quality specifications or at all. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing or sterilization facility, a third-party may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing or sterilization capacity is lost.\nOur research and development efforts rely upon investments and investment collaborations, and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful.\nOur mission is to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients to fuller, healthier lives, which requires a wide variety of technologies, products and capabilities. The rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions. In addition to internally generated growth through our research and development efforts, historically we have relied, and expect to continue to rely, upon investments and investment collaborations to provide us access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas.\nWe expect to make future investments where we believe that we can stimulate the development or acquisition of new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses. Investments and investment collaborations in and with medical technology companies are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe continuing development of many of our products depends upon us maintaining strong relationships with healthcare professionals.\nIf we fail to maintain our working relationships with healthcare professionals, many of our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products, which could cause a decline in our earnings and profitability. The research, development, marketing and sales of many of our new and improved products depends on our maintaining working relationships with healthcare professionals. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development, marketing and sale of our products. Physicians assist us as researchers, marketing and product consultants, inventors and public speakers. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our access to these professionals has been limited at times, and travel restrictions, shutdowns and\n17\nsimilar measures have impacted our ability to maintain these relationships, thereby affecting our ability to develop, market and sell new and improved products. If we are unable to maintain strong relationships with these professionals, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business.\nAt April 30, 2021, we had approximately $26.4 billion of debt, of which all is noncurrent except $11.0 million. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:\n•\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations,\n•\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions, and placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged,\n•\nlimiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate,\n•\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes, and\n•\nexposing us to greater interest rate risk since the interest rate on floating rate borrowings is variable.\nOur debt service obligations require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion of our business, acquisitions, and ongoing capital expenditures, which could impede our growth. If our operating cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional equity or debt financing or restructure our debt, which could harm our long-term business prospects. Our failure to comply with the terms of our revolving credit facility and other indebtedness could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt.\nFailure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully, as well as liabilities or claims relating to such acquired businesses, could adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our strategy to develop and identify new products and technologies, we have made several significant acquisitions in recent years, and may make additional acquisitions in the future. Our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, manufacturing, and finance. These efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management’s time that cannot then be dedicated to other projects. Our failure to manage and coordinate the growth of acquired companies successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business. Further, acquired businesses may have liabilities, or be subject to claims, litigation or investigations that we did not anticipate or which exceed our estimates at the time of the acquisition. In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so. Factors that will affect the success of our acquisitions include:\n•\nthe presence or absence of adequate internal controls and/or significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies,\n•\nour ability or inability to integrate information technology systems of acquired companies in a secure and reliable manner,\n•\nliabilities, claims, litigation, investigations, or other adverse developments relating to acquired businesses or the business practices of acquired companies, including investigations by governmental entities, potential FCPA or product liability claims or other unanticipated liabilities,\n•\nany decrease in customer loyalty and product orders caused by dissatisfaction with the combined companies’ product lines and sales and marketing practices, including price increases,\n•\nour ability to retain key employees, and\n•\nthe ability to achieve synergies among acquired companies, such as increasing sales of the integrated company’s products, achieving cost savings, and effectively combining technologies to develop new products.\nWe also could experience negative effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows from acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges. These effects, individually or in the aggregate, could cause a deterioration of our credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.\n18\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our future operations from natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires or flooding. Such extreme weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt operation of our supply chain and may impact operational costs. The impacts of climate change on global water resources may result in water scarcity, which could in the future impact our ability to access sufficient quantities of water in certain locations and result in increased costs. Concern over climate change could result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements, we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations and may adversely affect raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products.\nWe are subject to extensive and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nOur medical devices and technologies, as well as our business activities, are subject to a complex set of regulations and rigorous enforcement, including by the U.S. FDA, U.S. Department of Justice, Health and Human Services-Office of the Inspector General, and numerous other federal, state, and non-U.S. governmental authorities. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products. As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations, and trial endpoints. Unfavorable clinical data from existing or future clinical trials may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate, and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products, and the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Even if we are able to obtain approval or clearance, it may:\n•\ntake a significant amount of time,\n•\nrequire the expenditure of substantial resources,\n•\ninvolve stringent clinical and pre-clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance,\n•\ninvolve modifications, repairs or replacements of our products, and\n•\nlimit the proposed uses of our products.\nBoth before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under the U.S. FDA and other applicable non-U.S. government agency regulations. For instance, many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the U.S. FDA to determine compliance with applicable regulations. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on the U.S. FDA’s Form-483, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such medical products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending pre-market approval applications or require certificates of non-U.S governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA and other non-U.S. government agencies may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future pre-market clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Furthermore, we occasionally receive subpoenas or other requests for information from state and federal governmental agencies, and while these investigations typically relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers, regulatory compliance and product promotional practices, we cannot predict the timing, outcome or impact of any such investigations. Any adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil and/or criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties, and/or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs and/or entry into Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIAs) with governmental agencies. In addition, resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional, costly compliance obligations. These potential consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from government investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n19\nIn addition, the U.S. FDA has taken the position that device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling, and any failure to comply could subject us to significant civil or criminal exposure, administrative obligations and costs, and/or other potential penalties from, and/or agreements with, the federal government.\nGovernmental regulations outside the U.S. have, and may continue to, become increasingly stringent and common. In the European Union, for example, a new Medical Device Regulation which became effective in May 2021, includes significant additional premarket and post-market requirements. Penalties for regulatory non-compliance could be severe, including fines and revocation or suspension of a company’s business license, mandatory price reductions and criminal sanctions. Future laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of healthcare goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur devices, products and therapies are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians that typically bill various third-party payers, such as governmental healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable non-U.S. programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payers is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. As a result, our devices, products and therapies are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by HHS, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health are goods and services, including laws and regulations related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and healthcare fraud. Many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state Medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payers. In certain circumstances, insurance companies attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for causing false claims. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-approved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties.\nWe are also subject to risks relating to changes in government and private medical reimbursement programs and policies, and changes in legal regulatory requirements in the U.S. and around the world. Implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to these reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to coverage of or reimbursement for our products by administrators of these systems, could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.\nWe are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impacting our ability to sell current or future products.\nWe are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets, and agreements (such as employee, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements) to protect our business and proprietary intellectual property. We also operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. Patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products. At any given time, we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation, it is possible that the results of such litigation could require us to pay significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or that enforcement actions to protect our patent and proprietary rights against others could be unsuccessful, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWhile we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, our patents, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets or agreements (such as employee, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements) may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Further, pending patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or too limited in scope to protect our technology or provide us with any competitive advantage. Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. We also rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with certain employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.\n20\nIn addition, the laws of certain countries in which we market or manufacture some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position. Competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that substantially mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nQuality problems and product liability claims could lead to recalls or safety alerts, reputational harm, adverse verdicts or costly settlements, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nQuality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the impact on patients, and the serious and potentially costly consequences of product failure. Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical devices. In addition, many of our products are often used in intensive care settings with seriously ill patients and some of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. Component failures, manufacturing nonconformances, design defects, off-label use, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information with respect to our products, if they were to occur, could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient. These problems could lead to recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products, and could result in product liability claims and lawsuits, including class actions, which could ultimately result, in certain cases, in the removal from the body of such products and claims regarding costs associated therewith. Due to the strong name recognition of the Medtronic and Covidien brands, a material adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand, and could harm our reputation and ability to market products in the future. Further, we may be exposed to additional potential product liability risks related to products designed, manufactured and/or marketed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and unpredictable or accelerated changes in demand for certain of our products in connection with COVID-19 and its related impacts could impact development and production of products and services and could increase the risk of regulatory enforcement actions, product defects or related claims, as well as adversely impact our customer relationships and reputation.\nStrong product quality is critical to the success of our goods and services. If we fall short of these standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers and our revenue and results of operations could decline. Our success also can depend on our ability to manufacture to exact specification precision-engineered components, subassemblies and finished devices from multiple materials. If our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards, our reputation, competitive advantage and market share could be harmed. In certain situations, we may undertake a voluntary recall of products or temporarily shut down production lines based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data.\nAny of the foregoing problems, including future product liability claims or recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nHealthcare policy changes may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn response to perceived increases in healthcare costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be proposals by several governments, regulators and third-party payers globally, including the U.S. federal and state governments, to control these costs and, more generally, to reform healthcare systems. Certain of these proposals could, among other things, limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses.\nWe have elected to self-insure most of our insurable risks across the Company, and we made this decision based on cost and availability factors in the insurance marketplace. We manage and maintain a portion of our self-insured program through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. We continue to maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy with third-party insurers that provides coverage for the directors and officers of the Company. We continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future. Although we believe, based on historical loss trends, that our self-insurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses, historical trends may not be indicative of future losses. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for other categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n21\nThe failure to comply with anti-corruption laws could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and/or criminal sanctions.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the Irish Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018, and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-administered healthcare systems in many jurisdictions around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such laws. We also participate in public-private partnerships and other commercial and policy arrangements with governments around the globe.\nGlobal enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased in recent years, including investigations and enforcement proceedings leading to assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals. Our international operations create a risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors. We maintain policies and programs to implement safeguards to educate our employees and agents on these legal requirements, and to prevent and prohibit improper practices. However, existing safeguards and any future improvements may not always be effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible. In addition, regulators could seek to hold us liable for conduct committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. Any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, including exclusion from government contracting, and could disrupt our business, adversely affect our reputation and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nLaws and regulations governing international business operations could adversely impact our business.\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the U.S. Department of Commerce (BIS), administer certain laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, in conducting activities, transacting business with or making investments in certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. economic sanctions. Our international operations subject us to these laws and regulations, which are complex, restrict our business dealings with certain countries, governments, entities, and individuals, and are constantly changing. Further restrictions may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations.\nFrom time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions, including Iran, Sudan, Syria, Cuba and the region of Crimea. Certain of our subsidiaries sell medical devices, and may provide related services, to distributors and other purchasing bodies in such countries. These business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income, but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations. Violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities, violations and litigation.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the health and safety of our employees, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials, emissions or discharges of substances into the environment, investigation and remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites, chemical constituents in medical products and end-of-life disposal and take-back programs for medical devices. Our operations and those of certain third-party suppliers involve the use of substances subject to these laws and regulations, primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes. If we or our suppliers violate these environmental laws and regulations, facilities could be shut down and violators could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned. Furthermore, environmental laws outside of the U.S. are becoming more stringent, resulting in increased costs and compliance burdens.\nIn addition, certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances or materials at their properties or at properties which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash outflows is difficult to predict, given the uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.\n22\nThe costs of complying with current or future environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, or liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances, may exceed our estimates, or have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe rely on the proper function, security and availability of our information technology systems and data, as well as those of third parties throughout our global supply chain, to operate our business, and a breach, cyber-attack or other disruption to these systems or data could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation or competitive position.\nWe are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business. That technology includes systems that could be used to process, transmit and store sensitive data. Additionally, many of our products and services include integrated software and information technology that collects data regarding patients or connects to other internal systems. Like all organizations, we routinely experience attempted interference with the integrity of, and interruptions in, our technology systems via events such as cyber-attacks, malicious intrusions, or other breakdowns. The consequences could mean data breaches, interference with the integrity of our products and data, or other significant disruptions. Furthermore, we rely on third-party vendors to supply and/or support certain aspects of our information technology systems and resulting products. As we have seen with recent “Supply Chain Attacks,” these third-party systems could also become vulnerable to cyber-attack, malicious intrusions, breakdowns, interference or other significant disruptions, and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own systems. Lastly, we continue to grow in part through new business acquisitions and, as a result, may face risks associated with defects and vulnerabilities in their systems, or difficulties or other breakdowns or disruptions in connection with the integration of the acquisitions into our information technology systems.\nOur worldwide operations mean that we are subject to laws and regulations, including data protection and cybersecurity laws and regulations, in many jurisdictions. The variety of U.S. and international privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations impacting our operations are described in “Item 1. Business\" –\nOther Factors Impacting Our Operations\n–\nData Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations\n. For example, GDPR prefers that we manage personal data in the E.U. and may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue in the event of certain violations. Furthermore, there has been a developing trend of civil lawsuits and class actions relating to breaches of consumer data held by large companies or incidents arising from other cyber-attacks. Any data security breaches, cyber-attacks, malicious intrusions or significant disruptions could result in actions by regulatory bodies and/or civil litigation, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation or competitive position.\nIn addition, our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems. This enables us to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving legal and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information, changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems, and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services. There can be no assurance that our extensive efforts (including, but not limited to, consolidating, protecting, upgrading and expanding our systems and capabilities, continuing to build security into the design of our products, and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology) will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions continues to mandate that our employees work remotely, which could expose us to greater risks related to cybersecurity and our information technologies systems.\nIf our information technology systems, products or services or sensitive data are compromised, there are many consequences that could result. Consequences include, but are not limited to patients or employees could be exposed to financial or medical identity theft or suffer a loss of product functionality, losing existing customers or have difficulty attracting new customers, experiencing difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, be exposed to the loss or misuse of confidential information, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other healthcare professionals, suffer regulatory sanctions or penalties under federal laws, state laws, or the laws of other jurisdictions, experience increases in operating expenses or an impairment in our ability to conduct our operations, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach, product failure, information technology outages or disruptions, or suffer other adverse consequences including lawsuits or other legal action and damage to our reputation.\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income based taxes, in the U.S., Ireland, and various other jurisdictions in which we operate. The tax laws in the U.S., Ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business and our effective tax rate. For example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and\n23\nJobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), which resulted in a significant charge to tax expense during our fiscal year 2018 associated with U.S. taxation of accumulated foreign earnings as well as the requirement to revalue U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate. While the U.S. Treasury has issued a significant amount of guidance to date on the interpretation of the Tax Act, there remains regulations that have not yet been issued in final form. In addition, the Biden Administration has provided a framework for proposed U.S. tax law changes, which if enacted could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIn 2015, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published an action plan called Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) with the purpose of tackling perceived tax abuses, inconsistency between taxing authorities, and their respective approach to international tax matters. Thereafter, many taxing authorities have adopted the BEPS guidelines into their local laws. In addition, the European Union (EU) expanded upon these guidelines with their Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD 1 & 2) to be applied by all member states by 2020. In 2018, the OECD announced its intention to expand the scope of BEPS (BEPS 2.0) to provide a long-term solution to taxing right challenges arising from the global digital economy. The OECD expects to release the final agreed BEPS 2.0 guidelines in the summer of 2021. Jurisdictions would then need to enact legislation to adopt the guidelines into law. The proposals, as currently drafted, are categorized into two groups (commonly referred to as Pillars). Pillar One is focused on providing a mechanism for taxing rights more closely with market engagement; generally where people or consumers are located. Pillar Two is focused on establishing a global minimum tax and would apply when a country’s income tax rate is below a still-to-be determined, minimum tax rate. These proposals are wide ranging and could affect all multinational enterprises across all industries without regard to their level of engagement with the digital economy. The aggressive nature of the timeline set by the OECD may mean that all implications for business may not have been fully worked through or fully understood by the OECD before final guidelines are issued. We continue to monitor the implications potentially resulting from this guidance. This action together with other legislative changes in many countries on the mandatory sharing of company information (financial and operational) with taxing authorities on a local and global basis under various information sharing initiatives, could lead to disagreements between jurisdictions associated with the proper allocation of profits between such jurisdictions.\nWe are subject to ongoing tax audits in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe have recorded reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions. However, the calculation of such tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax laws, regulations and treaties (where applicable) in many jurisdictions. Therefore, any dispute with a tax authority may result in a payment that is significantly different from current estimates. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities generally would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the amount for which it is ultimately liable, we would incur additional charges, and such charges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nThe Medtronic, Inc. tax court proceeding outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nIn March 2009, the IRS issued its audit report for Medtronic Inc. for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreements with the IRS on some, but not all matters related to these fiscal years. The remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico, which is one of our key manufacturing sites. An adverse outcome in this matter could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFuture potential changes to the U.S. tax laws could result in us being treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and the IRS may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S federal income tax purposes.\nBecause Medtronic plc is organized under the laws of Ireland, we would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under the general rule that a corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Even so, the IRS may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In addition, a retroactive change to U.S. tax laws in this area could change this classification. If we were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for federal tax purposes, we could be subject to substantially greater U.S. tax liability than currently contemplated as a non-U.S. corporation.\n24\nLegislative or other governmental action relating to the denial of U.S. federal or state governmental contracts to U.S. companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business.\nVarious U.S. federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to U.S. companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect us. We are unable to predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of the regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation\nWe are incorporated in Ireland, and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.\nOur shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S. currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland.\nAs an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act 2014, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in the U.S.\nAs an Irish public limited company, certain capital structure decisions require shareholder approval, which may limit Medtronic’s flexibility to manage its capital structure.\nUnder Irish law, our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares, without shareholder approval, once authorized to do so by our articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders where shares are being issued for cash consideration but allows shareholders to disapply such statutory preemption rights either in our articles of association or by way of special resolution. Such disapplication can either be generally applicable or be in respect of a particular allotment of shares. Accordingly, at our 2020 Annual General Meeting, our Shareholders authorized our Board of Directors to issue up to 33% of our issued ordinary shares and further authorized our Board of Directors to issue up to 10% of such shares for cash without first offering them to our existing shareholders (provided that with respect to 5% of such shares, such allotment is to be used for the purposes of a specified capital investment). Both of these authorizations will expire on June 11, 2022, unless renewed by shareholders for a further period. We anticipate seeking new authorizations at our 2021 Annual General Meeting and in subsequent years. We cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved, which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our securities.\nA transfer of our shares, other than ones effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in the Depository Trust Company, may be subject to Irish stamp duty.\nTransfers of our shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the Depository Trust Company (DTC) will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. However, if a shareholder holds our shares directly rather than beneficially through DTC, any transfer of shares could be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired). Payment of Irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee. The potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of shares.\n25\nIn certain limited circumstances, dividends we pay may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax and dividends received by Irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to Irish income tax.\nIn certain limited circumstances, dividend withholding tax (currently at a rate of 25%) may arise in respect of dividends paid on our shares. A number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the U.S. and other specified countries that have a tax treaty with Ireland may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax.\nShareholders resident in the U.S. that hold their shares through DTC will not be subject to dividend withholding tax, provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the U.S. (and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by us). However, other shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax, which could adversely affect the price of their shares.\nShareholders entitled to an exemption from Irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from us will not be subject to Irish income tax in respect of those dividends unless they have some connection with Ireland other than their shareholding in our Company (for example, they are resident in Ireland). Shareholders who receive dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on those dividends.\nOur shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to Irish capital acquisitions tax.\nIrish capital acquisitions tax (CAT) could apply to a gift or inheritance of our shares irrespective of the place of residence, ordinary residence or domicile of the parties. This is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in Ireland. The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT. Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT. Children have a tax-free threshold of €335,000 in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents. Irish Revenue typically updates the amount of this tax-free threshold on an annual basis.\nEconomic and Industry Risks\nIf we experience decreasing prices for our goods and services and we are unable to reduce our expenses, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, decreasing prices for certain of our goods and services due to pricing pressure from managed care organizations and other third-party payers on our customers, increased market power of our customers as the medical device industry consolidates and increased competition among medical engineering and manufacturing services providers. If the prices for our goods and services decrease and we are unable to reduce our expenses, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks associated with global operations that could adversely affect our profitability and operating results.\nWe develop, manufacture, distribute and sell our products globally. We intend to continue to expand our operations and to pursue growth opportunities outside the U.S., especially in emerging markets. Operations in different countries including emerging markets could expose us to additional and greater risks and potential costs, including:\n•\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates,\n•\nhealthcare reform legislation,\n•\nthe need to comply with different regulatory regimes worldwide that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products,\n•\nlocal product preferences and product requirements,\n•\nlonger-term receivables than are typical in the U.S.,\n•\ntrade protection measures, tariffs and other border taxes, and import or export licensing requirements,\n•\nless intellectual property protection in some countries outside the U.S. than exists in the U.S.,\n•\ndifferent labor regulations and workforce instability,\n•\npolitical and economic instability,\n•\nthe expiration and non-renewal of foreign tax rulings and/or grants,\n•\npotentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws, and\n•\neconomic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations.\nThe ongoing global economic competition and trade tensions between the U.S. and China present risk to Medtronic. Although we have been able to mitigate some of the impact on Medtronic from increased duties imposed by both sides (through petitioning both governments for tariff exclusions and other mitigations), the risk remains of additional tariffs and other kinds of restrictions. Tariff exclusions awarded to Medtronic by the U.S. Government require annual renewal, and policies for granting exclusions could shift. The U.S. and China could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government\n26\nprocurement or technology export restrictions, which could affect Medtronic’s access to the markets. China comprises approximately eight percent of our total revenues.\nMore generally, several governments including the U.S. have raised the possibility of policies to induce “re-shoring” of supply chains, less reliance on imported supplies, and greater national production. Examples include potential “Buy America” requirements in the U.S. or U.S. withdrawal from the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA). If such steps triggered retaliation in other markets restricting access to foreign products in purchases by their government-owned healthcare systems, the result could be a significant impact on Medtronic.\nOther significant changes or disruptions to international trade arrangements, such as termination or modifications of other existing trade agreements or the final implementation of the “Brexit” agreement between the United Kingdom and European Union, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, a significant amount of our trade receivables are with national healthcare systems in many countries. Repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the political and financial stability of those countries. In light of these global economic fluctuations, we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customers. Failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, COVID-19, and the responses of business and governments to the pandemic, have at times resulted in reduced availability of air transport, port closures, increased border controls or closures, increased transportation costs and increased security threats to our supply chain, and countries may continue to close borders, impose prolonged quarantines, and further restrict travel and other activities. Our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of global operations.\nFinally, changes in currency exchange rates may impact the reported value of our revenues, expenses, and cash flows. We cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates, the impact of exchange rate changes, nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nMany healthcare industry companies, including healthcare systems, distributors, manufacturers, providers, and insurers, are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. Further, this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power, which they can use to negotiate price concessions. If we must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation, or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nHealthcare industry cost-containment measures could result in reduced sales of our medical devices and medical device components.\nMost of our customers, and the healthcare providers to whom our customers supply medical devices, rely on third-party payers, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which medical devices that incorporate components we manufacture or assemble are used. The continuing efforts of governmental authorities, insurance companies and other payers of healthcare costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payers. If third-party payer payment approval cannot be obtained by patients, sales of finished medical devices that include our components may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our components. The cost-containment measures that healthcare providers are instituting, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S., could harm our ability to operate profitably. For example, managed care organizations have successfully negotiated volume discounts for pharmaceuticals, and GPOs and IDNs have also concentrated purchasing decisions for some customers, which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device companies, including us."

    "text": "The Company’s ordinary shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “MDT.”\nThe following table provides information about the shares repurchased by the Company during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021:\nIn March 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $6.0 billion of the Company's ordinary shares. There is no specific time-period associated with these repurchase authorizations.\nOn June 23, 2021, there were approximately 23,394 shareholders of record of the Company’s ordinary shares. Ordinary cash dividends declared and paid totaled 58.0 cents per share for each quarter of fiscal year 2021 and 54.0 cents per share for each quarter of fiscal year 2020. On May 27, 2021, the Company announced an increase in Medtronic's cash dividends for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, raising the amount to $0.63.\n29\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return on Medtronic’s ordinary shares with the cumulative total shareholder return on the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index and the S&P 500 Health Care Equipment Index for the last five fiscal years. The graph assumes that $100 was invested at market close on April 29, 2016 in Medtronic’s ordinary shares, the S&P 500 Index, and the S&P 500 Health Care Equipment Index and that all dividends were reinvested.\nFor information on the Company's equity compensation plans, see \"Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Shareholder Matters\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIrish Restrictions on Import and Export of Capital\nExcept as indicated below, there are no restrictions on non-residents of Ireland dealing in Irish domestic securities, which includes ordinary shares of Irish companies. Except as indicated below, dividends and redemption proceeds also continue to be freely transferable to non-resident holders of such securities. The Financial Transfers Act, 1992 provides that the Irish Minister for Finance can make provision for the restriction of financial transfers between Ireland and other countries. For the purposes of this Act, “financial transfers” include all transfers which would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the E.U. if they had been made between Member States of the E.U. This Act has been used by the Minister for Finance to implement European Council Directives, which provide for the restriction of financial transfers to certain countries, organizations, and people including the Al-Qaeda network and the Taliban, Afghanistan, Belarus, Burma (Myanmar), Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Republic of Guinea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, Ukraine and Zimbabwe.\nAny transfer of, or payment in respect of, a share or interest in a share involving the government of any country that is currently the subject of United Nations sanctions, any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing, or by any person acting on behalf of the foregoing, may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into Irish law.\nIrish Taxes Applicable to U.S. Holders\nDividends paid by Medtronic will generally be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax (currently at a rate of 25 percent) unless an exemption applies.\n30\nDividends paid to U.S. residents will not be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax provided that:\n•\nin the case of a beneficial owner of Medtronic shares held in the Depository Trust Company (DTC), the address of the beneficial owner in the records of his or her broker is in the United States and this information is provided by the broker to the Company’s qualifying intermediary; or\n•\nin the case of a record owner, the record owner has provided to the Company’s transfer agent a valid U.S. Certification of Residence (Form 6166) or valid Irish Non-Resident Form V2.\nIrish income tax may also arise with respect to dividends paid on Medtronic’s ordinary shares. A U.S. resident who meets one of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax described above and who does not hold Medtronic shares through a branch or agency in Ireland through which a trade is carried on generally will not have any Irish income tax liability on a dividend paid by Medtronic. In addition, if a U.S. shareholder is subject to the dividend withholding tax, the withholding payment discharges any Irish income tax liability, provided the shareholder furnishes to the Irish Revenue authorities a statement of the dividend withholding tax imposed.\nWhile the U.S./Ireland Double Tax Treaty contains provisions regarding withholding, due to the wide scope of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax available under Irish domestic law, it would generally be unnecessary for a U.S. resident shareholder to rely on the treaty provisions."

    "text": "The following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nThe discussi\non focuses on our financial results for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021 (fiscal year 2021) and the fiscal year ended April 24, 2020 (fiscal year 2020). A discussion on our results of operations for fiscal year 2020 as compared the year ended April 26, 2019 (fiscal year 2019) is included in Part II, Item 7. \"Mana\ngement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 24, 2020, filed with the SEC on June 19, 2020, and is incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K\n. You should read this discussion and analysis along with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020 and for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, which are presented within \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Amounts reported in millions within this annual report are computed based on the amounts in thousands, and therefore, the sum of the components may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. Additionally, certain columns and rows within tables may not sum due to rounding.\nThroughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we present certain financial measures that we use to evaluate the operational performance of the Company and as a basis for strategic planning; however, such financial measures are not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). These financial measures are considered \"non-GAAP financial measures\" and are intended to supplement, and should not be considered as superior to, financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We generally use non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's review of the operational performance of the Company and as a basis for strategic planning. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the Company's underlying operational performance and trends and may facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the medical technologies industry.\nAs presented in the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations section below, our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain charges or benefits that contribute to or reduce earnings and that may affect financial trends, and include certain charges or benefits that result from transactions or events that we believe may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact to our operations in future periods (Non-GAAP Adjustments).\nIn the event there is a Non-GAAP Adjustment recognized in our operating results, the tax cost or benefit attributable to that item is separately calculated and reported. Because the effective rate can be significantly impacted by the Non-GAAP Adjustments that take place during the period, we often refer to our tax rate using both the effective rate and the non-GAAP nominal tax rate (Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate). The Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate is calculated as the income tax provision, adjusted for the impact of Non-GAAP Adjustments, as a percentage of income before income taxes, excluding Non-GAAP Adjustments.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by subtracting property, plant, and equipment additions from operating cash flows.\nRefer to the “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations,\" \"Income Taxes,\" and \"Free Cash Flow\" sections for reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nEXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW\nThe global healthcare system faces an unprecedented challenge as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. COVID-19 had an adverse impact on certain aspects of our Company and business, including the demand for and supply of certain of our products, operations, supply chains and distribution systems, impacts or delays to product development milestones, clinical trials, or regulatory clearances and approval timing. Most of our businesses were affected by a decline in procedural volumes as a result of COVID-19 largely during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and the first two quarters of fiscal year 2021. However, we have seen a recovery in most of our businesses during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2021 from the depths of the pandemic that we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020.\nWe expect medical procedure recovery rates to continue to vary by therapy and country and could be impacted by regional COVID-19 case volumes, vaccine immunization rates, and new COVID-19 variants. As a result, we cannot predict with confidence the duration of the pandemic or the impact it may have on our Company.\n32\nThe following is a summary of revenue, diluted earnings per share, and cash flow for fiscal years 2021 and 2020:\nNon-GAAP Reconciliations\nThe tables below present reconciliations of our Non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for fiscal years 2021 and 2020:\n33\n(1)\nAssociated costs include costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses.\n(2)\nThe charges primarily include business combination transaction-related costs, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, and a change in amounts accrued for certain contingent liabilities for recent acquisitions.\n(3)\nWe exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on our minority investments as we do not believe these components of income or expense have a direct correlation to our ongoing or future business operations.\n(4)\nThe charges represent acquired IPR&D in connection with asset acquisitions and certain license payments for unapproved technology.\n(5)\nThe charges relate to the abandonment of certain intangible assets in our Neuroscience segment.\n(6)\nThe charges represent estimated incremental costs of complying with the new European Union medical device regulations for previously registered products and primarily include charges for contractors supporting the project and other direct third-party expenses.\n(7)\nThe charges relate to the early redemption of approximately $6.0 billion of debt.\n(8)\nThe net benefit primarily relates to the finalization of an audit at the IRS Appellate level for fiscal years 2012 through 2014 and the capitalization of certain research and development costs for U.S. income tax purposes, which are partially offset by the impact of an intercompany sale of assets, and a tax basis adjustment and amortization of previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions.\n(9)\nThe charges primarily include costs incurred in connection with legacy-Covidien enterprise resource planning deployment activities, business combination related costs, and changes in fair value of contingent consideration.\n(10)\nThe charges, which include $413 million recognized in\ninterest expense\nand ($7 million) recognized in\nother operating expense, net\n, primarily relates to the early redemption of approximately $5.2 billion of debt.\n(11)\nThe net charges relate to the exit of businesses and are primarily comprised of intangible asset impairments.\n(12)\nThe net benefit primarily relates to the release of a valuation allowance on certain net operating losses, the impact of an intercompany sale of intellectual property, and the impact of tax reform in Switzerland and the United States.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by subtracting additions to property, plant, and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating results. Free cash flow should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations between net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) and free cash flow are as follows:\n34\nNET SALES\nSegment and Division\nThe charts below illustrate the percent of net sales by segment for fiscal years 2021 and 2020:\nThe table below includes net sales by segment and division for fiscal years 2021 and 2020:\n35\nSegment and Market Geography\nThe charts below illustrate the percent of net sales by market geography for fiscal years 2021 and 2020:\nThe table below includes net sales by market geography for each of our segments for fiscal years 2021 and 2020:\n(1)\nU.S. includes the United States and U.S. territories.\n(2)\nNon-U.S. developed markets include Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Canada, and the countries within Western Europe.\n(3)\nEmerging markets include the countries of the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the countries of Asia that are not included in the non-U.S. developed markets, as defined above.\nThe increase in net sales for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily related to the recovery of procedure volumes as compared to the drastic decline experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 as a result of the pandemic. While the recovery of procedural volumes has been uneven across geographies and our different product lines, as of the end of fiscal year 2021, procedural volumes in the majority of our end markets are returning to pre-pandemic levels. Net sales for fiscal year 2021 were also impacted by an additional selling week during the first fiscal month of fiscal year 2021 due to our 52/53 week fiscal year calendar. Although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of the extra selling week, we estimate that it benefited net sales for fiscal year 2021 by approximately $360 million to $390 million. Additionally, currency had a favorable impact on net sales in non-U.S. developed markets of $427 million and an unfavorable impact on net sales in emerging markets of $98 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020.\nDuring the first and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2021, we realigned our divisions with Neuroscience and Cardiovascular, respectively. As a result, fiscal year 2020 results have been recast to adjust for these realignments. Additionally, we implemented our new operating model in fiscal year 2021, which was fully operational beginning in the fourth quarter. Our new operating model simplifies our organization in order to accelerate decision making, improve commercial execution, and more effectively leverage the scale of our company. The \"Restructuring Charges, Net\" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis has further information regarding our new operating model.\n36\nLooking ahead, the uncertain and uneven global recovery from COVID-19 and the resulting impact on future procedural volumes and demand for our products and therapies could negatively impact our business. Additionally, our segments are likely to face competitive product launches and pricing pressure, geographic macro-economic risks, reimbursement challenges, impacts from changes in the mix of our product offerings, changes in timing of product registration approvals, replacement cycle challenges, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nCardiovascular\nCardiovascular products include pacemakers, insertable cardiac monitors, cardiac resynchronization therapy devices (CRT-D & CRT-P), implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), leads and delivery systems, ventricular assist systems, ablation products, electrophysiology catheters, products for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, information systems for the management of patients with Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure devices, products designed to reduce surgical site infections, coronary and peripheral stents and related delivery systems, balloons and related delivery systems, endovascular stent graft systems, heart valve replacement technologies, cardiac tissue ablation systems, and open heart and coronary bypass grafting surgical products. Cardiovascular also includes Care Management Services and Cath Lab Managed Services (CLMS) within the Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure division. Cardiovascular net sales for fiscal year 2021 were $10.8 billion, an increase of 3 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020. Currency had a favorable impact on net sales for fiscal year 2021 of $131 million. Cardiovascular net sales increase for fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020, was primarily due to the recovery of global procedural volumes from the downturn experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 resulting from the pandemic.\nThe charts below illustrate the percent of Cardiovascular net sales by division for fiscal years 2021 and 2020:\nCardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF) net sales increased 9 percent in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020. The increase was led by Cardiac Rhythm Management and Cardiac Ablation Solutions products, which included strong growth from the Micra leadless pacing system, Cobalt and Crome ICDs and CRT-Ds, TYRX antibacterial envelope, and Artic Front Advance Cryoballons. Partially offsetting this growth were declines in Mechanical Circulatory Support products driven by slower recovery of procedure volumes and competitive dynamics.\nStructural Heart & Aortic (SHA) net sales were flat in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 as growth in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) nets sales were offset by net sales declines within our Aortic and Cardiac Surgery businesses. The growth experienced in TAVR was driven by continued adoption of the Evolut Pro + valve. The declines experienced in Aortic and Cardiac Surgery were a result of slower recovery of procedure volumes as well our voluntary recall of the Valiant Navion Thoracic Stent Graft System in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nCoronary & Peripheral Vascular (CPV) net sales decreased 5 percent in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020. The decline was a result of the generally more deferrable nature of peripheral and endovenous procedure categories as well as the negative impact of the Chinese national tender on our drug-eluting stent sales. The Chinese national tender went into effect in January 2021 and resulted in significant price declines for drug-eluting stents in China, which negatively impacted our Coronary business. Partially offsetting these negative impacts was growth in drug-coated balloons and peripheral embolization\n37\ncoils. Drug-coated balloon growth was the result of strong adoption of the IN.PACT AV drug-coated balloon driven by its pivotal data published during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nIn addition to the general impacts of COVID-19 on our Company as described in the Executive Level Overview, looking ahead, we expect Cardiovascular could be affected by the following:\n•\nContinued growth of our Micra transcatheter pacing system. Micra AV received U.S. FDA approval and CE Mark approval in January and April 2020, respectfully. Micra AV expands the Micra target population from 15 percent to 45 percent of pacemaker patients.\n•\nContinued acceptance and growth from the Azure XT and S SureScan pacing systems. Azure pacemakers feature Medtronic-exclusive BlueSync technology, which enables automatic, secure wireless remote monitoring with increased device longevity.\n•\nAcceptance and growth of the Cobalt and Crome portfolio of ICDs and CRT-Ds. These devices received CE Mark approval during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and U.S. FDA approval during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.\n•\nContinued acceptance and growth of the Claria MRI CRT-D system with EffectivCRT Diagnostic and Effective CRT during AF algorithm.\n•\nAcceptance and growth of the LINQ II cardiac monitor, which received CE Mark in November 2019 and gained U.S. FDA approval during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. As of the end of the fiscal year 2021, we are experiencing supply constrains for the LINQ II cardiac monitor as we ramp our wafer scale manufacturing.\n•\nContinued acceptance and growth of the CRT-P quadripolar pacing system.\n•\nContinued growth, adoption, and utilization of the TYRX Envelope for implantable devices driven by the favorable results of the WRAP-IT clinical study. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we received 12-month shelf life extension for our TYRX Envelope product.\n•\nContinued acceptance and market expansion of the Arctic Front Advance Cryoballoon for treatment of atrial fibrillation. We are pursuing a first line therapy designation from the U.S. FDA for the Arctic Front Advance Cryoballoon's treatment of atrial fibrillation using the data of the STOP AF First clinical trial.\n•\nContinued acceptance and growth of the self-expanding CoreValve Evolut transcatheter aortic valve replacement platform into intermediate risk indication globally and for the treatment of patients determined to be at low risk with surgery. The Platform received both CE Mark for low risk and bicuspid labeling indication in Europe during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. In August 2020, the U.S. FDA approved revised commercial labeling for the platform that modified a precaution for the treatment of patients at low risk.\n•\nContinued expansion and training of field support to increase coverage in the U.S. centers performing transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedures.\n•\nContinued acceptance and growth from Evolut PRO, which provides industry-leading hemodynamics, reliable delivery, and advanced sealing with an excellent safety profile, as well as acceptance of our next generation Evolut Pro Plus TAVR valve.\n•\nThe negative impact of the Chinese national tender on drug-eluting stent prices in China, that went into effect in January 2021, as well as provincial tenders in China on other Coronary product categories.\n•\nContinued acceptance and growth from the VenaSeal Closure System in the U.S. The VenaSeal Closure System is a unique non-thermal solution to address superficial venous disease that provides improved patient comfort, reduces the recovery time, and eliminates the risk of thermal nerve injury.\n•\nOur voluntary recall of the Valiant Navion Thoracic Stent Graft System and our ability to ramp production of our previous generation product, the Valiant Captivia Thoracic Stent Graft System and resume selling this product in markets globally. We currently have limited Valiant Captivia inventory available and plan to reach full production capacity in October 2021.\n38\n•\nOur recent decision to stop the distribution and sale of the Medtronic HVAD System in June 2021 in light of a growing body of observational clinical comparisons indicating a lower frequency of neurological adverse events and mortality with another circulatory support device available to patients compared to the HVAD system. The HVAD system and associated accessory revenue was $141 million in fiscal year 2021. Medtronic is committed to serving the needs of the approximately 4,000 patients currently implanted with our HVAD system. We expect to record a non-cash, pre-tax impairment of long-lived assets of $400 million to $500 million in the quarter ending July 30, 2021 primarily related to intangible assets. Management also expects to record a charge related to customer support obligations, restructuring, and other associated costs in the quarter ending July 30, 2021.\n•\nOur ability to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval of products within our pipeline, which include the Symplicity Spyral Multi-Electrode Renal Denervation Catheter for the treatment of hypertension through a one-time, minimally invasive, catheter procedure, Pulse Field Ablation, a novel energy source that is non-thermal, for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, and transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapy products lead by our Intrepid system.\nMedical Surgical\nMedical Surgical’s products span the entire continuum of patient care from diagnosis to recovery, with a focus on diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, pelvic region, kidneys, obesity, and preventable complications. The products include those for advanced and general surgical products, surgical stapling devices, vessel sealing instruments, wound closure, electrosurgery products, hernia mechanical devices, mesh implants, advanced ablation, interventional lung, ventilators, airway products, renal care products, and sensors and monitors for pulse oximetry, capnography, level of consciousness and cerebral oximetry. Medical Surgical’s net sales for fiscal year 2021 were $8.7 billion, an increase of 5 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020. Currency had a favorable impact on net sales of $87 million for fiscal year 2021. Net sales growth was primarily driven by the recovery in procedure volumes experienced from the downturn experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 from the pandemic and increased demand for COVID-19 related diagnostics and therapies, particularly ventilator and airway products, as compared to fiscal year 2020.\nThe charts below illustrate the percent of Medical Surgical net sales by division for fiscal years 2021 and 2020:\nSurgical Innovations (SI) net sales for fiscal year 2021 decreased 1 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020, with declines experienced across many product lines due to the deceleration of surgical procedure recovery. The decline in surgical volumes, particularly Bariatric, Colorectal, Hernia, and Thoracic procedures, resulted in lower demand for Advanced Stapling products and General Surgery products. This decline in demand was partially offset by new product launches driving growth in Advanced Energy.\n39\nRespiratory, Gastrointestinal, & Renal (RGR) net sales for fiscal year 2021 increased 16 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020. Net sales growth was primarily attributable to increased demand for Respiratory Interventions products due to COVID-19, driven by the Puritan Bennett high acuity ventilator portfolio.\nIn addition to the general impacts of COVID-19 on our Company as described in the Executive Level Overview, looking ahead we expect Medical Surgical could be affected by the following:\n•\nContinued acceptance and future growth of Open-to-MIS techniques and tools supported by our efforts to transition open surgery to MIS (minimally invasive surgery). The Open-to-MIS initiative focuses on furthering our presence in and working to optimize open surgery globally, while capturing the market opportunity that exists in transitioning open procedures to MIS, whether through traditional MIS, or advanced technologies including robotics.\n•\nContinued acceptance and future growth of powered stapling and energy platform, along with our ability to execute ongoing strategies to develop, gain regulatory approval, and commercialize new products including our surgical soft tissue robotics platform.\n•\nOur ability to execute ongoing strategies in order to address the competitive pressure of reprocessing of our vessel sealing disposables and growth of surgical soft tissue robotics procedures in the U.S.\n•\nOur ability to create markets and drive products and procedures into emerging markets. We have high quality and cost-effective surgical products designed for customers in emerging markets such as the ValleyLab LS10 single channel vessel sealing generator, which is compatible with our line of LigaSure instruments and designed for simplified use and affordability.\n•\nContinued acceptance and growth within the end stage renal disease market. The population of patients treated for end stage renal disease globally is expected to double over the next decade.\n•\nContinued elevation of the standard of care for respiratory compromise, a progressive condition impacting a patient’s ability to breathe effectively, which leverages our market leading MicroStream capnography technology.\n•\nContinued acceptance and growth in patient monitoring, airway, and ventilation management. Key products in this area include the Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator, Microstream Capnography, Nellcor pulse oximetry system with OxiMax technology, Shiley tracheostomy and endotracheal tubes, and McGRATH MAC video laryngoscopes.\n•\nContinued and future acceptance of less invasive standards of care in Gastrointestinal and Hepatology products, including the areas of GI Diagnostic and Therapeutic product lines. Recently launched products include the PillCam COLON capsule endoscopy, the Barrx platform through ablation with the Barrx 360 Express catheter, EndoFLIP imaging systems, Bravo Calibration-free reflux testing, and the Emprint ablation system with Thermosphere Technology, which maintains predictable spherical ablation zones throughout procedures reducing procedure time and cost.\n•\nContinued and future acceptance of Interventional Lung Solutions. Products include our Illumisite navigation platform, combined with our portfolio of biopsy tools including the Arcpoint pulmonary needle, and to access lesions outside the airway, the CrossCountry transbronchial access tool. This comprehensive portfolio gives the power to display position and access lung nodules in the periphery of the lungs, in a minimally invasive approach to accessing difficult-to-reach areas of the lung, which may aid in the diagnosis of lung cancer.\n•\nExpanding the use of less invasive treatments and furthering our commitment to improving options for women with abnormal uterine bleeding. Our expanded and strengthened surgical offerings are expected to complement our global gynecology business.\n•\nOur ability to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval of products within our pipeline, which include our PillCam Genius endoscopy module, a noninvasive process to localize pre-cancerous lesions and our Hugo robotic assisted surgery system, designed to help reduce unwanted variability, improve patient outcomes, and, by extension, lower per-procedure cost.\n40\nNeuroscience\nNeuroscience's products include various spinal implants, bone graft substitutes, biologic products, image-guided surgery and intra-operative imaging systems, robotic guidance systems used in the robot-assisted spine procedures, and systems that incorporate advanced energy surgical instruments. Neuroscience's products also focus on the treatment of overactive bladder, urinary retention, fecal incontinence, gastroparesis, as well as products to treat ear, nose, and throat (ENT), and therapies to treat the diseases of the vasculature in and around the brain, including coils, neurovascular stents and flow diversion products. Neuroscience also manufactures products related to implantable neurostimulation therapies and drug delivery systems for the treatment of chronic pain, movement disorders, and epilepsy. Neuroscience’s net sales for fiscal year 2021 were $8.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020. Currency had a favorable impact on net sales for fiscal year 2021 of $75 million. Neuroscience’s net sales growth was observed across all divisions and reflected the recovery of global procedural volumes, particularly on deferrable procedures, from the downturn experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 as a result of the pandemic.\nThe graphs below illustrate the percent of Neuroscience net sales by division for fiscal years 2021 and 2020:\nCranial & Spinal Technologies (CST) net sales for fiscal year 2021 increased 5 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020. Growth was experienced by both Enabling Technologies and Spine. Enabling Technologies results, though still impacted by the challenging environment for capital equipment due to COVID-19, were driven by recovery on sales of the Midas Rex MR8 high-speed drill system and the StealthStation S8 Navigation System. Spine net sales growth was driven by recovery in procedural volumes in fiscal year 2021.\nSpecialty Therapies (Specialty) net sales for fiscal year 2021 increased 7 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020. Net sales growth was primarily driven by strength in Pelvic Health and Neurovascular. Pelvic Health saw continued recovery and growth throughout the fiscal year, driven by the launch of the InterStim Micro neurostimulator and SureScan MRI lead in the U.S. Neurovascular's growth continued to be driven by strength in coils and aspiration catheters, as well as general strength in emerging markets. This growth was partially offset by declines in flow diversion products due to recent competitive entrants. ENT experienced modest net sales growth due to the recovery of deferrable procedure volumes.\nNeuromodulation (NM) net sales for fiscal year 2021 increased 7 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020. Sales growth occurred in both Pain Therapies and Brain Modulation and reflected a recovery in procedural volumes. Net sales growth was driven by strong adoption of the DTM (differential target multiplexed) proprietary waveform in Pain Therapies, and the Percept PC deep brain stimulation (DBS) device with BrainSense technology in Brain Modulation.\n41\nIn addition to the general impacts of COVID-19 on our Company as described in the Executive Level Overview, looking ahead we expect Neuroscience could be affected by the following:\n•\nContinued growth from Enabling Technologies StealthStation and O-Arm Imaging Systems, Midas, and ENT Navigation and Power Systems, as well as acceptance of the Stealth Autoguide cranial robotic guidance platform.\n•\nContinued sales of Mazor robotic units and associated market adoption of robot-assisted spine procedures, including the Mazor X Stealth, our integrated robotics and navigation platform.\n•\nStrengthening of our position in the spine titanium interbody implant marketplace as a result of the June 2019 acquisition of Titan Spine.\n•\nContinued adoption of our integrated solutions through the Surgical Synergy strategy, which integrates our spinal implants with enabling technologies such as imaging, navigation, power instruments, nerve monitoring, and Mazor robotics.\n•\nMarket acceptance and continued global adoption of innovative new spine products and procedural solutions within our CST business such as our Infinity OCT System and Prestige LP cervical disc system.\n•\nGrowth in the broader vertebral compression fracture (VCF) and adjacent markets as we continue to pursue the development of other therapies to treat more patients with VCF, including continued success of both the Kyphon V vertebroplasty system and the Osteocool RF Spinal Tumor ablation system.\n•\nContinued acceptance and growth of our ENT and Pelvic Health therapies within our Specialty Therapies division, including our InterStim therapy with InterStim II and InterStim Micro neurostimulators, which received CE mark approval in January 2020 and U.S. FDA approval in August 2020, for the treatment of the symptoms of overactive bladder, urinary retention, and bowel incontinence, and capital equipment sales of the Stealth Station ENT surgical navigation system and intraoperative NIM nerve monitoring system.\n•\nContinued acceptance and growth of the Solitaire FR revascularization device for treatment of acute ischemic stroke and the Pipeline Embolization Devices, endovascular treatments for large or giant wide-necked brain aneurysms.\n•\nContinued acceptance of our React Catheter and Riptide aspiration system, along with our next-generation Solitaire revascularization device.\n•\nMarket acceptance and continued global adoption of our Intellis spinal cord stimulator, DTM proprietary waveform, Evolve workflow algorithm, and Snapshot reporting to treat chronic pain in major markets around the world.\n•\nContinued acceptance and growth of our Percept PC DBS device with BrainSense technology, which received CE Mark approval in January 2020 and U.S. FDA approval in June 2020, including its treatment of Parkinson's Disease, epilepsy, and other movement disorders.\n•\nOngoing obligations under the U.S. FDA consent decree entered in April 2015 relating to the SynchroMed drug infusion system and the Neuromodulation quality system. The U.S. FDA lifted its distribution requirements on our implantable drug pump in October 2017 and its warning letter in November 2017.\n•\nOur ability to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval of the products within our pipeline, which include our closed-loop Percept PC and RC devices with adaptive DBS (aDBS) within Neuromodulation, as well as our hemorrhagic stroke intrasaccular device within Specialty Therapies, and our next-generation spine enabling technologies within CST.\nDiabetes\nDiabetes' products include insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, insulin pump consumables, and smart insulin pen systems. Diabetes' sales for fiscal year 2021 were $2.4 billion, an increase of 2 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020. Currency had a favorable impact on net sales for fiscal year 2021 of $37 million. Diabetes' net sales increases for fiscal year 2021 were primarily attributable to growth in the MiniMed 780G insulin pump system and integrated CGM in the international markets. This growth was partially offset by declines in the U.S. due to new patient start delays and continued competitive pressures.\n42\nIn addition to the general impacts of COVID-19 on our Company as described in the Executive Level Overview, looking ahead we expect Diabetes could be affected by the following:\n•\nPatient demand for the MiniMed 770G insulin pump system, which received U.S. FDA approval in August 2020 and launched in November 2020. The system is powered by SmartGuard technology, as featured in the MiniMed 670G system, with the added benefits of smartphone connectivity and an expanded age indication to children as young as age two.\n•\nContinued future growth internationally for the MiniMed 780G system. The MiniMed 780G system was approved in the E.U. in June 2020 and launched in over 30 countries on four continents outside the U.S., primarily in Europe, starting in October 2020. The global adoption of sensor-augmented insulin pump systems has resulted in strong sensor attachment rates.\n•\nContinued acceptance and growth of the Guardian Connect CGM system, which displays glucose information directly to a smartphone. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we introduced the Guardian Connect system for Android devices to ensure patients have access to their glucose levels seamlessly and discretely. The Guardian Connect CGM system is available on Apple iOS and Android devices.\n•\nStrengthening our position in the diabetes market as a result of the September 10, 2020 acquisition of Companion Medical. Companion Medical offers a U.S. FDA cleared InPen smart pen system that combines the freedom of a reusable Bluetooth pen with the intelligence of an intuitive mobile application that helps users administer the appropriate insulin dose. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we integrated our CGM data into the Companion Medical InPen Application, which allows users to have their CGM readings in real-time alongside insulin dose information, all in one view.\n•\nContinued pump and CGM competition in an expanding global market.\n•\nChanges in medical reimbursement policies and programs, along with additional payor coverage on insulin pumps.\n•\nOur ability to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval of the products within our pipeline, which include our adult and pediatric MiniMed 780G and the Guardian 4 sensor, which have been submitted to the U.S. FDA. These technologies feature our next-generation algorithms by further automating insulin delivery.\n43\nCOSTS AND EXPENSES\nThe following is a summary of cost of products sold, research and development, and selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales:\nCost of Products Sold\nCost of products sold for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was $10.5 billion and $9.4 billion, respectively. The increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020, was largely due to increased expenses as a result of a full fiscal year impact of COVID-19, primarily due to period expensing of some of our fixed overhead costs due to idle capacity at certain manufacturing facilities and increases in reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, as well as charges associated with recent field corrective actions. Going forward, we will continue to focus on reducing our costs of production through supplier management, manufacturing improvements, and optimizing our manufacturing network.\nResearch and Development Expense\nWe remain committed to accelerating the development of meaningful innovations to deliver better patient outcomes at appropriate costs that lead to enhanced quality of life and may be validated by clinical and economic evidence. We are also focused on expanding access to quality healthcare.\nIn fiscal year 2021, we entered into arrangements with third parties to fund the development of certain technologies in our Diabetes segment. As there is a substantive and genuine transfer of risk to the third parties, the development funding provided is recognized as an obligation to perform contractual services, and therefore is recorded as income in\nother operating expense, net\nin the consolidated statements of income in the period the corresponding research and development expenses are incurred. If the technologies receive regulatory approval and are successfully commercialized, we will pay royalties to the third parties. During fiscal year 2021, no projects were significant, either individually or in aggregate, to our consolidated results.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expense\nOur goal is to continue to leverage selling, general, and administrative expense initiatives. Selling, general, and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and wages, other administrative costs, such as professional fees and marketing expenses, and certain acquisition and restructuring expenses.\nSelling, general, and administrative expense for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was $10.1 billion. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year 2021, as compared to 2020, was primarily due to net sales growth, coupled with reduced travel and discretionary spending due to the pandemic, offset by higher annual incentive accruals and increased restructuring and associated costs. Selling, general, and administrative expense in fiscal year 2021 includes $196 million of restructuring and associated costs, as compared to $168 million in fiscal year 2020. Additionally, for fiscal year 2020, selling, general, and administrative expense includes $103 million of acquisition-related costs, as compared to $3 million for fiscal year 2021.\n44\nThe following is a summary of other costs and expenses:\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets\nincludes the amortization expense of our definite-lived intangible assets, consisting of purchased patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, purchased technology, and other intangible assets.\nRestructuring Charges, Net\nEnterprise Excellence\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, we announced a multi-year global Enterprise Excellence Program designed to drive long-term business growth and sustainable efficiency. The Enterprise Excellence Program is expected to further leverage our global size and scale as well as enhance the customer and employee experience.\nThe Enterprise Excellence Program is focused on three objectives:\n•\nGlobal Operations – integrating and enhancing global manufacturing and supply processes, systems and site presence to improve quality, delivery cost and cash flow\n•\nFunctional Optimization – enhancing and leveraging global operating models and systems across several enabling functions to improve productivity and employee experience\n•\nCommercial Optimization – optimizing certain processes, systems and models to improve productivity and the customer experience\nThe Enterprise Excellence Program is designed to drive operating margin improvement as well as fund investment in strategic growth initiatives, with expected gross savings of more than $3.0 billion from cost reductions and leverage of our fixed infrastructure by the end of fiscal year 2022. Approximately $500 million to $700 million of gross annual savings are expected to be achieved through the end of fiscal year 2022.\nThe Enterprise Excellence Program is expected to result in pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, the vast majority of which are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2022 and result in cash outlays to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal year 2023. Approximately 40 percent of estimated charges are related to employee termination benefits. The remaining charges are costs associated with the restructuring program, such as salaries and benefits for employees supporting the program, including program management and transition teams, and strategic and operational consulting services related to the three objectives of the program discussed above. We expect these costs to be recognized within\nrestructuring charges, net, cost of products sold,\nand\nselling, general and administrative expense\nin the consolidated statements of income.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we recognized net charges of $349 million, including $52 million recognized within\nrestructuring charges, net\nin the consolidated statements of income which were primarily comprised of employee termination benefits. For fiscal year 2021, charges also included costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses, including $128 million recognized within\ncost of products sold\nand $169 million recognized within\nselling, general and administrative expense\nin the consolidated statements of income.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, we recognized net charges of $441 million, including $118 million recognized within\nrestructuring charges, net\nin the consolidated statements of income primarily comprised of employee termination benefits. For fiscal year 2020, charges also included costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses, including $149 million recognized within\ncost of products sold\nand $165 million recognized within\nselling, general and administrative expense\nin the consolidated statements of income.\n45\nSimplification\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we initiated our Simplification restructuring program, designed to make the Company a more nimble and competitive organization focused on accelerating innovation, enhancing the customer experience, driving revenue growth, and winning market share, while also more efficiently and effectively leveraging our enterprise scale. Under the oversight of the portfolio leaders, this new operating model, which became fully operational the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, will simplify our organizational structure and accelerate decision-making and execution. Primary activities of the restructuring program will include reorganizing our business into a portfolio-level structure, including the creation of highly focused, accountable and empowered Operating Units (OUs), consolidating operations at the enterprise level, establishing Technology Development Centers in areas where we have deep core technology competencies to be leveraged by multiple OUs, and forming dedicated sales organizations that leverage our scale but move with the same agility as our smaller, local competitors.\nThe Simplification program designed to streamline our operating model, improve competitiveness, and enhance the customer and employee experience will result in substantial reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses, the majority of which are expected to be achieved through the end of fiscal year 2022. Annual savings of approximately $450 million to $475 million are expected to be realized by the various components of the Simplification program.\nWe estimate that, in connection with the Simplification restructuring program, we will recognize pre-tax exit and disposal costs and other costs across all segments of approximately $400 million to $450 million, the majority of which are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2022. Approximately three quarters of the estimated charges are related to employee termination benefits. The remaining charges are costs associated with the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses to execute the reorganization of our business into a portfolio-like structure as discussed above. These charges are recognized within\nrestructuring charges, net\nand\nselling, general, and administrative expense\nin the consolidated statements of income.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we recognized net charges of $268 million, including $241 million within\nrestructuring charges, net\nin the consolidated statements of income. For fiscal year 2021, charges included $97 million of incremental defined benefit pension and post-retirement related expenses for employees that accepted voluntary early retirement packages within\nrestructuring charges, net\nin the consolidated statements of income. For fiscal year 2021, charges also included costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses, including $27 million recognized within\nselling, general, and administrative expense\nin the consolidated statements of income.\nFor additional information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCertain Litigation Charges\nWe classify litigation charges and gains related to significant legal matters as certain litigation charges. For additional information, refer to Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Operating Expense, Net\nOther operating expense, net primarily includes royalty income and expense, currency remeasurement and derivative gains and losses, Puerto Rico excise taxes, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, changes in amounts accrued for certain contingent liabilities for a recent acquisition, a commitment to the Medtronic Foundation, charges associated with business exits, impairment charges, in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges, and income from funded research and development arrangements.\nThe increase in other operating expense, net from fiscal year 2020 to 2021 was primarily driven by our remeasurement and hedging programs, which, combined, resulted in a loss of $47 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to a gain of $295 million for fiscal year 2020. Additionally, for fiscal year 2021, other operating expense, net includes a $132 million gain related to amounts accrued for certain contingent liabilities for a recent acquisition and impairment charges of $76 million related to the abandonment of certain intangible assets. Also contributing to the increase were changes in fair value of contingent consideration resulting in a loss of $36 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to a gain of $33 million for fiscal year 2020. For fiscal year 2020, other operating expense, net includes an $80 million charge associated with a commitment to the Medtronic Foundation and charges of $52 million associated with the exit of businesses.\nOther Non-Operating Income, Net\nOther non-operating income, net includes the non-service components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost, investment gains and losses, and interest income.\nThe decrease in other non-operating income, net from fiscal year 2020 to 2021 was primarily attributable to the decrease in interest income as a result of the lower interest rate environment. Interest income was $192 million and $300 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in gains recognized on minority investments. Gains on minority investments were $61 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to losses of $19 million for fiscal year 2020.\n46\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense includes interest incurred on our outstanding borrowings, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts, amortization of gains or losses on terminated or de-designated interest rate derivative instruments, and charges recognized in connection with the tender and early redemption of senior notes. The decrease in interest expense from fiscal year 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in charges related to debt tender and redemption transactions, which were $308 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $413 million for fiscal year 2020. Also contributing to the decrease was a decrease in the weighted-average interest rate of outstanding debt obligations due to the aforementioned debt issuance and tender transactions. Refer to the \"Debt and Capital\" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information on the debt issuances, tenders, and early redemptions.\nINCOME TAXES\nMany of the countries we operate in have statutory tax rates lower than our U.S. statutory rate, thereby resulting in an overall effective tax rate less than the U.S. statutory rate of 21.0 percent. A significant portion of our earnings are generated from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, and Ireland. The statutory tax rates for these jurisdictions range from 12.5 percent to 43.75 percent. Our earnings in Puerto Rico are subject to certain tax incentive grants which provide for tax rates lower than the country’s statutory tax rates. Unless our tax incentive grants are extended, they will expire between fiscal years 2022 and 2030. The tax incentive grants, which expired during fiscal year 2021, did not have a material impact on our financial results. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was 6.8 percent, as compared to (18.5) percent in fiscal year 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impacts from certain tax adjustments and year-over-year changes in operational results by jurisdiction.\nOur Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for fiscal year 2021 was 11.8 percent, as compared to 14.3 percent in fiscal year 2020. The decrease in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to the year-over-year changes in operational results by jurisdiction.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we recognized\n$51 million of operational tax benefits. The operational tax benefits included a $46 million benefit from excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation and a $5 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits, finalization of certain tax returns, changes to uncertain tax position reserves, legal entity reorganizations, and changes to certain deferred income tax balances.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, we recognized\n$138 million of operational tax benefits. The operational tax benefits included a $63 million benefit from excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation and a $75 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits, finalization of certain tax returns, changes to uncertain tax position reserves, and changes to certain deferred income tax balances.\nAn increase in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate of one percent would result in an additional income tax provision for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 of approximately\n$68 million and $73 million, respectively.\n47\nCertain Tax Adjustments\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the net benefit from certain tax adjustments of $41 million, recognized in\nincome tax provision (benefit)\nin the consolidated statement of income, included the following:\n•\nA net benefit of $106 million associated with the resolution of an audit at the IRS Appellate level for fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014. The issues resolved relate to the utilization of certain net operating losses and the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for businesses that are not the subject of the U.S. Tax Court Case for fiscal years 2005 and 2006.\n•\nA net cost of $73 million related to a tax basis adjustment of previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions. The cumulative amount of deferred tax benefit previously recognized from intercompany intellectual property transactions and recorded as Certain Tax Adjustments is $1.5 billion. The corresponding deferred tax assets will be amortized over a period of approximately 20 years.\n•\nA cost of $50 million associated with the amortization of the previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions.\n•\nA net cost of $25 million associated with an internal restructuring and intercompany sale of assets.\n•\nA benefit of $83 million related to the capitalization of certain research and development costs for U.S. income tax purposes and the establishment of a deferred tax asset at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the net benefit from certain tax adjustments of $1.2 billion, recognized in\nincome tax provision (benefit)\nin the consolidated statement of income, included the following:\n•\nA net benefit of $63 million related to the finalization of certain state tax impacts from U.S. Tax Reform, and the issuance of certain final U.S. Treasury Regulations associated with U.S. Tax Reform. The primary impact of these regulations resulted in the Company re-establishing its permanently reinvested assertion on certain foreign earnings and reversing the previously accrued tax liability. This benefit was partially offset by additional tax associated with a previously executed internal reorganization of certain foreign subsidiaries.\n•\nA benefit of $252 million related to tax legislative changes in Switzerland, which abolished certain preferential tax regimes the Company benefited from and replaced them with a new set of internationally accepted measures. The legislation provided for higher effective tax rates but allowed for a transitional period whereby an amortizable asset was created for Swiss federal income tax purposes that will be amortized and deducted over a 10-year period.\n•\nA benefit of $658 million related to the release of a valuation allowance previously recorded against certain net operating losses.\nLuxembourg enacted tax legislation during the year requiring the company to reassess the realizability of certain net operating losses.\nThe Company evaluated both the positive and negative evidence and released valuation allowance equal to the expected benefit from the utilization of certain net operating losses in connection with a planned intercompany sale of intellectual property.\n•\nA net benefit of $269 million associated with the intercompany sale of intellectual property and the establishment of a deferred tax asset.\nCertain tax adjustments will affect the comparability of our operating results between periods. Therefore, we consider these Non-GAAP Adjustments. Refer to the \"Executive Level Overview\" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion of these adjustments.\n48\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe are currently in a strong financial position, despite the impact COVID-19 had on our business and financial results during fiscal years 2021 and 2020. We believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility, and our cash, cash equivalents, and current investments, along with our credit facility and related commercial paper programs will satisfy our foreseeable operating needs.\nOur liquidity and capital structure are evaluated regularly within the context of our annual operating and strategic planning processes. We consider the liquidity necessary to fund our operations, which includes working capital needs, investments in research and development, property, plant, and equipment, and other operating costs. We also consider capital allocation alternatives that balance returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, satisfying maturing debt, and acquiring businesses and technology.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following is a summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents, and the net change in cash and cash equivalents:\nOperating Activities\nThe $994 million decrease in net cash provided was primarily driven by a decrease in cash collected from customers and an increase in cash paid for income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in cash paid to employees, a decrease in payments made for employer taxes, and a decrease in retirement benefit plan contributions. The decrease in cash collected from customers was primarily related to COVID-19 driving decreased sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and first quarter of fiscal year 2021, when compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in cash paid for income taxes was primarily due to increased estimated federal tax payments and tax payments associated with IRS audit settlements in fiscal year 2021. Cash paid to employees decreased due to lower annual incentive plan payouts compared the prior fiscal year. Payments made for employer taxes decreased due to the deferral of payment on the Company's share of Social Security taxes allowed by the CARES Act in the current fiscal year. For information on retirement benefit plan contributions, refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvesting Activities\nThe $337 million decrease in net cash used was primarily attributable to a decrease in net purchases of investments of $1.0 billion, partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $506 million as compared to fiscal year 2020.\nFinancing Activities\nThe $62 million decrease in net cash used included a number of largely offsetting items. Contributing to the decrease in cash used was a decrease in share repurchases of $674 million. Partially offsetting this decrease was a net decrease in short-term borrowings of $294 million and an increase in dividends paid to shareholders of $226 million. For fiscal year 2021, financing cash flows were impacted by the Mizuho Bank term loan under which we borrowed ¥300 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, which was subsequently repaid in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Fiscal year 2021 financing cash flows were also impacted by the issuance of $7.2 billion of Euro-denominated senior notes offset by the early redemption of $6.0 billion of senior notes for $6.3 billion of total consideration, and repayment of an additional $911 million of Euro-denominated senior notes. For comparison, financing cash flows for fiscal year 2020 reflect the issuance of $5.6 billion of Euro-denominated senior notes, offset by the tender of $5.2 billion of senior notes for $5.6 billion of total consideration. We also repaid $500 million of senior notes at maturity during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. For more information on the aforementioned Mizuho Bank term loan, and issuances and redemptions of senior notes, refer to the Debt and Capital section.\nDebt and Capital\nOur capital structure consists of equity and interest-bearing debt. We primarily utilize unsecured senior debt obligations to meet our financing needs and, to a lesser extent, bank borrowings. From time to time, we may repurchase our outstanding debt obligations in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.\n49\nTotal debt at April 30, 2021 was $26.4 billion, as compared to $24.8 billion at April 24, 2020. The increase in total debt was primarily driven by fluctuations in exchange rates as it pertains to our Euro-denominated senior notes and, to a lesser extent, the net impact of the issuance and redemption of senior notes, both of which are described below.\nIn September 2020, we issued six tranches of Euro-denominated senior notes with an aggregate principal of €6.3 billion, with maturities ranging from fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2051, resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $7.2 billion, net of discounts and issuance costs. The Euro-denominated debt is designated as a net investment hedge of certain of our European operations. We used the net proceeds of the offering to fund the early redemption of $6.0 billion of senior notes for $6.3 billion of total consideration in October 2020. Additionally, we used the proceeds to repay our €750 million floating rate senior notes at maturity in March 2021. We recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $308 million in fiscal year 2021, which primarily included cash premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums. The loss on debt extinguishment was recognized in\ninterest expense\nin the consolidated statements of income.\nIn May 2020, we entered into an unsecured term loan agreement with Mizuho Bank, Ltd. for an aggregate principal amount of up to ¥300 billion, or approximately $2.8 billion, with a term of six months and the option to extend for an additional six months. On May 13, 2020, Medtronic Luxco borrowed the entire amount of the term loan under the Loan Agreement. The proceeds of the loan were used for general corporate purposes. The Japanese Yen denominated debt was designated as a net investment hedge of certain of our Japanese operations. On November 12, 2020, we exercised our option to extend the term of the loan for an additional six months. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we de-designated the Yen denominated debt as a net investment hedge and repaid the term loan in full, including interest.\nWe repurchase our ordinary shares from time to time as part of our focus on returning value to our shareholders. In March 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $6.0 billion of the Company's ordinary shares. There is no specific time period associated with these repurchase authorizations. During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we repurchased a total of 4 million and 12 million shares, respectively, under these programs at an average price of $126.80 and $106.22, respectively. At April 30, 2021, we had approximately $5.4 billion remaining under the share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors.\nFor more information on credit arrangements, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity sources at April 30, 2021 include $3.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $7.2 billion of current investments.\nAdditionally, we maintain commercial paper programs (no commercial paper outstanding at April 30, 2021) and a Credit Facility.\nOur investments primarily include available-for-sale debt securities, including U.S. and non-U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, and other asset-backed securities. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our investments.\nWe maintain multicurrency commercial paper programs for short-term financing, which allows us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.5 billion. At both April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020, we had no commercial paper outstanding. The issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under our existing line of credit, as explained below.\nWe also have a $3.5 billion five-year syndicated credit facility (Credit Facility), which expires in December 2025. The Credit Facility provides backup funding for the commercial paper programs and may also be used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility provides us with the ability to increase our borrowing capacity by an additional $1.0 billion at any time during the term of the agreement. At each anniversary date of the Credit Facility, but not more than twice prior to the maturity date, we could also request a one-year extension of the maturity date. At April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020, no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Facility.\nInterest rates on advances of our Credit Facility are determined by a pricing matrix based on our long-term debt ratings assigned by Standard & Poor's Rating Services (S&P) and Moody's Investor Service (Moody’s). Facility fees are payable on the Credit Facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates. We are in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Facility.\n50\nThe following table is a summary of our S&P and Moody's long-term debt ratings and short-term debt ratings:\n(1)    Agency ratings are subject to change, and there is no assurance that an agency will continue to provide ratings and/or maintain its current ratings. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nS&P and Moody's long-term debt ratings and short-term debt ratings at April 30, 2021 were unchanged as compared to the ratings at April 24, 2020. We do not expect the S&P and Moody's ratings to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our balance sheet, Credit Facility, and related commercial paper programs.\n51\nContractual Obligations and Cash Requirements\nWe have future contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments that are entered into in the normal course of business, some of which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. We believe our off-balance sheet arrangements do not have a material current or anticipated future effect on our consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.\nPresented below is a summary of our off-balance sheet contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments at April 30, 2021, as well as long-term contractual obligations reflected in the balance sheet at April 30, 2021.\n(1)\nIncludes commitments related to the funding of minority investments, estimated milestone payments, and royalty obligations. While it is not certain if and/or when payments will be made, the maturity dates included in the table reflect our best estimates.\n(2)\nIncludes the contractual interest payments on our outstanding debt and excludes the impacts of debt premium and discount amortization. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our debt agreements.\n(3)\nIncludes inventory purchase commitments, research and development, and other arrangements that are legally binding and specify minimum purchase quantities or spending amounts. These purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business. Excludes open purchase orders with a remaining term of less than one year.\n(4)\nExcludes defined benefit plan obligations, guarantee obligations, uncertain tax positions, non-current tax liabilities, and litigation settlements for which we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement. For further information, see Notes 13, 15, and 18 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\n(5)\nIncludes the current and non-current portion of our Senior Notes and bank borrowings. Excludes debt premium and discount, unamortized gains from terminated interest rate swap agreements, and commercial paper. See Notes 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our debt agreements and interest rate swap agreements, respectively.\n(6)\nIncludes the fair value of our current and non-current portions of contingent consideration. While it is not certain if and/or when payments will be made, the maturity dates included in this table reflect our best estimates.\n(7)\nRepresents the tax obligations associated with the transition tax that resulted from U.S. Tax Reform. The transition tax will be paid over an eight-year period and will not accrue interest. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nIn the normal course of business, we periodically enter into agreements that require us to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising as a result of our products or the negligence of our personnel or claims alleging that our products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. Our maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions is unable to be estimated, and we have not accrued any liabilities within our consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in the table above. Historically, we have not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification agreements.\n52\nNote 18 to the consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides information regarding amounts we have accrued related to legal matters. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Actual settlements may be different than estimated and could have a material effect on our consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.\nWe record tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for amounts that we expect to repatriate from subsidiaries (to the extent the repatriation would be subject to tax); however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts we consider to be permanently reinvested. We expect to have access to the majority of our cash flows in the future. In addition, we continue to evaluate our legal entity structure supporting our business operations, and to the extent such evaluation results in a change to our overall business structure, we may be required to accrue for additional tax obligations.\nBeyond the contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments outlined above, we have recurring cash requirements arising from the normal operation of our business that include capital expenditures, research and developments costs, and other operational costs.\nWe believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility, and our cash, cash equivalents, current investments, Credit Facility and related commercial paper programs as well as our ability to generate operating cash flows will satisfy our current and future contractual obligations and cash requirements. We regularly review our capital needs and consider various investing and financing alternatives to support our requirements.\nACQUISITIONS\nInformation regarding acquisitions is included in Notes 3 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nWe have used various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates reflect our best judgment about economic and market conditions and the potential effects on the valuation and/or carrying value of assets and liabilities based upon relevant information available. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nOur critical accounting estimates include the following:\nLitigation Contingencies\nWe are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability, intellectual property and commercial disputes, shareholder related matters, environmental proceedings, tax disputes, and governmental proceedings and investigations. The outcomes of these legal actions are not completely within our control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages, as well as other civil or criminal remedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues or limit our ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions. Estimating probable losses from our litigation and governmental proceedings is inherently difficult, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice. Our significant legal proceedings are discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncome Tax Reserves\nWe establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail. Under U.S. GAAP, if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities. We reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit, or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit, when there is (i) a completion of a tax audit, (ii) effective settlement of an issue, (iii) a change\n53\nin applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance, or (iv) the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, consolidated earnings, financial position and/or cash flows.\nValuation of Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nWhen we acquire a business, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets primarily include patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, purchased technology, and IPR&D. Determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us to make significant estimates. These estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows of each project or technology, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value, the assessment of the asset’s life cycle, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks.\nThe test for goodwill impairment requires us to make several estimates to determine fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value. We assess the impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level annually as of the first day of the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.\nWe test definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may be impaired. Our tests are based on future cash flows that require significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates, appropriate discount rates, asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. We use estimates that are consistent with the highest and best use of the assets based on a market participant's view of the assets being evaluated. Actual results may differ from our estimates due to a number of factors including, among others, changes in competitive conditions, timing of regulatory approval, results of clinical trials, changes in worldwide economic conditions, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nWe assess the impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Our impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets require us to make several estimates to determine fair value, including projected future cash flows and discount rates.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n54\nSUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nMedtronic plc and Medtronic Global Holdings S.C.A.

    "text": "CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK\nDue to the global nature of our operations, we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes which may cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. We use operational and economic hedges, as well as currency exchange rate derivative instruments, to manage the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. In order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments, principally forward currency exchange rate contracts. These contracts are designed to hedge anticipated transactions in other currencies and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities. At inception of the contract, the derivative instrument is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge. Currencies of our derivative instruments include the Euro, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, and others. Fluctuations in the exchange rates of currency exposures that are unhedged, such as in certain emerging markets, may result in future earnings and cash flow volatility. We do not enter into currency exchange rate derivative instruments for speculative purposes.\nThe gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020 was $14.7 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively. At April 30, 2021, these contracts were in a net unrealized loss position of $211 million. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all currency exchange rate derivative contracts at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020 indicates that, if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened/weakened by 10 percent against all currencies, it would have the following impact on the fair value of these contracts:\nAny gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we began accounting for our operations in Argentina as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100 percent. The change did not have a material impact on our results for fiscal year ended 2021.\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nWe are subject to interest rate risk on our investments and our borrowings. We manage interest rate risk in the aggregate, while focusing on our immediate and intermediate liquidity needs. Our debt portfolio at April 30, 2021 was comprised of debt predominately denominated in U.S. dollars and the Euro, of which substantially all is fixed rate debt. We are also exposed to interest rate changes affecting our investments in interest rate sensitive instruments, which include our marketable debt securities. We enter into marketable debt security positions for cash management purposes.\nA sensitivity analysis of the impact on our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments of a hypothetical 10 basis point change in interest rates, as compared to interest rates at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020, would have the following impact on the fair value of these instruments:\nFor a discussion of current market conditions and the impact on our financial condition and results of operations, please see the “Liquidity” section of the Management's Discussion and Analysis in \"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    "text": "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the\nShareholders and Board of Directors of Medtronic plc\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Medtronic plc and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 30, 2021, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 30, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in fiscal year 2020.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable\n57\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nIncome Tax Reserve for the Uncertain Tax Position Related to Puerto Rico Manufacturing\nAs described in Notes 13 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, management records reserves for uncertain tax positions related to unresolved matters with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing authorities. A remaining unresolved issue with the IRS, relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico, which is one of the Company's manufacturing sites. These reserves are subject to a high degree of estimation and management judgment. Total reserves relating to uncertain tax positions as of April 30, 2021 were $1.668 billion, of which the Puerto Rico manufacturing reserve makes up a significant portion.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the income tax reserve for the uncertain tax position related to Puerto Rico manufacturing is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining the reserves, including a high degree of estimation uncertainty relative to the unresolved issue with the IRS involving one of the Company’s manufacturing sites. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort and subjectivity in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence to support management’s accurate measurement of the income tax reserve for the uncertain tax position related to Puerto Rico manufacturing, as the nature of the evidence is often highly subjective.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the recognition of the income tax reserves for uncertain tax positions, as well as controls over measurement of the reserves. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for determining the reserve for the uncertain tax position, (ii) evaluating the status and results of the U. S. Tax Court case, and (iii) evaluating the consistency of the reserve calculation with the relevant documents related to the tax court case.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1963.\n58\nMedtronic plc\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n59\nMedtronic plc\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n60\nMedtronic plc\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n61\nMedtronic plc\nConsolidated Statements of Equity\n(1)\nThe cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in fiscal year 2019 resulted from the adoption of accounting guidance that requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. As a result of the adoption, the Company reclassified $\n47\nmillion from\naccumulated other comprehensive loss\nto the opening balance of\nretained earnings\nas of April 28, 2018.\n(2)\nThe cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in fiscal year 2020 resulted from the adoption of accounting guidance that requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. As a result of the adoption, the Company adjusted the opening balance of retained earnings for $\n33\nmillion as of April 27, 2019.\n(3)\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding the adoption of accounting standards during fiscal year 2021.\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n62\nMedtronic plc\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n63\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nMedtronic plc (Medtronic or the Company) is among the world's largest medical technology, services, and solutions companies – alleviating pain, restoring health, and extending life for millions of people around the world. The Company provides innovative products and therapies to serve healthcare systems, physicians, clinicians, and patients. Medtronic was founded in 1949 and is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Medtronic plc, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, entities for which the Company has a controlling financial interest, and variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany transactions and balances have been fully eliminated in consolidation.\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to classifications used in the current year.\nAmounts reported in millions within this annual report are computed based on the amounts in thousands, and therefore, the sum of the components may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. Additionally, certain columns and rows within tables may not sum due to rounding.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used when accounting for items such as income taxes, contingencies, intangible asset, and liability valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.\nCOVID-19 has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and its future impacts remain highly uncertain and unpredictable. The Company has considered the disruptions caused by COVID-19, including lower sales and customer demand than the prior year in many businesses as well as macroeconomic factors. As a result, the Company has also assessed the potential impact on certain accounting estimates including, but not limited to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserves, return reserves, the valuation of goodwill, intangible assets, other long-lived assets, investments and contingent consideration, as of April 30, 2021 and through the date of this report. There was not a material impact to accounting estimates associated with the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020.\nFiscal Year-End\nThe Company utilizes a 52/53-week fiscal year, ending the last Friday in April, for the presentation of its consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020 and for each of the three fiscal years ended April 30, 2021 (fiscal year 2021), April 24, 2020 (fiscal year 2020), and April 26, 2019 (fiscal year 2019). Fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week year, with the extra week having occurred in the first fiscal month of the first quarter. Fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were 52-week years.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company considers highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.\nInvestments\nThe Company invests in marketable debt and equity securities, investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, and investments accounted for under the equity method.\nMarketable debt securities are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. These investments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The change in fair value for available-for-sale securities is recorded, net of taxes, as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive loss\non the consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date. The classification of marketable debt securities as current or long-term is based on the nature of the securities and the availability for use in current operations consistent with the Company's management of its capital structure and liquidity.\nCertain of the Company’s investments in marketable equity securities and other securities are long-term, strategic investments in companies that are in various stages of development and are included in\nother assets\non the consolidated balance sheets. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The change in fair value of marketable equity securities is recognized within\nother non-operating income, net\nin the consolidated statements of income. At each reporting period, the Company makes a qualitative assessment considering impairment indicators to evaluate whether the investment is impaired. Equity securities accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at the amount of the Company’s investment and are adjusted each period for the Company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividends paid. Securities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed quarterly for changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events that suggest other than temporary impairment has occurred.\n64\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Losses\nThe Company grants credit to customers in the normal course of business and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses. When evaluating allowances for doubtful accounts, the Company considers various factors, including historical experience and customer-specific information. Uncollectible accounts are written-off against the allowance when it is deemed that a customer account is uncollectible.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company reduces the carrying value of inventories for items that are potentially excess, obsolete, or slow-moving based on changes in customer demand, technology developments, or other economic factors.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Additions and improvements that extend the lives of the assets are capitalized, while expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The Company assesses property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment asset groupings may not be recoverable. The cost of interest that is incurred in connection with significant ongoing construction projects is capitalized using a weighted average interest rate. These costs are included in property, plant, and equipment and amortized over the useful life of the related asset. Upon retirement or disposal of property, plant, and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds, is recognized in earnings.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, goodwill is not amortized. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter of the fiscal year and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting unit level. The test for impairment of goodwill requires the Company to make several estimates about fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. The Company calculates the excess of each reporting unit's fair value over its carrying amount, including goodwill, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis. Internal operational budgets and long-range strategic plans are used as a basis for the cash flow analysis. The Company also utilizes assumptions for working capital, capital expenditures, and terminal growth rates. The discount rate applied to the cash flow analysis is based on the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) for each reporting unit. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.\nIntangible assets include patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, purchased technology, and in-process research and development (IPR&D). Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives typically ranging from\nthree\nto\n20\nyears. Amortization is recognized within\namortization of intangible assets\nin the consolidated statements of income. Intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an intangible asset may not be recoverable, the Company calculates the excess of an intangible asset's carrying value over its undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.\nAcquired IPR&D represents the fair value assigned to those research and development projects that were acquired in a business combination for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use. IPR&D is capitalized at its fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, and any development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred. The fair value of IPR&D is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. Upon achieving regulatory approval or commercial viability for the related product, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. If the project is not completed or is terminated or abandoned, the Company may have an impairment related to the IPR&D, which is charged to expense. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the third quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted future cash flow analysis. IPR&D acquired outside of a business combination is expensed immediately.\nContingent Consideration\nCertain of the Company’s business combinations involve potential payment of future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain product development milestones and/or contingent on the acquired business reaching certain performance milestones. The Company records contingent consideration at fair value at the date of acquisition based on the consideration expected to be transferred, estimated as the probability-weighted future cash flows, discounted back to present value. The fair value of contingent consideration is measured using projected payment dates,\n65\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\ndiscount rates, probabilities of payment, and projected revenues (for revenue-based considerations). Projected revenues are based on the Company’s most recent internal operational budgets and long-range strategic plans. The discount rate used is determined at the time of measurement in accordance with accepted valuation methodologies. Changes in projected revenues, probabilities of payment, discount rates, and projected payment dates may result in adjustments to the fair value measurements. Contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period using Level 3 inputs, and the change in fair value, including accretion for the passage of time, is recognized as income or expense within\nother operating expense, net\nin the consolidated statements of income. Contingent consideration payments made soon after the acquisition date are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Contingent consideration payments not made soon after the acquisition date that are related to the acquisition date fair value are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and amounts paid in excess of the original acquisition date fair value are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nSelf-Insurance\nThe Company self-insures the majority of its insurable risks, including medical and dental costs, disability coverage, physical loss to property, business interruptions, workers’ compensation, comprehensive general, and product liability. Insurance coverage is obtained for risks required to be insured by law or contract. The Company uses claims data and historical experience, as applicable, to estimate liabilities associated with the exposures that the Company has self-insured.\nRetirement Benefit Plan Assumptions\nThe Company sponsors various retirement benefit plans, including defined benefit pension plans, post-retirement medical plans, defined contribution savings plans, and termination indemnity plans, covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the U.S. See Note 15 for assumptions used in determining pension and post-retirement benefit costs and liabilities.\nDerivatives\nThe Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments in its consolidated financial statements at fair value in accordance with authoritative guidance on derivatives and hedging, and presents assets and liabilities associated with derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in the consolidated financial statements. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the hedging instrument must be designated as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge, based upon the exposure being hedged. See Note 7 for more information on the Company's derivative instruments and hedging programs.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company follows the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on both a recurring and nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The authoritative guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability, based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels defined as follows:\n•\nLevel 1 - Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2 - Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n•\nLevel 3 - Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability.\nFinancial assets that are classified as Level 1 securities include highly liquid government bonds within U.S. government and agency securities and marketable equity securities for which quoted market prices are available. In addition, the Company classifies currency forward contracts as Level 1 since they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets which have identical assets or liabilities.\nThe valuation for most fixed maturity securities are classified as Level 2. Financial assets that are classified as Level 2 include corporate debt securities, government and agency securities, other asset-backed securities, debt funds, and mortgage-backed securities whose value is determined using inputs that are observable in the market or may be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data such as pricing for similar securities, recently executed transactions, cash flow models with yield curves, and benchmark securities. In addition, interest rate swaps and total return swaps are included in Level 2 as\n66\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nthe Company uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset. The Level 2 derivative instruments are primarily valued using standard calculations and models that use readily observable market data as their basis.\nFinancial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. Financial assets that are classified as Level 3 include certain investment securities for which there is limited market activity such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation, certain corporate debt securities and auction rate securities. With the exception of auction rate securities, these securities are valued using third-party pricing sources that incorporate transaction details such as contractual terms, maturity, timing, and amount of expected future cash flows, as well as assumptions about liquidity and credit valuation adjustments by market participants. The fair value of auction rate securities is estimated by the Company using a discounted cash flow model, which incorporates significant unobservable inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s auction rate securities are years to principal recovery and the illiquidity premium that is incorporated into the discount rate. For goodwill, other intangible assets, and IPR&D, inputs used in the fair value analysis fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value.\nCertain investments for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Financial assets for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient include certain debt funds, equity and fixed income commingled trusts, and registered investment companies.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company sells its products through direct sales representatives and independent distributors. Additionally, a portion of the Company's revenue is generated from consignment inventory maintained at hospitals. The Company recognizes revenue when control is transferred to the customer. For products sold through direct sales representatives and independent distributors, control is transferred upon shipment or upon delivery, based on the contract terms and legal requirements. For consignment inventory, control is transferred when the product is used or implanted. Payment terms vary depending on the country of sale, type of customer, and type of product.\nIf a contract contains more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price. Shipping and handling is treated as a fulfillment activity rather than a promised service, and therefore, is not considered a performance obligation. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on, and concurrent with, a specific revenue producing transaction and collected by the Company from customers (for example, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes) are not included in revenue. For contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, the Company uses the practical expedient applicable to such contracts and does not adjust the transaction price for the time value of money.\nThe amount of revenue recognized reflects sales rebates and returns, which are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, and trend analysis. In estimating rebates, the Company considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the rebate claim, the stated rebate rates, and other relevant information. The Company records adjustments to rebates and returns reserves as increases or decreases of revenue.\nThe Company records a deferred revenue liability if a customer pays consideration before the Company transfers a good or service to the customer. Deferred revenue primarily represents remote monitoring services and equipment maintenance, for which consideration is received at the same time as consideration for the device or equipment. Revenue related to remote monitoring services and equipment maintenance is recognized over the service period as time elapses.\nRemaining performance obligations include deferred revenue and amounts the Company expects to receive for goods and services that have not yet been delivered or provided under existing, noncancellable contracts with minimum purchase commitments, primarily related to consumables for previously sold equipment as well as remote monitoring services and equipment maintenance. For contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, the Company has elected the practical expedient applicable to such contracts and does not disclose the transaction price for remaining performance obligations at the end of each reporting period and when the Company expects to recognize this revenue.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling costs incurred to physically move product from the Company's premises to the customer's premises are recognized in\nselling, general, and administrative expense\nin the consolidated statements of income and were $\n308\nmillion, $\n347\nmillion, and $\n350\nmillion in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Other shipping and handling costs incurred to store, move, and prepare products for shipment are recognized in\ncost of products sold\nin the consolidated statements of income.\n67\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed when incurred. Research and development costs include costs of research, engineering, and technical activities to develop a new product or service or make significant improvement to an existing product or manufacturing process. Research and development costs also include pre-approval regulatory and clinical trial expenses.\nContingencies\nThe Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable, and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has deferred taxes that arise as a result of the different treatment of transactions for U.S. GAAP and income tax accounting, known as temporary differences. The Company records the tax effect of these temporary differences as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that may be used as a tax deduction or credit in a tax return in future years for which the Company has already recognized the tax benefit in the consolidated statements of income. The Company establishes valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense for which payment has been deferred or expense has already been taken as a deduction on the Company’s tax return but has not yet been recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income.\nOther Operating Expense, Net\nOther operating expense, net primarily includes royalty income and expense, currency remeasurement and derivative gains and losses, Puerto Rico excise taxes, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, changes in amounts accrued for certain contingent liabilities for a recent acquisition, a commitment to the Medtronic Foundation, charges associated with business exits, impairment charges, IPR&D charges, and income from funded research and development arrangements.\nOther Non-Operating Income, Net\nOther non-operating income, net includes the non-service component of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost, investment gains and losses, and interest income.\nCurrency Translation\nAssets and liabilities of non-U.S. dollar functional currency entities are translated to U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates, and the currency impacts arising from the translation of the assets and liabilities are recorded as a cumulative translation adjustment, a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive loss,\non the consolidated balance sheets. Elements of the consolidated statements of income are translated at the average monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. Currency transaction gains and losses are included in\nother operating expense, net\nin the consolidated statements of income.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures stock-based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognizes the compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are expected to vest. The Company estimates pre-vesting forfeitures at the time of grant and revises the estimates in subsequent periods.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance changing the methodology to be used to measure credit losses for certain financial instruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. The new methodology requires the recognition of an allowance that reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset. The Company adopted this guidance using the modified retrospective method in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. This guidance also requires additional qualitative and quantitative lease related disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted this guidance using the modified retrospective method in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.\n68\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nDuring the implementation, the Company elected the package of practical expedients available under the transition guidance that allowed an entity not to reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, the classification for any expired or existing leases or any initial direct costs for existing leases. Further, the Company made accounting policy elections to not apply the recognition requirements to short-term leases and to account for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component.\nThe adoption of this guidance resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in an amount of approximately $\n1.0\nbillion, an immaterial cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of April 27, 2019, and expansion of lease related disclosures\n.\nThe adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statements of income or consolidated statements of cash flows.\n2.\nRevenue\nThe Company's revenues are principally derived from device-based medical therapies and services related to cardiac rhythm disorders, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, neurological disorders and diseases, spinal conditions and musculoskeletal trauma, chronic pain, urological and digestive disorders, ear, nose, and throat conditions, and diabetes conditions as well as advanced and general surgical care products, respiratory and monitoring solutions, and neurological surgery technologies. The Company's primary customers include healthcare systems, clinics, third-party healthcare providers, distributors, and other institutions, including governmental healthcare programs and group purchasing organizations.\nDuring the first and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2021, the Company realigned its divisions within Neuroscience and Cardiovascular, respectively. As a result, fiscal year 2020 and 2019 revenue has been recast to adjust for these realignments Additionally, the Company implemented a new operating model in fiscal year 2021, which was fully operational beginning in the fourth quarter.\nThe table below illustrates net sales by segment and division for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n69\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe table below includes net sales by market geography and segment for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n(1)\nU.S. includes the United States and U.S. territories.\n(2)\nNon-U.S. developed markets include Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Canada, and the countries within Western Europe.\n(3)\nEmerging markets include the countries of the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the countries of Asia that are not included in the non-U.S. developed markets, as defined above.\nAt April 30, 2021, $\n906\nmillion of rebates were classified as\nother accrued expenses,\nand\n$\n485\nmillion of rebates were classified as a reduction of\naccounts receivable\nin the consolidated balance sheet. At April 24, 2020, $\n706\nmillion of rebates were classified as\nother accrued expenses,\nand $\n321\nmillion of rebates were classified as a reduction of\naccounts receivable\nin the consolidated balance sheet. During fiscal year 2021, adjustments to rebate and return reserves recognized in revenue that were included in the rebate and return reserves at the beginning of the period were not material.\nDeferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations\nDeferred revenue at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020 was $\n368\nmillion and $\n303\nmillion, respectively. At April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020, $\n276\nmillion and $\n213\nmillion was included in\nother accrued expenses\n, respectively, and $\n93\nmillion and $\n90\nmillion was included in\nother liabilities\n, respectively. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, the Company recognized $\n236\nmillion of revenue that was included in deferred revenue as of April 24, 2020.\nAt April 30, 2021, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied for executed contracts with an original duration of one year or more was approximately $\n1.3\nbillion. The Company expects to recognize revenue on the majority of these remaining performance obligations over the next\nfour years\n.\n3.\nAcquisitions\nThe Company had acquisitions during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 that were accounted for as business combinations. The assets and liabilities of businesses acquired were recorded and consolidated on the acquisition date at their respective fair values. Goodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to future yet to be defined technologies, new customer relationships, existing workforce of the acquired businesses, and synergies expected to arise after the Company's acquisition of these businesses. The pro forma impact of acquisitions during fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was not significant, either individually or in the aggregate, to the consolidated results of the Company. The results of operations of acquired businesses have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income since the date each business was acquired.\nFiscal Year 2021\nThe acquisition date fair value of net assets acquired during fiscal year 2021 was $\n1.2\nbillion, consisting of $\n1.4\nbillion of assets acquired and $\n161\nmillion of liabilities assumed. Based upon preliminary valuations, assets acquired were primarily comprised of $\n417\nmillion of technology-based intangible assets and $\n13\nmillion of customer-related intangible assets with estimated useful lives ranging from\n8\nto\n15\nyears, and $\n816\nmillion of goodwill. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The Company recognized $\n253\nmillion of contingent consideration liabilities in connection with business combinations during fiscal year 2021, which are comprised of revenue and regulatory milestone-based payments. Additionally, the Company recognized a gain of $\n132\nmillion related to a change in amounts accrued for certain contingent liabilities from a recent acquisition. The benefit was recognized in\nother operating expense, net\nin the consolidated statements of income as the purchase accounting was finalized in fiscal year 2020. Purchase price allocation adjustments for fiscal year 2021 business combinations were not significant.\n70\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFiscal Year 2020\nThe acquisition date fair value of net assets acquired during fiscal year 2020 was $\n612\nmillion, consisting of $\n679\nmillion of assets acquired and $\n67\nmillion of liabilities assumed. Assets acquired were primarily comprised of $\n236\nmillion of technology-based intangible assets and $\n26\nmillion of customer-related intangible assets with estimated useful lives ranging from\n8\nto\n16\nyears, $\n333\nmillion of goodwill, and $\n40\nmillion of inventory. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The Company recognized $\n80\nmillion of contingent consideration liabilities in connection with business combinations during fiscal year 2020, which are comprised of revenue and regulatory milestone-based payments. Purchase price allocation adjustments for fiscal year 2020 business combinations were not significant.\nContingent Consideration\nThe fair value of contingent consideration at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020 was $\n270\nmillion and $\n280\nmillion, respectively. At April 30, 2021, $\n78\nmillion was recorded in\nother accrued expenses\n, and $\n192\nmillion was recorded in\nother liabilities\non the consolidated balance sheets. At April 24, 2020, $\n112\nmillion was reflected in\nother accrued expenses\n, and $\n168\nmillion was reflected in\nother liabilities\non the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of contingent consideration:\nThe recurring Level 3 fair value measurements of contingent consideration for which a liability is recorded include the following significant unobservable inputs:\n(1) Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liability. For projected fiscal year of payment, the amount represents the median of the inputs and is not a weighted average.\n4.\nRestructuring Charges\nEnterprise Excellence\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company announced its Enterprise Excellence restructuring program, which is expected to leverage the Company's global size and scale, as well as enhance the customer and employee experience, with a focus on three objectives: global operations, functional optimization, and commercial optimization. Primary activities of the restructuring program include integrating and enhancing global manufacturing and supply processes, systems and site presence, enhancing and leveraging global operating models across several enabling functions, and optimizing certain commercial processes, systems, and models.\nThe Company estimates that, in connection with its Enterprise Excellence restructuring program, it will recognize pre-tax exit and disposal costs and other costs across all segments of approximately $\n1.6\nbillion to $\n1.8\nbillion, the majority of which are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2022. Approximately\n40\npercent of the estimated charges are related to employee termination benefits. The remaining charges are costs associated with the restructuring program, such as salaries and benefits for employees supporting the program, including program management and transition teams, and strategic and operational consulting services related to the three objectives of the program discussed above. These charges are recognized\n71\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nwithin\nrestructuring charges, net, cost of products sold,\nand\nselling, general, and administrative expense\nin the consolidated statements of income.\nFor fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized net charges of $\n349\nmillion, $\n441\nmillion, and $\n424\nmillion, respectively. For fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, charges included $\n128\nmillion, $\n155\nmillion, and $\n91\nmillion, respectively, recognized within\ncost of products sold,\nand $\n169\nmillion, $\n168\nmillion, and $\n118\nmillion, respectively, recognized within\nselling, general, and administrative expense\nin the consolidated statements of income.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to the Enterprise Excellence restructuring program for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n(1)\nAssociated costs include costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses.\n(2)\nAccrual adjustments relate to certain employees identified for termination finding other positions within Medtronic and contract terminations being settled for less than originally estimated.\nSimplification\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company initiated the Simplification restructuring program, designed to make the Company a more nimble and competitive organization focused on accelerating innovation, enhancing the customer experience, driving revenue growth, and winning market share, while also more efficiently and effectively leveraging the enterprise scale. Under the oversight of the portfolio leaders, this new operating model, which became fully operational the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, will simplify the Company's organizational structure and accelerate decision-making and execution. Primary activities of the restructuring program will include reorganizing the Company into a portfolio-level structure, including the creation of highly focused, accountable, and empowered Operating Units (OUs), consolidating Operations at the enterprise level, establishing Technology Development Centers in areas where the Company has deep core technology competencies to be leveraged by multiple OUs, and forming dedicated sales organizations that leverage the Company's scale but move with the same agility as smaller, local competitors.\nThe Company estimates that, in connection with its Simplification restructuring program, it will recognize pre-tax exit and disposal costs and other costs across all segments of approximately $\n400\nmillion to $\n450\nmillion, the majority of which are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2022. Approximately three quarters of the estimated charges are related to employee termination benefits. The remaining charges are costs associated with the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses to execute the reorganization of our business into a portfolio-like structure as discussed above. These charges are recognized within\nrestructuring charges, net\nand\nselling, general, and administrative expense\nin the consolidated statements of income.\n72\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nFor fiscal year 2021, the Company recognized net charges of $\n268\nmillion, which included $\n97\nmillion of incremental defined benefit pension and post-retirement related expenses for employees that accepted voluntary early retirement packages. These costs are not included in the table summarizing restructuring charges below, as they are associated with costs that are accounted for under the pension and post-retirement rules. See Note 15 for further discussion on the incremental defined benefit pension and post-retirement expenses. The charges recognized for fiscal year 2021 included $\n27\nmillion recognized within\nselling, general, and administrative expense\nin the consolidated statements of income.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to the Simplification restructuring program for fiscal year 2021:\n(1)  Associated costs include costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses.\n(2)   Accrual adjustments relate to certain employees identified for termination finding other positions within the Company.\n5.\nFinancial Instruments\nDebt Securities\nThe Company holds investments in marketable debt securities that are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale and are remeasured on a recurring basis.\nThe following tables summarize the Company's investments in available-for-sale debt securities by significant investment category and the related consolidated balance sheet classification at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020:\n73\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe amortized cost of debt securities excludes accrued interest, which is reported in\nother current assets\nin the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following tables present the gross unrealized losses and fair values of the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position deemed to be temporary, aggregated by investment category at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020:\nThe Company reviews the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 during the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020. When a determination is made to classify an asset or liability within Level 3, the determination is based upon the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.\n74\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nActivity related to the Company’s available for sale securities portfolio is as follows:\nDuring the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, the Company had proceeds from maturities of investments classified as held to maturity of $\n911\nmillion.\nThe April 30, 2021 balance of available-for-sale debt securities by contractual maturity is shown in the following table. Within the table, maturities of mortgage-backed securities have been allocated based upon timing of estimated cash flows assuming no change in the current interest rate environment. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.\nEquity Securities, Equity Method Investments, and Other Investments\nThe Company commonly holds investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values, equity investments without readily determinable fair values, investments accounted for under the equity method, and other investments. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, as they are measured using quoted market prices. Equity method investments and investments without readily determinable fair values are included within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value. To determine the fair value of these investments, the Company uses all pertinent financial information available related to the investees, including financial statements, market participant valuations from recent and proposed equity offerings, and other third-party data.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's equity and other investments at\nApril 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020, which are classified as\nother assets\nin the consolidated balance sheets:\nThe table below includes activity related to the Company’s portfolio of equity and other investments. Gains and losses on equity and other investments are recognized in\nother non-operating income, net\nin the consolidated statements of income.\nDuring the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, there were $\n63\nmillion of net unrealized gains on equity securities and other investments still held at April 30, 2021. During the fiscal year ended April 24, 2020, there were $\n15\nmillion of net unrealized losses on equity securities and other investments still held at April 24, 2020.\n75\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n6.\nFinancing Arrangements\nCurrent debt obligations consisted of the following:\nBank Borrowings\nOutstanding bank borrowings at April 30, 2021 were not significant. Outstanding bank borrowings at April 24, 2020 were short-term advances primarily to non-U.S. subsidiaries under credit agreements with various banks. These bank borrowings consisted primarily of borrowings in Japanese Yen at an interest rate of\n0.21\n%, and were a natural hedge of currency and exchange rate risk.\nCommercial Paper\nOn January 26, 2015, Medtronic Global Holdings S.C.A. (Medtronic Luxco), an entity organized under the laws of Luxembourg, entered into various agreements pursuant to which Medtronic Luxco may issue United States Dollar-denominated unsecured commercial paper notes (the 2015 CP Program) on a private placement basis, and on January 31, 2020 Medtronic Luxco entered into various agreements pursuant to which Medtronic Luxco may issue Euro-denominated unsecured commercial paper notes (the 2020 CP Program) on a private placement basis. The Maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time under the 2015 CP Program and the 2020 CP Program together may not exceed the equivalent of $\n3.5\nbillion. The Company and Medtronic, Inc. have guaranteed the obligations of Medtronic Luxco under the 2015 CP Program and the 2020 CP Program.\nThere was\nno\ncommercial paper outstanding at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020 or during fiscal year 2021. During fiscal year 2020, the weighted average original maturity of the commercial paper outstanding was approximately\n7\ndays and the weighted average interest rate was\n2.31\npercent. The issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under the Company's existing credit facility, defined below.\nLine of Credit\nOn December 12, 2020, Medtronic Luxco, as borrower, entered into an amendment to its amended and restated credit agreement (Credit Facility), by and among Medtronic, Medtronic, Inc., Medtronic Luxco, the lenders from time to time party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and issuing bank, extending the maturity date of the Credit Facility to December 2025.\nThe Credit Facility provides for a $\n3.5\nbillion\nfive-year\nunsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Facility). At each anniversary date of the Credit Facility, but not more than twice prior to the maturity date, the Company could also request a\none-year\nextension of the maturity date. The Credit Facility provides the Company with the ability to increase its borrowing capacity by an additional $\n1.0\nbillion at any time during the term of the agreement. The Company and Medtronic, Inc. have guaranteed the obligations of the borrowers under the Credit Facility, and Medtronic Luxco will also guarantee the obligations of any designated borrower. The Credit Facility includes a multi-currency borrowing feature for certain specified foreign currencies. At April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020,\nno\namounts were outstanding under the Credit Facility.\nInterest rates on advances on the Credit Facility are determined by a pricing matrix based on the Company’s long-term debt ratings, assigned by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors Service. Facility fees are payable on the Credit Facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates. The Company is in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Facility.\n76\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nLong-term debt consisted of the following:\n77\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nSenior Notes\nThe Company has outstanding unsecured senior obligations, described as senior notes in the tables above (collectively, the Senior Notes). The Senior Notes rank equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Company. The Company is in compliance with all covenants related to the Seniors notes.\nIn June 2019, Medtronic Luxco issued\nsix\ntranches of Euro-denominated Senior Notes with an aggregate principal of €\n5.0\nbillion, with maturities ranging from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2050, resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $\n5.6\nbillion, net of discounts and issuance costs. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering to fund the cash tender offer and early redemption of $\n5.2\nbillion of Medtronic Inc., CIFSA, and Medtronic Luxco Senior Notes for $\n5.6\nbillion of total consideration. The Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $\n413\nmillion in fiscal year 2020, which primarily included cash premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums. The loss was recognized in\ninterest expense\nin the consolidated statement of income.\nIn September 2020, Medtronic Luxco issued an additional\nsix\ntranches of Euro-denominated Senior Notes with an aggregate principal of €\n6.3\nbillion, with maturities ranging from fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2051, resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $\n7.2\nbillion, net of discounts and issuance costs. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering to fund the early redemption of $\n4.3\nbillion of Medtronic Inc. and CIFSA Senior Notes and €\n1.5\nbillion of Medtronic Luxco Senior Notes for $\n6.3\nbillion of total consideration in October 2020. Additionally, the Company used the proceeds to repay its €\n750\nmillion floating rate senior notes at maturity in March 2021. The Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $\n308\nmillion in fiscal year 2021, which primarily included cash premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums. The loss was recognized in\ninterest expense\nin the consolidated statement of income.\nThe Euro-denominated debt issued in June 2019 and September 2020 is designated as a net investment hedge of certain of the Company's European operations. Refer to Note 7 for additional information regarding the net investment hedge.\nTerm Loan Agreements\nOn May 12, 2020, Medtronic Luxco entered into a term loan agreement (Loan Agreement) by and among Medtronic Luxco, Medtronic plc, Medtronic, Inc., and Mizuho Bank, Ltd. as administrative agent and as lender. The Loan Agreement provided an unsecured term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to ¥\n300\nbillion, with a term of\nsix months\nand the option to extend for an additional\nsix months\nat Medtronic Luxco’s option. On May 13, 2020, Medtronic Luxco borrowed the entire amount of the term loan under the Loan Agreement. The Japanese Yen-denominated debt was designated as a net investment hedge of certain of our Japanese operations. Borrowings under the Loan Agreement carried interest at the TIBOR Rate (as defined in the Loan Agreement) plus a margin of\n0.50\n% per annum. Medtronic plc and Medtronic, Inc. guaranteed the obligations of Medtronic Luxco under the Loan Agreement. On November 12, 2020, the Company exercised its option to extend the term loan for an additional\nsix months\n. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company de-designated the Yen-denominated debt as a net investment hedge and repaid the term loan in full, including interest.\nContractual maturities of debt for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, excluding deferred financing costs and debt discount, net, are as follows:\nFinancial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value\nAt April 30, 2021, the estimated fair value of the Company’s Senior Notes was $\n28.6\nbillion compared to a principal value of $\n26.5\nbillion. At April 24, 2020 the estimated fair value was $\n27.1\nbillion compared to a principal value of $\n24.5\nbillion. There was\nno\ncommercial paper outstanding during fiscal year 2021. The fair value was estimated using quoted market prices for the publicly registered Senior Notes, which are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair values and principal values consider the terms of the related debt and exclude the impacts of debt discounts and hedging activity.\n78\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n7.\nDerivatives and Currency Exchange Risk Management\nThe Company uses operational and economic hedges, including currency exchange rate derivative contracts and interest rate derivative instruments, to manage the impact of currency exchange and interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. In addition, the Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk related to certain debt. In order to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from currency exchange rate changes, the Company enters into derivative instruments, principally forward currency exchange rate contracts. These contracts are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions and changes in the value of specific assets and liabilities. At inception of the contract, the derivative is designated as either a freestanding derivative or a cash flow hedge. Currencies of our derivative instruments include the Euro, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, and others. The Company does not enter into currency exchange rate derivative contracts for speculative purposes. The gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding was $\n14.7\nbillion and $\n11.9\nbillion at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020, respectively.\nThe Company also uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes on net investments in foreign currency-denominated operations. The information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by the Company, reasons the Company uses such instruments, and the impact such instruments have on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and statements of income.\nFreestanding Derivative Contracts\nFreestanding derivative contracts are primarily used to offset the Company’s exposure to the change in value of specific foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities, and to offset variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The gross notional amount of the Company's freestanding currency exchange rate contracts outstanding at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020 was $\n5.7\nbillion and $\n4.9\nbillion, respectively. The Company's freestanding currency exchange rate contracts are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the value of these contracts are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related change in value of foreign-currency-denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows.\nThe Company also uses total return swaps to hedge the liability of a non-qualified, deferred compensation plan. The gross notional amount of the Company's total return swaps outstanding at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020 was $\n243\nmillion and $\n181\nmillion, respectively. The Company's total return swaps are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the value of these instruments are recognized in earnings. The cash flows related to the Company's freestanding derivative contracts are reported as operating activities or financing activities, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged item, in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe amounts and classification of the (gains) losses in the consolidated statements of income related to derivative instruments, not designated as hedging instruments, for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 were as follows:\nCash Flow Hedges\nForward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are designed to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in a foreign currency that will take place in the future. The gross notional amount of these contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, outstanding at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020 was $\n9.0\nbillion and $\n7.0\nbillion, respectively, and will mature within the subsequent\nthree-year\nperiod. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive loss\n. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reclassified into earnings and is included in\nother operating expense, net\nor\ncost of products sold\nin the consolidated statements of income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts excluded from the measurement of hedge effectiveness are recognized in earnings in the current period. The cash flows related to all of the Company's derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. No components of the hedge contracts were excluded in the measurement of hedge effectiveness, and no forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges were derecognized or discontinued during fiscal years 2021, 2020, or 2019.\n79\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe amount of the (gains) losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) related to currency exchange rate contract derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 were as follows:\nThe amount of the (gains) losses recognized in the consolidated statements of income related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 were as follows:\nForecasted Debt Issuance Interest Rate Risk\nForward starting interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are designed to manage the exposure to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed-rate debt. The gains or losses on forward starting interest rate derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are reported as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive loss\n. Beginning in the period in which the planned debt issuance occurs and the related derivative instruments are terminated, the gains or losses are then reclassified into\ninterest expense\nover the term of the related debt. For fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, the reclassifications of net (gains) losses on forward starting interest rate derivative instruments from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense were not significant.\nAt April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020, the Company had $\n253\nmillion in after-tax unrealized losses and $\n266\nmillion in after-tax net unrealized gains, respectively, associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive loss\n. The Company expects that $\n146\nmillion of after-tax net unrealized losses at April 30, 2021 will be recognized in the consolidated statements of income over the next 12 months.\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe Company has designated Euro-denominated debt as a net investment hedge of certain of its European operations to manage the exposure to currency and exchange rate movements for foreign currency-denominated net investments in foreign operations. At April 30, 2021, the Company had €\n16.0\nbillion, or $\n19.3\nbillion, of outstanding Euro-denominated debt designated as a hedge of its net investment in certain of its European operations, which will mature in fiscal years 2023 through fiscal year 2051.\nIn February 2021, the Company de-designated ¥\n300\nbillion of outstanding Yen-denominated debt previously designated as a net investment hedge and concurrently entered into freestanding forward derivative contracts with a total notional value of ¥\n300\nbillion, or approximately $\n2.9\nbillion. These forward contracts were not designated as hedges. The Company used the proceeds from these forward derivative contracts to repay the ¥\n300\nbillion of Yen-denominated debt in conjunction with the maturity of these forward contracts in March and April of 2021.\n80\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nAdditionally, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company entered into and settled forward currency exchange rate contracts to manage the exposure to exchange rate movements in anticipation of the issuance of Euro-denominated senior notes. Certain of these forward currency exchange rate contracts were designated as a net investment hedge of certain of the Company's European operations. These contracts matured in conjunction with the issuance of the Euro-denominated debt in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.\nFor instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the gains or losses are reported as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive loss\n. The gains or losses are reclassified into earnings upon a liquidation event or deconsolidation of the foreign subsidiary. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in\nother operating expense, net\n. The cash flows related to the Company's derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are reported as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAt April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020, the Company had $\n1.5\nbillion in after-tax unrealized losses, and $\n236\nmillion in after-tax unrealized gains associated with net investment hedges recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive loss,\nrespectively. The Company does\nno\nt expect any of the after-tax unrealized losses at April 30, 2021 to be recognized in the consolidated statements of income over the next 12 months.\nThe Company did\nno\nt recognize any gains or losses during fiscal years 2021, 2020, or 2019 on instruments that no longer qualify as net investment hedges.\nThe amount and classifications of the (gains) losses recognized in the consolidated statements of income for the portion of the net investment hedges excluded from the measurement of hedge effectiveness were as follows:\nThe amount of the (gains) losses recognized in AOCI related to instruments designated as net investment hedges for fiscal year 2021, 2020, or 2019 were as follows:\n81\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nBalance Sheet Presentation\nThe following tables summarize the balance sheet classification and fair value of derivative instruments included in the consolidated balance sheets at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020. The fair value amounts are presented on a gross basis, and are segregated between derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments and those that are not designated and do not qualify as hedging instruments, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories.\nThe following table provides information by level for the derivative assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nThe Company has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis, even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. The cash flows related to collateral posted and received are reported gross as investing and financing activities, respectively, in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n82\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe following tables provide information as if the Company had elected to offset the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted in accordance with various criteria as stipulated by the terms of the master netting arrangements with each of the counterparties. Derivatives not subject to master netting arrangements are not eligible for net presentation.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of interest-bearing investments, forward exchange derivative contracts, and trade accounts receivable. Global concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business.\nThe Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, investments, and certain other financial instruments (including currency exchange rate and interest rate derivative contracts) with various major financial institutions. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standings of these financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. In addition, the Company has collateral credit agreements with its primary derivatives counterparties. Under these agreements, either party is required to post eligible collateral when the market value of transactions covered by the agreement exceeds specific thresholds, thus limiting credit exposure for both parties. As of April 30, 2021, the Company posted net cash collateral of $\n46\nmillion to its counterparties. As of April 24, 2020, the Company received net cash collateral of $\n48\nmillion from its counterparties. Cash collateral posted is recorded as a reduction in\ncash and cash equivalents\n, with the offset recorded\n83\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nas an increase in\nother current assets\nin the consolidated balance sheets. Cash collateral received is recorded as an increase in\ncash and cash equivalents\nwith the offset recorded in\nother accrued expenses\nin the consolidated balance sheets.\n8.\nInventories\nInventory balances, net of reserves, were as follows:\n9.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nThe following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment:\nThe Company did\nno\nt recognize any goodwill impairments during fiscal years 2021, 2020, or 2019.\nIntangible Assets\nThe following table presents the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets:\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company recognized $\n30\nmillion of definite-lived intangible asset charges in connection with the abandonment of certain intangible assets within the Neuroscience segment. During fiscal year 2020, the Company recognized $\n37\nmillion of definite-lived intangible asset charges, including $\n33\nmillion and $\n4\nmillion recognized in connection with\n84\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nbusiness exits in the Neuroscience and Cardiovascular segments, respectively. During fiscal year 2019, the Company recognized $\n87\nmillion of definite-lived intangible asset charges, including $\n61\nmillion and $\n26\nmillion recognized in connection with business exits in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience segments, respectively. Definite-lived intangible asset charges are recognized in\nother operating expense, net\nin the consolidated statements of income.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company recognized $\n45\nmillion of indefinite-lived intangible asset charges related to the abandonment of certain IPR&D projects in the Neuroscience segment. During fiscal year 2020, the Company recognized $\n35\nmillion of indefinite-lived intangible asset charges, including $\n25\nmillion relating to a partial impairment of an IPR&D project within the Neuroscience segment and $\n10\nmillion in connection with the discontinuation of an IPR&D project within the Cardiovascular segment. During fiscal year 2019, the Company recognized $\n30\nmillion of indefinite-lived intangible asset charges, including $\n11\nmillion in connection with a business exit in the Neuroscience segment, and $\n10\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion in connection with the discontinuation of certain IPR&D projects within the Medical Surgical and Cardiovascular segments, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangible asset charges are recognized in\nother operating expense, net\nin the consolidated statements of income. Due to the nature of IPR&D projects, the Company may experience future delays or failures to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials, failures of such clinical trials, delays or failures to obtain required market clearances, other failures to achieve a commercially viable product, or the discontinuation of certain projects, and as a result, may recognize impairment losses in the future.\nAmortization\nIntangible asset amortization expense was $\n1.8\nbillion for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nEstimated aggregate amortization expense by fiscal year based on the current carrying value and remaining estimated useful lives of definite-lived intangible assets at April 30, 2021, excluding any possible future amortization associated with acquired IPR&D which has not met technological feasibility, is as follows:\n10.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment balances and corresponding estimated useful lives were as follows:\nDepreciation expense of $\n919\nmillion, $\n907\nmillion, and $\n895\nmillion was recognized in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n11.\nShareholders’ Equity\nShare Capital\nMedtronic plc is authorized to issue\n2.6\nbillion Ordinary Shares, $\n0.0001\npar value;\n40\nthousand Euro Deferred Shares, €\n1.00\npar value;\n127.5\nmillion Preferred Shares, $\n0.20\npar value; and\n500\nthousand A Preferred Shares, $\n1.00\npar value.\n85\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nEuro Deferred Shares\nThe authorized share capital of the Company includes\n40\nthousand Euro Deferred Shares, with a par value of €\n1.00\nper share. At April 30, 2021,\nno\nEuro Deferred Shares were issued or outstanding.\nPreferred Shares\nThe authorized share capital of the Company includes\n127.5\nmillion of Preferred Shares, with a par value of $\n0.20\nper share. At April 30, 2021,\nno\nPreferred Shares were issued or outstanding.\nA Preferred Shares\nThe authorized share capital of the Company includes\n500\nthousand A Preferred Shares, with a par value of $\n1.00\nper share. At April 30, 2021,\n1,872\nA Preferred Shares were outstanding. The holders of A Preferred Shares are entitled to payment of dividends prior to any other class of shares in the Company equal to twice the dividend to be paid per Company ordinary share. On a return of assets, whether on liquidation or otherwise, the A Preferred Shares are entitled to repayment of the capital paid up thereon in priority to any repayment of capital to the holders of any other shares and the holders of the A Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to any further participation in the assets or profits of the Company. The holders of the A Preferred Shares are not entitled to receive notice of, nor to attend, speak, or vote at any general meeting of the Company.\nDividends\nThe timing, declaration, and payment of future dividends to holders of the Company's ordinary and A Preferred shares falls within the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and depends upon many factors, including the statutory requirements of Irish law, the Company's earnings and financial condition, the capital requirements of the Company's businesses, industry practice and any other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant.\nOrdinary Share Repurchase Program\nShares are repurchased from time to time to support the Company’s stock-based compensation programs and to return capital to shareholders. During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the Company repurchased approximately\n4\nmillion and\n12\nmillion shares, respectively, at an average price of $\n126.80\nand $\n106.22\n, respectively.\nIn March 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized $\n6.0\nbillion for repurchase of the Company's ordinary shares. There is no specific time-period associated with these repurchase authorizations. At April 30, 2021, the Company had used $\n608\nmillion of the $\n6.0\nbillion authorized under the repurchase program, leaving approximately $\n5.4\nbillion available for future repurchases. The Company accounts for repurchases of ordinary shares using the par value method and shares repurchased are cancelled.\n12.\nStock Purchase and Award Plans\nIn fiscal year 2021, the Company granted stock awards under the Medtronic plc 2013 Plan (2013 Plan). The 2013 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards, and other stock and cash-based awards. At April 30, 2021, there were approximately\n26\nmillion shares available for future grants under the 2013 Plan.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table presents the components and classification of stock-based compensation expense recognized for stock options, restricted stock, performance share units, and employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n86\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nStock Options\nOptions are granted at the exercise price, which is equal to the closing price of the Company’s ordinary shares on the grant date. The majority of the Company’s options are non-qualified options with a\n10\n-year life and a\n4\n-year ratable vesting term. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model (Black-Scholes model) to determine the fair value of stock options at the grant date. The fair value of stock options under the Black-Scholes model requires management to make assumptions regarding projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates, volatility of the Company’s stock price, and expected dividends.\nThe following table provides the weighted average fair value of options granted to employees and the related assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model:\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity during fiscal year 2021:\nThe following table summarizes the total cash received from the issuance of new shares upon stock option award exercises, the total intrinsic value of options exercised, and the related tax benefit during fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nUnrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding stock options at April 30, 2021 was $\n76\nmillion and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n2.6\nyears.\nRestricted Stock\nRestricted stock units are expensed over the vesting period and are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions. The expense recognized for restricted stock units is equal to the grant date fair value, which is equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, restricted stock units have a\n4\n-year ratable vesting term. Restricted stock units issued prior to fiscal year 2018 cliff vest after\nfour years\n. The Company also grants shares of performance-based restricted stock units that typically cliff vest after\nthree years\nonly if the Company has also achieved certain performance objectives. Performance awards are expensed over the performance period based on the\n87\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nprobability of achieving the performance objectives. Restricted stock units are not considered issued or outstanding ordinary shares of the Company. Dividend equivalent units are accumulated on restricted stock units during the vesting period.\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock activity during fiscal year 2021:\nThe following table summarizes the weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted stock granted, total fair value of restricted stock vested and related tax benefit during fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nUnrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock as of April 30, 2021 was $\n316\nmillion and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n2.4\nyears.\nPerformance Share Units\nBeginning in fiscal year 2021, the Company granted performance share units to officers and key employees. Performance share units typically cliff vest after\nthree years\n. The awards include three metrics: relative total shareholder return (rTSR), revenue growth, and return on investor capital (ROIC). rTSR is considered a market condition metric, and the expense is determined at the grant date and will not be adjusted even if the market condition is not met. Revenue growth and ROIC are considered performance metrics, and the expense is recorded over the performance period, which will be reassessed each reporting period based on the probability of achieving the various performance conditions. The number of shares earned at the end of the\nthree-year\nperiod will vary, based on only actual performance, from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of the target number of performance share units granted. Performance share units are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions. Performance share units are not considered issued or outstanding ordinary shares of the Company. Dividend equivalent units are accumulated on performance share units for each component of the award during the vesting period.\nThe Company calculates the fair value of the performance share units for each component individually. The fair value of the rTSR metric will be determined using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value of the revenue growth and ROIC metrics are equal to the closing stock price on the grant date.\nThe following table summarizes performance share unit activity during fiscal year 2021:\n88\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the weighted-average grant date fair value of performance share units granted, total fair value of performance share units vested and related tax benefit during fiscal year 2021:\nUnrecognized compensation expense related to performance share units as of April 30, 2021 was $\n57\nmillion and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n2.2\nyears.\nEmployees Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Medtronic plc Amended and Restated 2014 Employees Stock Purchase Plan allows participating employees to purchase the Company's ordinary shares at a discount through payroll deductions. The expense recognized for shares purchased under the Company’s ESPP is equal to the\n15\npercent discount the employee receives. Employees purchased\n2\nmillion shares at an average price of $\n90.16\nper share in fiscal year 2021. At April 30, 2021, approximately\n9\nmillion ordinary shares were available for future purchase under the ESPP.\n13.\nIncome Taxes\nThe income tax provision (benefit) is based on income before income taxes reported for financial statement purposes.\nThe components of income before income taxes, based on tax jurisdiction, are as follows:\nThe income tax provision (benefit) consists of the following:\n89\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nTax assets (liabilities), shown before jurisdictional netting of deferred tax assets (liabilities), are comprised of the following:\nNo deferred taxes have been provided on the approximately $\n74.2\nbillion and $\n69.9\nbillion of undistributed earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020, respectively, since these earnings have been, and under current plans will continue to be, permanently reinvested in these subsidiaries. Due to the number of legal entities and jurisdictions involved, the complexity of the legal entity structure of the Company, and the complexity of the tax laws in the relevant jurisdictions, the Company believes it is not practicable to estimate, within any reasonable range, the amount of additional taxes which may be payable upon distribution of these undistributed earnings.\nAt April 30, 2021, the Company had approximately $\n25.2\nbillion of net operating loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, of which\n$\n20.2\nbillion have no expiration, and the remaining $\n5.0\nbillion will expire during fiscal years 2022 through 2041. Included in these net operating loss carryforwards are $\n18.5\nbillion of net operating losses related to a subsidiary of the Company, substantially all of which were recorded in fiscal year 2008 as a result of the receipt of a favorable tax ruling from certain non-U.S. taxing authorities. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against these net operating\n90\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nlosses, as management does not believe that it is more likely than not that these net operating losses will be utilized. Certain of the remaining non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $\n6.7\nbillion have a valuation allowance recorded against the carryforwards, as management does not believe that it is more likely than not that these net operating losses will be utilized.\nAt April 30, 2021, the Company had $\n361\nmillion of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, of which $\n81\nmillion have no expiration. The remaining loss carryforwards will expire during fiscal years 2022 through 2038. For U.S. state purposes, the Company had $\n1.4\nbillion of net operating loss carryforwards at April 30, 2021, $\n57\nmillion of which have no expiration. The remaining U.S. state loss carryforwards will expire during fiscal years 2022 through 2041.\nAt April 30, 2021, the Company also had $\n270\nmillion of tax credits available to reduce future income taxes payable, of which\n$\n107\nmillion have no expiration. The remaining credits will expire during fiscal years 2022 through 2041.\nThe Company has established valuation allowances of $\n5.8\nbillion and $\n5.5\nbillion at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020, respectively, primarily related to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets which are primarily comprised of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The increase in the valuation allowance during fiscal year 2021 is primarily related to the generation of certain net operating losses and the effects of currency fluctuations. These valuation allowances would result in a reduction to the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income if they are ultimately not required.\nThe Company’s effective income tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as follows:\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the net benefit from certain tax adjustments of $\n41\nmillion, recognized in\nincome tax provision (benefit)\nin the consolidated statements of income, included the following:\n•\nA net benefit of\n$\n106\nmillion associated with the resolution of an audit at the IRS Appellate level for fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014. The issues resolved relate to the utilization of certain net operating losses and the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for businesses that are not the subject of the U.S. Tax Court Case for fiscal years 2005 and 2006.\n•\nA net cost of\n$\n73\nmillion related to a tax basis adjustment of previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions. The cumulative amount of deferred tax benefit previously recognized from intercompany intellectual property transactions and recorded as Certain Tax Adjustments is $\n1.5\nbillion. The corresponding deferred tax assets will be amortized over a period of approximately\n20\nyears.\n91\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n•\nA cost of\n$\n50\nmillion associated with the amortization of the previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions.\n•\nA net cost of $\n25\nmillion associated with an internal restructuring and intercompany sale of assets.\n•\nA benefit of\n$\n83\nmillion related to the capitalization of certain research and development costs for U.S. income tax purposes and the establishment of a deferred tax asset at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the net benefit from certain tax adjustments of $\n1.2\nbillion, recognized in\nincome tax provision (benefit)\nin the consolidated statements of income, included the following:\n•\nA net benefit of\n$\n63\nmillion related to the finalization of certain state tax impacts from U.S. Tax Reform, and the issuance of certain final U.S. Treasury Regulations associated with U.S. Tax Reform. The primary impact of these regulations resulted in the Company re-establishing its permanently reinvested assertion on certain foreign earnings and reversing the previously accrued tax liability. This benefit was partially offset by additional tax associated with a previously executed internal reorganization of certain foreign subsidiaries.\n•\nA benefit of $\n252\nmillion related to tax legislative changes in Switzerland, which abolished certain preferential tax regimes the Company benefited from and replaced them with a new set of internationally accepted measures. The legislation provided for higher effective tax rates but allowed for a transitional period whereby an amortizable asset was created for Swiss federal income tax purposes that will be amortized and deducted over a\n10\n-year period.\n•\nA benefit of $\n658\nmillion related to the release of a valuation allowance previously recorded against certain net operating losses. Luxembourg enacted tax legislation during the year requiring the Company to reassess the realizability of certain net operating losses. The Company evaluated both the positive and negative evidence and released valuation allowance equal to the expected benefit from the utilization of certain net operating losses in connection with a planned intercompany sale of intellectual property.\n•\nA benefit of $\n269\nmillion associated with the intercompany sale of intellectual property and the establishment of a deferred tax asset.\nDuring fiscal year 2019, the net benefit from certain tax adjustments of $\n40\nmillion, recognized in\nincome tax provision (benefit)\nin the consolidated statements of income, included the following:\n•\nA net benefit of $\n30\nmillion associated with the finalization of the transition tax liability and the Tax Act impact to deferred tax assets, liabilities, and valuation allowances.\n•\nA charge of $\n42\nmillion related to the recognition of a prepaid tax expense resulting from the reduction in the U.S. statutory tax rate under the Tax Act and the current year sale of U.S. manufactured inventory held as of April 27, 2018.\n•\nA benefit of $\n32\nmillion related to intercompany legal entity restructuring.\n•\nA net benefit of $\n20\nmillion with the finalization of certain income tax aspects of the divestiture of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses.\nCurrently, the Company’s operations in Puerto Rico, Singapore, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and China have various tax holidays and tax incentive grants. The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rate favorably impacted earnings by $\n301\nmillion, $\n231\nmillion, and $\n437\nmillion in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, and diluted earnings per share by $\n0.22\n, $\n0.17\n, and $\n0.32\nin fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The tax holidays are conditional upon the Company meeting certain thresholds required under statutory law. The tax incentive grants, unless extended, will expire between fiscal years 2022 and 2030. The Company’s historical practice has been to renew, extend, or obtain new tax incentive grants upon expiration of existing tax incentive grants. If the Company is not able to renew, extend, or obtain new tax incentive grants, the expiration of existing tax incentive grants could have a material impact on the Company’s financial results in future periods. The tax incentive grants which expired during fiscal year 2021 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n92\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe Company had $\n1.7\nbillion, $\n1.9\nbillion, and $\n1.8\nbillion of gross unrecognized tax benefits at April 30, 2021, April 24, 2020, and April 26, 2019, respectively.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:\nIf all of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits at April 30, 2021, April 24, 2020, and April 26, 2019 were recognized, $\n1.6\nbillion, $\n1.8\nbillion, and $\n1.8\nbillion would impact the Company’s effective tax rate, respectively. Although the Company believes that it has adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate in future periods. The Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, net of cash advance, of $\n809\nmillion as a noncurrent liability. The Company estimates that within the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that its uncertain tax positions excluding interest, could decrease by as much as $\n14\nmillion, net as a result of statute of limitation lapses.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in\nincome tax provision\n(benefit)\nin the consolidated statements of income and records the liability in the current or noncurrent\naccrued income taxes\nin the consolidated balance sheets, as appropriate. The Company had $\n99\nmillion, $\n225\nmillion, and $\n172\nmillion of accrued gross interest and penalties at April 30, 2021, April 24, 2020, and April 26, 2019, respectively. During fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company recognized gross interest income of $\n44\nmillion, expense of $\n53\nmillion, and expense of $\n48\nmillion, respectively, in\nincome tax provision (benefit)\nin the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company reserves for uncertain tax positions related to unresolved matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities. These reserves are subject to a high degree of estimation and management judgment. Resolution of these significant unresolved matters, or positions taken by the IRS or other tax authorities during future tax audits, could have a material impact on the Company’s financial results in future periods. The Company continues to believe that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and that it has meritorious defenses for its tax filings and will vigorously defend them during the audit process, appellate process, and through litigation in courts, as necessary.\n93\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe major tax jurisdictions where the Company conducts business which remain subject to examination are as follows:\nSee Note 18 for additional information regarding the status of current tax audits and proceedings.\n14.\nEarnings Per Share\nEarnings per share is calculated using the two-class method, as the Company's A Preferred Shares are considered participating securities. Accordingly, earnings are allocated to both ordinary shares and participating securities in determining earnings per ordinary share. Due to the limited number of A Preferred Shares outstanding, this allocation had no effect on the ordinary earnings per share; therefore, it is not presented below. Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted number of ordinary shares outstanding, increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding had the potentially dilutive ordinary shares been issued, and reduced by the number of shares the Company could have repurchased with the proceeds from issuance of the potentially dilutive shares. Potentially dilutive ordinary shares include stock-based awards granted under stock-based compensation plans and shares committed to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan.\n94\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe table below sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\nThe calculation of weighted average diluted shares outstanding excludes options to purchase approximately\n4\nmillion,\n4\nmillion, and\n7\nmillion ordinary shares in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive on the Company’s earnings per share.\n15.\nRetirement Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors various retirement benefit plans, including defined benefit pension plans, post-retirement medical plans, defined contribution savings plans, and termination indemnity plans, covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the U.S. The net expense related to these plans was $\n668\nmillion, $\n467\nmillion, and $\n539\nmillion in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nIn the U.S., the Company maintain qualified pension plans designed to provide guaranteed minimum retirement benefits to all eligible U.S. participants. Pension coverage for non-U.S. employees is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. In addition to the benefits provided under the qualified pension plan, retirement benefits associated with wages in excess of the IRS allowable limits are provided to certain employees under a non-qualified plan. U.S. and Puerto Rico employees are also eligible to receive a medical benefit component, in addition to normal retirement benefits, through the Company’s post-retirement benefits.\nAt April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020, the net underfunded status of the Company’s benefit plans was $\n705\nmillion and $\n1.4\nbillion, respectively.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, as part of the Simplification restructuring program, the Company offered certain eligible U.S. employees voluntary early retirement packages, resulting in incremental expense of $\n97\nmillion recognized. Of this amount, $\n73\nmillion related to U.S. pension benefits, $\n11\nmillion related to defined contribution plans, $\n11\nmillion related to U.S. post-retirement benefits, and $\n2\nmillion related to cash payments and administrative fees. See Note 4 for additional information on the Simplification restructuring program.\nAs of April 24, 2020, the Company announced the freezing of U.S. pension benefits beginning in 2027. Employees will continue to earn benefits as required by the plan until April 30, 2027, after which date benefits will no longer be earned and employees will earn benefits under a new defined contribution structure. The Company recognized curtailment benefits of $\n94\nmillion in fiscal year 2020 as a result of this change.\n95\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nThe change in benefit obligation and funded status of the Company’s U.S. and Non-U.S. pension benefits are as follows:\n(1)\nActuarial gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions (such as changes in the discount rate and revised mortality rates). The actuarial losses in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were primarily related to decreases in discount rates.\n96\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nIn certain countries outside the U.S., fully funding pension plans is not a common practice, as funding provides no income tax benefit. Consequently, certain pension plans were partially funded at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020.\nU.S. and non-U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets consist of the following:\nU.S. and non-U.S. pension plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets consist of the following:\nThe net periodic benefit cost of the plans includes the following components:\nThe other changes in plan assets and projected benefit obligations recognized in\naccumulated other comprehensive loss\nfor fiscal year 2021 are as follows:\n97\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe actuarial assumptions are as follows:\nThe Company utilizes a full yield curve approach methodology to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit cost for the Company’s pension and other post-retirement benefits. The full yield curve approach applies specific spot rates along the yield curve to their underlying projected cash flows in estimation of the cost components. The current yield curves represent high quality, long-term fixed income instruments.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions are determined using a building block approach, considering historical averages and real returns of each asset class. In certain countries, where historical returns are not meaningful, consideration is given to local market expectations of long-term returns.\nRetirement Benefit Plan Investment Strategy\nThe Company sponsors trusts that hold the assets for U.S. pension plans and other U.S. post-retirement benefit plans, primarily retiree medical benefits. For investment purposes, the Medtronic U.S. pension and other U.S. post-retirement benefit plans employ similar investment strategies with different asset allocation targets.\nThe Company has a Qualified Plan Committee (the Plan Committee) that sets investment guidelines for U.S. pension plans and other U.S. post-retirement benefit plans with the assistance of external consultants. These guidelines are established based on market conditions, risk tolerance, funding requirements, and expected benefit payments. The Plan Committee also oversees the investment allocation process, selects the investment managers, and monitors asset performance. As pension liabilities are long-term in nature, the Company employs a long-term total return approach to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets for a prudent level of risk. An annual analysis on the risk versus the return of the investment portfolio is conducted to justify the expected long-term rate of return assumption.\nThe investment portfolios contain a diversified allocation of investment categories, including equities, fixed income securities, hedge funds, and private equity. Securities are also diversified in terms of domestic and international, short- and long-term, growth and value styles, large cap and small cap stocks, and active and passive management.\nOutside the U.S., pension plan assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees. There is significant variation in policy asset allocation from country to country. Local regulations, funding rules, and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. The weighted average target asset allocations at April 30, 2021 for the plans are\n40\n% equity securities,\n31\n% debt securities, and\n29\n% other.\nThe plans did not hold any investments in the Company’s ordinary shares at April 30, 2021 or April 24, 2020.\n98\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe Company’s U.S. plans target asset allocations at April 30, 2021, compared to the U.S. plans actual asset allocations at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020 by asset category, are as follows:\nStrong performance on equity securities during the fiscal year resulted in asset allocations different than targets. Management expects to move the allocations closer to target over the intermediate term.\nRetirement Benefit Plan Asset Fair Values\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for retirement benefit plan assets measured at fair value:\nShort-term investments:\nValued at the closing price reported in the active markets in which the individual security is traded.\nMutual funds:\nComprised of investments in equity and fixed income securities held in pooled investment vehicles. The valuations of mutual funds are based on the respective net asset values which are determined by the fund daily at market close. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets which are determined using observable inputs. The net asset values are publicly reported.\nEquity commingled trusts:\nComprised of investments in equity securities held in pooled investment vehicles. The valuations of equity commingled trusts are based on the respective net asset values which are determined by the fund daily at market close. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets which are determined using observable inputs. The net asset values are not publicly reported, and funds are valued at the net asset value practical expedient.\nFixed income commingled trusts:\nComprised of investments in fixed income securities held in pooled investment vehicles. The valuations of fixed income commingled trusts are based on the respective net asset values which are determined by the fund daily at market close. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets which are determined using observable inputs. The net asset values are not publicly reported, and funds are valued at the net asset value practical expedient.\nPartnership units:\nValued based on the year-end net asset values of the underlying partnerships. The net asset values of the partnerships are based on the fair values of the underlying investments of the partnerships. Quoted market prices are used to value the underlying investments of the partnerships, where the partnerships consist of the investment pools which invest primarily in common stocks. Partnership units include partnerships, private equity investments, and real asset investments. Partnerships primarily include long/short equity and absolute return strategies. These investments may be redeemed monthly with notice periods ranging from\n45\nto\n95\ndays. At April 30, 2021, there are\nno\nfunds in the process of liquidation. Private equity investments consist of common stock and debt instruments of private companies. For private equity funds, the sum of the unfunded commitments at April 30, 2021 is $\n171\nmillion, and the estimated liquidation period of these funds is expected to be\none\nto\n15\nyears. Real asset investments consist of commodities, derivatives, Real Estate Investment Trusts, and illiquid real estate holdings. These investments have redemption and liquidation periods ranging from\n30\ndays to\n10\nyears. At April 30, 2021, there are\nno\nreal estate investments in the process of liquidation. Valuation procedures are utilized to arrive at fair value if a quoted market price is not available for a partnership investment.\nRegistered investment companies:\nValued at net asset values which are not publicly reported. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets. The underlying assets are valued at the quoted market prices of shares held by the plan at year-end in the active market on which the individual securities are traded.\nInsurance contracts:\nComprised of investments in collective (group) insurance contracts, consisting of individual insurance policies. The policyholder is the employer, and each member is the owner/beneficiary of their individual insurance policy. These policies are a part of the insurance company’s general portfolio and participate in the insurer’s profit-sharing policy on an excess yield basis.\n99\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe methods described above may produce fair values that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nThe following tables provide information by level for the retirement benefit plan assets that are measured at fair value, as defined by U.S. GAAP. Certain investments for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient are not presented within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented for these investments are intended to permit reconciliation to the total fair value of plan assets at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020.\nU.S. Pension Benefits\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of U.S. pension benefit assets measured at fair value that used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):\n100\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nNon-U.S. Pension Benefits\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of non-U.S. pension benefit assets measured at fair value that used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):\nThere were no transfers into or out of Level 3 for both the U.S. and non-US pension plans during the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020.\nRetirement Benefit Plan Funding\nIt is the Company’s policy to fund retirement costs within the limits of allowable tax deductions. During fiscal year 2021, the Company made discretionary contributions of approximately $\n95\nmillion to the U.S. pension plan. Internationally, the Company contributed approximately $\n149\nmillion for pension benefits during fiscal year 2021. The Company anticipates that it will make contributions of $\n20\nmillion and $\n78\nmillion to its U.S. pension benefit plans and non-U.S. pension benefit plans, respectively, in fiscal year 2022. Based on the guidelines under the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the various guidelines which govern the plans outside the U.S., the majority of anticipated fiscal year 2022 contributions will be discretionary. The Company believes that pension assets, returns on invested pension assets, and Company contributions will be able to meet its pension and other post-retirement obligations in the future.\n101\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nRetiree benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are anticipated to be paid as follows:\nPost-retirement Benefit Plans\nThe net periodic benefit cost associated with the Company’s post-retirement benefit plans was income of $\n6\nmillion, $\n15\nmillion, and $\n17\nmillion in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The Company’s projected benefit obligation for all post-retirement benefit plans was $\n337\nmillion and $\n339\nmillion at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020, respectively. The Company’s fair value of plan assets for all post-retirement benefit plans was $\n345\nmillion and $\n296\nmillion at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020, respectively. The post-retirement benefit plan assets at both April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020 primarily comprised of equity and fixed commingled trusts, consistent with the U.S. retirement benefit plan assets outlined in the fair value leveling tables above.\nDefined Contribution Savings Plans\nThe Company has defined contribution savings plans that cover substantially all U.S. employees and certain non-U.S. employees. The general purpose of these plans is to provide additional financial security during retirement by providing employees with an incentive to make regular savings. Company contributions to the plans are based on employee contributions and Company performance. Expense recognized under these plans was $\n495\nmillion, $\n376\nmillion, and $\n415\nmillion in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nEffective May 1, 2005, the Company froze participation in the original defined benefit pension plan in the U.S. and implemented\ntwo\nnew plans: an additional defined benefit pension plan, the Personal Pension Account (PPA), and a new defined contribution plan, the Personal Investment Account (PIA). Employees in the U.S. hired on or after May 1, 2005 but before January 1, 2016 had the option to participate in either the PPA or the PIA. Participants in the PPA receive an annual allocation of their salary and bonus on which they will receive an annual guaranteed rate of return, which is based on the\nten-year\nTreasury bond rate. Participants in the PIA also receive an annual allocation of their salary and bonus; however, they are allowed to determine how to invest their funds among identified fund alternatives. The cost associated with the PPA is included in U.S. Pension Benefits in the tables presented earlier. The defined contribution cost associated with the PIA was approximately $\n50\nmillion, $\n52\nmillion, and $\n54\nmillion in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nEffective January 1, 2016, the Company froze participation in the existing defined benefit (PPA) and contribution (PIA) pension plans in the U.S. and implemented a new form of benefit under the existing defined contribution plan for legacy Covidien employees and employees in the U.S. hired on or after January 1, 2016 or rehired after July 1, 2020. Participants in the Medtronic Core Contribution (MCC) also receive an annual allocation of their salary and bonus and are allowed to determine how to invest their funds among identified fund alternatives. The defined contribution cost associated with the MCC was approximately $\n73\nmillion, $\n66\nmillion, and $\n58\nmillion and in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n16.\nLeases\nThe Company leases office, manufacturing, and research facilities and warehouses, as well as transportation, data processing, and other equipment. The Company determines whether a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception date. Upon commencement, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability. Right-of-use assets represent the Company's right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Lease liabilities are the Company's obligation to make the lease payments arising from a lease.\nAs the Company’s leases\ntypically do not provide an implicit rate, the Company’s lease liabilities are measured on a discounted basis using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. Lease terms used in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities include only options to extend the lease that are reasonably certain to be exercised. Additionally, lease terms underlying the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities consider terminations that are reasonably certain to be executed.\n102\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe Company's lease agreements include leases that have both lease and associated nonlease components. The Company has elected to account for lease components and the associated nonlease components as a single lease component. The consolidated balance sheets do not include recognized assets or liabilities for leases that, at the commencement date, have a term of twelve months or less and do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company recognizes such leases in the consolidated statements of income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Additionally, the Company recognizes variable lease payments not included in its lease liabilities in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Variable lease payments for fiscal year 2021 and 2020 were not material.\nThe Company's lease agreements include leases accounted for as operating leases and those accounted for as finance leases. The right-of-use assets, lease liabilities, lease costs, cash flows, and lease maturities associated with the Company's finance leases were not material to the consolidated financial statements at April 30, 2021 or April 24, 2020 or for fiscal year 2021 or 2020. Finance lease right-of-use assets are included in\nproperty, plant, and equipment, net\n, and finance lease liabilities are included in\ncurrent debt obligations\nand\nlong-term debt\non the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table summarizes the balance sheet classification of the Company's operating leases and amounts of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020:\nThe following table summarizes the weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate for the Company's operating leases at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020:\nThe following table summarizes the components of total operating lease cost for fiscal year 2021 and 2020:\nRent expense for all operating leases was $\n305\nmillion in fiscal year 2019.\nThe following table summarizes the cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities for fiscal year 2021 and 2020:\n103\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the maturities of the Company's operating leases at April 30, 2021:\nThe Company makes certain products available to customers under lease arrangements, including arrangements whereby equipment is placed with customers who then purchase consumable products to accompany the use of the equipment. Income arising from arrangements where the Company is the lessor is recognized within\nnet sales\nin the consolidated statements of income and the Company's net investments in sales-type leases are included in\nother current assets\nand\nother assets\nin the consolidated balance sheets. Lessor income and the related assets and lease maturities were not material to the consolidated financial statements at or for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021 and April 30, 2021.\n104\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\n17.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following table provides changes in AOCI, net of tax and by component:\n(1) The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in fiscal year 2019 resulted from the adoption of accounting guidance that requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.\nThe income tax on gains and losses on investment securities in other comprehensive income before reclassifications during fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was an expense of $\n31\nmillion, a benefit of $\n13\nmillion and a benefit of $\n5\nmillion, respectively. Realized gains and losses on investment securities reclassified from AOCI were reduced by income taxes of $\n2\nmillion for fiscal year 2021 and $\n3\nmillion for fiscal years 2020 and 2019. When realized, gains and losses on investment securities reclassified from AOCI are recognized within\nother non-operating income, net\n.

Refer to Note 7 for additional information.\n18.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nLegal Matters\nThe Company and its affiliates are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability, intellectual property and commercial disputes, shareholder related matters, environmental proceedings, tax disputes, and governmental proceedings and investigations, including those described below. With respect to governmental proceedings and investigations, like other companies in our industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by national, state, and local governmental agencies in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate. As a result, interaction with governmental agencies is ongoing. The Company’s standard practice is to cooperate with regulators and investigators in responding to inquiries. The outcomes of legal actions are not within the Company’s complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages, as well as other civil or criminal remedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could require significant expenditures, result in lost revenues, or limit the Company's ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions.\nThe Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements on an undiscounted basis for loss contingencies related to legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required. Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery, involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages, potentially involve penalties, fines or punitive damages, or could result in a change in business practice. The Company classifies litigation charges and gains related to significant legal matters as certain litigation charges. During fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company recognized $\n118\nmillion, $\n313\nmillion, and $\n166\nmillion, respectively, of certain litigation charges. At April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020, accrued litigation was approximately $\n0.4\nbillion and $\n0.5\nbillion, respectively. The ultimate cost to the Company with respect to accrued litigation could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. The Company includes accrued litigation in\nother accrued expenses\nand\nother liabilities\non the consolidated balance sheets. While it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the legal matters discussed below, the Company believes it is possible that the costs associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.\nProduct Liability Matters\nPelvic Mesh Litigation\nThe Company is currently involved in litigation in various state and federal courts against manufacturers of pelvic mesh products alleging personal injuries resulting from the implantation of those products.\nTwo\nsubsidiaries of Covidien supplied pelvic mesh products to\none\nof the manufacturers, C.R. Bard (Bard), named in the litigation. The litigation includes a federal multi-district litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia and cases in various state courts and jurisdictions outside the U.S. Generally, complaints allege design and manufacturing claims, failure to warn, breach of warranty, fraud, violations of state consumer protection laws and loss of consortium claims. In fiscal year 2016, Bard paid the Company $\n121\nmillion towards the settlement of\n11,000\nof these claims. In May 2017, the agreement with Bard was amended to extend the terms to apply to up to an additional\n5,000\nclaims. That agreement does not resolve the dispute between the Company and Bard with respect to claims that do not settle, if any. As part of the agreement, the Company and Bard agreed to dismiss without prejudice their pending litigation with respect to Bard’s obligation to defend and indemnify the Company. The Company estimates law firms representing approximately\n16,200\nclaimants have asserted or may assert claims involving products manufactured by Covidien’s subsidiaries. As of June 2, 2021, the Company had reached agreements to settle approximately\n15,900\nof these claims. The Company's accrued expenses for this matter are included within accrued litigation as discussed above.\n106\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nHernia Mesh Litigation\nStarting in fiscal year 2020, plaintiffs filed lawsuits against certain subsidiaries of the Company in U.S. state and federal courts alleging personal injury from hernia mesh products sold by those subsidiaries. The majority of the pending cases are in Massachusetts state court, where they have been consolidated before a single judge. Certain plaintiffs' law firms have advised the Company that they may file a large volume of additional cases in the future. The pending lawsuits relate almost entirely to hernia mesh products that have not been subject to recalls, withdrawals or other adverse regulatory action. The Company has not recorded an expense related to damages in connection with these matters because any potential loss is not currently probable or reasonably estimable under U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters.\nPatent Litigation\nEthicon\nOn December 14, 2011, Ethicon filed an action against Covidien in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, alleging patent infringement and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. On January 22, 2014, the district court entered summary judgment in Covidien's favor, and the majority of this ruling was affirmed by the Federal Circuit on August 7, 2015. Following appeal, the case was remanded back to the District Court with respect to\none\npatent. On January 21, 2016, Covidien filed a second action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, seeking a declaration of non-infringement with respect to a second set of patents held by Ethicon. The court consolidated this second action with the remaining patent issues from the first action. Following consolidation of the cases, Ethicon dismissed\nsix\nof the asserted patents, leaving a single asserted patent. In March 2021, the consolidated action was dismissed with prejudice, pursuant to a settlement agreement.\nSasso\nThe Company is involved in litigation in Indiana relating to certain patent and royalty disputes with Dr. Sasso under agreements originally entered into in 1999 and 2001. On November 28, 2018, a jury in Indiana state court returned a verdict against the Company for approximately $\n112\nmillion. On June 15, 2021, pursuant to an order from the state court, the Company paid the judgment plus accrued interest to Dr. Sasso, subject to repayment if the Company's ongoing appeal is successful.\nShareholder Related Matters\nCovidien Acquisition\nOn July 2, 2014, Lewis Merenstein filed a putative shareholder class action in Hennepin County, Minnesota, District Court seeking to enjoin the then-potential acquisition of Covidien. The lawsuit named Medtronic, Inc., Covidien, and each member of the Medtronic, Inc. Board of Directors at the time as defendants, and alleged that the directors breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders with regard to the then-potential acquisition. On August 21, 2014, Kenneth Steiner filed a putative shareholder class action in Hennepin County, Minnesota, District Court, also seeking an injunction to prevent the potential Covidien acquisition. In September 2014, the\nMerenstein\nand\nSteiner\nmatters were consolidated. In April 2021, the parties reach an agreement to resolve this matter, bringing it to a conclusion.\nEnvironmental Proceedings\nThe Company is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. These projects relate to a variety of activities, including removal of solvents, metals and other hazardous substances from soil and groundwater. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash flows is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.\nThe Company is a successor to a company which owned and operated a chemical manufacturing facility in Orrington, Maine from 1967 until 1982, and is responsible for the costs of completing an environmental site investigation as required by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MDEP). MDEP served a compliance order on Mallinckrodt LLC and U.S. Surgical Corporation, subsidiaries of Covidien, in December 2008, which included a directive to remove a significant volume of soils at the site. After a hearing on the compliance order before the Maine Board of Environmental Protection (Maine Board) to challenge the terms of the compliance order, the Maine Board modified the MDEP order and issued a final order requiring removal of\ntwo\nlandfills, capping of the remaining\nthree\nlandfills, installation of a groundwater extraction system and long-term monitoring of the site and the\nthree\nremaining landfills.\n107\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nThe Company has proceeded with implementation of the investigation and remediation at the site in accordance with the MDEP order as modified by the Maine Board order.\nSince the early 2000s, the Company or its predecessors have also been involved in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Maine People’s Alliance. Plaintiffs sought an injunction requiring the Company's predecessor to conduct extensive studies of mercury contamination of the Penobscot River and Bay and options for remediating such contamination, and to perform appropriate remedial activities, if necessary.\nFollowing a trial in March 2002, the Court held that conditions in the Penobscot River and Bay may pose an imminent and substantial endangerment and that the Company’s predecessor was liable for the cost of performing a study of the River and Bay. Following a second trial in June 2014, the Court ordered that further engineering study and engineering design work was needed to determine the nature and extent of remediation in the Penobscot River and Bay. The Court also appointed an engineering firm to conduct such studies and issue a report on potential remediation alternatives. In connection with these proceedings, reports have been produced including a variety of cost estimates for a variety of potential remedial options. In March 2021, the parties notified the Court that they had agreed on a settlement in principle of all issues in this matter. Finalization of the proposed settlement remains subject to a fairness hearing and Court approval.\nThe Company's accrued expenses for environmental proceedings are included within accrued litigation as discussed above.\nIncome Taxes\nIn March 2009, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some, but not all matters related to these fiscal years. The remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico, which is one of the Company's key manufacturing sites. The U.S. Tax Court reviewed this dispute, and on June 9, 2016, issued its opinion with respect to the allocation of income between the parties for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. The U.S. Tax Court generally rejected the IRS’s position, but also made certain modifications to the Medtronic, Inc. tax returns as filed. On April 21, 2017, the IRS filed their Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit regarding the Tax Court Opinion. Oral argument for the Appeal occurred on March 14, 2018. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals issued their opinion on August 16, 2018 and remanded the case back to the U.S. Tax Court for additional factual findings. The U.S. Tax Court trial was held in June 2021.\nIn October 2011, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some, but not all matters related to these fiscal years. The remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the businesses that are the subject of the U.S. Tax Court Case for fiscal years 2005 and 2006.\nIn April 2014, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some but not all matters related to these fiscal years. The remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2009, 2010, and 2011 relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the businesses that are the subject of the U.S. Tax Court Case for fiscal years 2005 and 2006.\nIn May 2017, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some but not all matters related to these fiscal years. During January 2021, Medtronic, Inc. and the IRS resolved the outstanding matters related to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the businesses that are not the subject of the U.S. Tax Court Case and the utilization of certain net operating losses.\nThe remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2014 relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the businesses that are the subject of the U.S. Tax Court Case for fiscal years 2005 and 2006.\nIn November 2020, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2015 and 2016. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some but not all matters related to these fiscal years. The significant issue that remains unresolved relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the businesses that are the subject of the U.S. Tax Court Case for fiscal years 2005 and 2006.\nMedtronic, Inc.’s fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently being audited by the IRS.\n108\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nIn January 2021, the IRS issued its audit report for Covidien's fiscal year 2015 U.S. federal income tax returns.\nCovidien reached agreement with the IRS on all matters related to fiscal year 2015. The statute of limitations for Covidien's 2016 and 2017 U.S. federal income tax returns lapsed during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nWhile it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the income tax matters discussed above, the Company believes it is possible that charges associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.\nSee Note 13 for additional discussion of income taxes.\nGuarantees\nAs part of the Company’s sale of the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses to Cardinal on July 29, 2017, the Company has indemnified Cardinal for certain contingent tax liabilities related to the divested businesses that existed prior to the date of divestiture. The actual amounts that the Company may be required to ultimately accrue or pay could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company and/or its affiliates periodically enter into agreements that require one or more of the Company and/or its affiliates to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising as a result of the Company or its affiliates’ products, the negligence of the Company's personnel, or claims alleging that the Company's products infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property. The Company also offers warranties on various products. The Company’s maximum exposure under these guarantees is unable to be estimated. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of guarantees.\nThe Company believes the ultimate resolution of the above guarantees is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.\n19.\nSegment and Geographic Information\nEffective February 1, 2021, the Company implemented a new operating model, moving from a Group structure to a Portfolio structure: Cardiovascular Portfolio (formerly Cardiac and Vascular Group), Neuroscience Portfolio (formerly Restorative Therapies Group), and Medical Surgical Portfolio (formerly Minimally Invasive Therapies Group). The Diabetes Operating Unit (formerly Diabetes Group) remains a separate operating and reportable segment in the new structure. There were no changes to the reportable segments during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, such that the\nfour\nprincipal operating and reportable segments are as follows: Cardiovascular Portfolio, Neuroscience Portfolio, Medical Surgical Portfolio, and Diabetes Operating Unit.\nThe Company's management has chosen to organize the entity based upon therapy solutions provided by each segment. The\nfour\nprincipal segments are strategic businesses that are managed separately, as each one develops and manufactures products and provides services oriented toward targeted therapy solutions.\nThe primary products and services from which the Cardiovascular Portfolio segment derives its revenues include products for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of cardiac rhythm disorders and cardiovascular disease, as well as services to diagnose, treat, and manage heart and vascular-related disorders and diseases.\nThe primary products and services from which the Medical Surgical Portfolio segment derives its revenues include those focused on diseases of the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, renal system, lungs, pelvic region, kidneys, obesity, and other preventable complications.\nThe primary products and services from which the Neuroscience Portfolio segment derives its revenues include those focused on neurostimulation therapies and drug delivery systems for the treatment of chronic pain, as well as various areas of the spine and brain, along with pelvic health and conditions of the ear, nose, and throat.\nThe primary products from which the Diabetes Operating Unit segment derives its revenues include those focused on diabetes management, including insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring systems, smart insulin pens, and insulin pump consumables.\n109\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nSegment disclosures are on a performance basis, consistent with internal management reporting. Net sales of the Company's segments include end-customer revenues from the sale of products the segment develops, manufactures, and distributes. There are certain corporate and centralized expenses that are not allocated to the segments. The Company's management evaluates the performance of the segments and allocates resources based on net sales and segment operating profit. Segment operating profit represents income before income taxes, excluding interest expense, amortization of intangible assets, centralized distribution costs, non-operating income or expense items, certain corporate charges, and other items not allocated to the segments.\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1. Certain depreciable assets may be recorded by one segment, while the depreciation expense is allocated to another segment. The allocation of depreciation expense is based on the proportion of the assets used by each segment.\nSegment Operating Profit\nTotal Assets and Depreciation Expense\n110\nMedtronic plc\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)\nGeographic Information\nNet sales are attributed to the country based on the location of the customer taking possession of the products or in which the services are rendered. Geographic property, plant, and equipment are attributed to the country based on the physical location of the assets.\nThe following table presents net sales for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, and property, plant, and equipment, net at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020 for the Company's country of domicile, countries with significant concentrations, and all other countries:\nNo single customer represented over 10 percent of the Company’s consolidated net sales in fiscal years 2021, 2020, or 2019.\n20.\nSubsequent Events\nOn June 3, 2021, the Company announced the decision to stop the distribution and sale of the Medtronic HVAD System in light of a growing body of observational clinical comparisons indicating a lower frequency of neurological adverse events and mortality with another circulatory support device available to patients compared to the HVAD system. Fiscal year 2021 HVAD system and associated accessory revenue was $\n141\nmillion and is included in our Cardiovascular segment. The Company expects to record a non-cash pre-tax impairment of long-lived assets of $\n400\nmillion to $\n500\nmillion in the quarter ending July 30, 2021 primarily related to intangible assets. The Company remains committed to serving the needs of the\n4,000\npatients currently implanted with this device.\n111"

Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are effective.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective at April 30, 2021. The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in “Item 8.

The activities described herein are expressly authorized by the U.S. Government under applicable economic sanctions regulations.\nSpecifically, Medtronic’s affiliate in Russia, Medtronic Russia LLC (“Medtronic Russia”), is required under Russian law to complete certain notification and filing requirements to Russia’s Federal Security Service (“FSB”) regarding certain Medtronic medical devices that make use of encryption functionality that are imported into Russia. While the FSB has been included on the Specially Designated Nationals (“SDN”) List administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), these activities are and remain authorized. In particular, Cyber General License No. 1B (“Cyber GL 1B”), issued by OFAC, authorizes all transactions ordinarily incident to obtaining such permits from the FSB, provided that certain conditions are met.\nHistorically, Medtronic has not been required to disclose these lawful dealings with the FSB. However, on March 2, 2021, OFAC designated the FSB pursuant to an additional sanctions authority. While OFAC amended the applicable general license to confirm that all previously authorized dealings with the FSB remain authorized (notwithstanding the additional designation), the designation of the FSB with a [NPWMD] tag pursuant to Executive Order 13382 means that Medtronic is required under Section 13(r)(1)(D)(ii) of the Securities Exchange Act to disclose certain information as a result of this additional designation, as Section 13(r)(1)(D)(ii) does not contain an exception from its reporting requirements for activities that are authorized by the U.S. Government.\nSince March 2, 2021, in the normal course of business and consistent with the authorization of Cyber GL 1B, Medtronic Russia filed five notifications with the FSB, as required under local Russian law for the import of medical devices that make use of encryption functionality. These activities did not directly result in any revenues or profits for Medtronic. Medtronic intends to continue engaging in activities for which it is authorized by Cyber GL 1B (or any successor GL), to the extent necessary to comply with local law requirements in Russia.\n112\nPART III\nPart III of this Annual Report on Form 10-K incorporates information by reference from the Company's 2021 definitive proxy statement, which will be filed no later than 120 days after April 30, 2021."
