However, the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters or other events. In fiscal 2021, market price volatility for certain materials, most notably the price of steel, negatively impacted the Company's profitability. The Company also navigated supply chain disruptions and experienced higher freight costs. Despite these challenging conditions, the raw materials and various purchased components needed for the Company’s products have generally been available in sufficient quantities. See Item 7 - “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\n5\nPATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES\nThe Company maintains an intellectual property portfolio it has developed or acquired over a number of years, including patents, trademarks and licenses. The Company also continues to develop or acquire new intellectual propert\ny. New patent applications are continuously filed to protect the Company’s ongoing research and development activities. The Company’s trademark registrations may be renewed and their duration is dependent upon national laws and trademark use. While this proprietary intellectual property portfolio is important to the Company in the aggregate, management does not regard any of its segments as being dependent on any single patent, trademark registration or license.\nBACKLOG\nThe Company’s estimated consolidated order backlog was $6.5 billion and $5.3 billion at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Approximately 85 percent of the Company’s consolidated backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, with the remainder substantially over the subsequent two years thereafter. Backlog by business at September 30, 2021 and 2020 follows (dollars in millions):\nCOMPETITION\nThe Company's businesses operate in highly competitive markets. The Company competes based on product performance, quality, branding, service and/or price across the industries and markets served. A significant element of the Company's competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high-quality products at the best relevant global cost. Although no single company competes directly with Emerson in all of the Company's product lines, various companies compete in one or more product lines with the number of competitors varying by product line. Some competitors have substantially greater sales, assets and financial resources than Emerson and the Company also competes with many smaller companies. Management believes Emerson has a market leadership position in many of its product lines.\nREGULATIONS\nThe Company's operations, products and services are subject to various government regulations, including environmental regulations. Our manufacturing locations generate waste, of which treatment, storage, transportation and disposal are subject to U.S. federal, state, foreign and/or local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment. The Company continually works to minimize the environmental impact of its operations through safe technologies, facility design and operating procedures. Compliance with government regulations, including environmental regulations, has not had, and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures (including expenditures for environmental control facilities), earnings or competitive position. However, laws and regulations may be changed, accelerated or adopted that impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company and which could negatively impact our operating results. See Item 1A - \"Risk Factors.\"\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSupporting our people is a core value for Emerson and underpins our corporate culture. We believe the Company’s success depends on its ability to attract, develop and retain key personnel, and we hired our first Chief People Officer, Elizabeth Adefioye, to help ensure the Company remains focused on this goal. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of key employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. The Company's Board of Directors and management oversee various employee initiatives.\nThe Company supports and develops its employees through global training and development programs that build and strengthen employees’ leadership and professional skills. Leadership development programs include intensive\n6\nlearning programs for new leaders as well as more established leaders. The Company also partners with educational institutions and nonprofit organizations to help prepare current and future workers with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed. To assess and improve employee retention and engagement, the Company surveys employees with the assistance of third-party consultants, and takes actions to address areas of employee concern. Approximately 45,000 employees were surveyed during the three years ended September 30, 2021.\nEmployee health and safety in the workplace is also one of the Company’s core values. Safety efforts are led by the Corporate Safety Council and supported by health and safety committees that operate at the local site level. Hazards in the workplace are actively identified and management tracks incidents so remedial actions can be taken to improve workplace safety. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, the Company has taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect our workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work.\nWe have identified other human capital priorities, including, among other things, providing competitive wages and benefit\ns and promoting an inclusive work environment. The Company is committed to efforts to increase diversity and foster an inclusive work environment that supports our large global workforce and helps us innovate for our customers. We also have taken actions to enhance diversity, including recruiting at venues representing women, minorities and U.S. military veterans. In 2021, the Company introduced diversity goals at the leadership level. Our efforts are guided by our Chief Executive Officer and Diversity Council, which is comprised of 14 senior-level executives.\nEmployee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. The Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 86,700 employees at September 30, 2021. Management believes that the Company's employee relations are favorable.\nA small portion of the Company’s U.S. employees are unionized, while outside the U.S., we have employees in certain countries, particularly in Europe, that are represented by an employee representative organization, such as a union, works council or employee association.\nENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY\nEmerson’s global purpose is to drive innovation that makes the world healthier, safer, smarter and more sustainable. Our environmental sustainability strategy is focused on driving progress within our facilities and helping our customers achieve their ESG objectives. In 2019, we made a commitment to reduce our GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions by 20 percent, normalized to sales, across our entire global manufacturing footprint and shared service facilities by 2028, measured by our baseline year of 2018. In 2020, we formed the Environmental Sustainability Steering Committee to further our efforts to drive environmentally responsible solutions for the Company and the industries we serve. And in early 2021, we named Mike Train as our first Chief Sustainability Officer.\nOur environmental sustainability strategy is summarized by our “Greening Of, Greening By, Greening With” framework.\nGreening Of Emerson\ndemonstrates our efforts to improve our internal environmental sustainability performance, including reducing our GHG emissions and energy and water consumption.\nGreening By Emerson\nis our approach to delivering technology, solutions and expertise (including through our software offerings) that support and enable our customers’ decarbonization and environmental sustainability efforts.\nGreening With Emerson\nreflects how we foster collaboration among stakeholders by participating in environmental sustainability industry forums, partnering to develop innovative solutions, and engaging with governments globally to support sustainability-related policies and regulations.\nEmerson’s environmental sustainability initiatives and strategy are discussed further in our 2020 Environmental, Social and Governance Report, which can be found on our website at www.Emerson.com; this report is not incorporated by reference and should not be considered part of this Form 10-K.\n7\nINTERNET ACCESS\nEmerson's reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and all amendments to those reports, as well as proxy statements, are available without charge through the Company’s website on the internet as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

    "text": "Investing in our securities involves risks. You should carefully consider, among other matters, the factors set forth below and the other information in this report. The Company’s risk factors set forth below are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial also may materially, adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or operating results. We may amend or supplement the risk factors set forth below from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nWe Operate in Businesses That Are Subject to Competitive Pressures That Could Affect Prices or Demand for Our Products\nOur businesses operate in markets that are highly competitive and potentially volatile, and we compete on the basis of product performance, quality, service and/or price across the industries and markets served. Our businesses are largely dependent on the current and future business environment, including capital and consumer spending. A significant element of our competitive strategy is to deliver solutions to our customers by manufacturing high-quality products at the best relevant global cost. Various companies compete with us in one or more product lines and the number of competitors varies by product line. Some of our competitors have substantially greater sales, assets and financial resources than our Company and we also compete with many smaller companies. Competitive pressures could adversely affect prices or customer demand for our products, impacting our sales or profit margins, and/or resulting in a loss of market share.\nOur Operating Results Depend in Part on Continued Successful Research, Development and Marketing of New and/or Improved Products and Services, and There Can Be No Assurance That We Will Continue to Successfully Introduce New Products and Services\nThe success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Our businesses are affected by varying degrees of technological change and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of bein\ng first to market with new products and services. We may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services which may negatively impact our operating results and prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market.\nWe must anticipate and respond to market and technological changes driven by broader trends such as decarbonization and electrification efforts in response to climate change. Market growth from the use of cleaner energy sources, as well as emissions management, energy efficiency, lower greenhouse gas refrigerant usage, and decarbonization efforts are likely to depend in part on technologies not yet deployed or widely adopted today. We may not adequately innovate or position our businesses for the adoption of technologies such as battery storage solutions, hydrogen use cases in industry, mobility, and power generation, enhanced electrical grid demand management, carbon capture and sequestration or advanced nuclear power.\nThese trends and the relative competitiveness of our product and service offerings will continue to be impacted by uncertain factors such as the pace of technological developments and related cost considerations, the levels of economic growth in different markets around the world and the adoption of climate change-related policies such as carbon taxes, greenhouse gas emission reductions, incentives or mandates for particular types of energy, or policies that impact the availability of financing for certain types of projects.\n8\nIf We Are Unable to Defend or Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights, the Company's Competitive Position Could Be Adversely Affected\nThe Company's intellectual property rights are important to its business and include numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other confidential information. This intellectual property may be subject to challenge, infringement, invalidation or circumvention by third parties. Despite extensive security measures, our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems, employee theft, or other acts of industrial espionage. Should the Company be unable to adequately defend or protect its intellectual property, it may suffer competitive harm.\nWe Engage in Acquisitions and Divestitures, Which Are Subject to Domestic and Foreign Regulatory Requirements, and May Encounter Difficulties in Integrating and Separating These Businesses and Therefore We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits\nWe regularly seek growth through strategic acquisitions as well as evaluate our portfolio for potential divestitures. These activities require favorable environments to execute these transactions, and we may encounter difficulties in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions. In 2021 and in past years, we have made various acquisitions and entered into joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business, and may continue to do so in the future. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to cooperate with our strategic partners. We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations as well as separating divested businesses, and in managing strategic investments. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree, or timing, of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe Planned Combination of Two of Our Industrial Software Businesses (OSI Inc. and the Geological Simulation Software businesses) with the Business of Aspen Technology, Inc., and our Planned Majority Stake in the Publicly Traded Entity that Holds Such Combined Businesses, May Not Be Completed Within the Currently Contemplated Time Frame, With the Expected Terms or Costs, and May Not Achieve the Intended Benefits\nWe make no assurance regarding the terms, timing, costs or benefits anticipated from the planned combination with Aspen Technology, Inc. (\"AspenTech\"). Unforeseen developments, including possible delays in obtaining various regulatory and other approvals, could delay the proposed transaction, or cause it to occur on terms and conditions that are less favorable, or at a higher cost, than expected.\nFurther, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial or other benefits of the planned combination.\nCompletion of the proposed AspenTech transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including among other things, the receipt of approval from AspenTech's stockholders and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, which make the completion and timing of the proposed transaction uncertain. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could delay the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the proposed transaction for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the proposed AspenTech transaction will be satisfied or waived or that the proposed transaction will be completed.\nWe Use a Variety of Raw Materials and Components in Our Businesses, and Significant Shortages or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs and Adversely Impact t\nhe Competitive Positions of Our Products\nOur major requirements for raw materials include steel, copper, cast iron, electronics, rare earth metals, aluminum, brass and, to a lesser extent, plastics and petroleum-based chemicals. The Company seeks multiple sources of supply for each of its major requirements in order to avoid significant dependence on any one or a few suppliers. However, the supply of materials or other items could be disrupted by natural disasters, a health epidemic or pandemic, or other events. Significant shortages or price increases could impact the prices our affected businesses charge, their operating costs and the competitive position of their products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations. While we monitor market prices of the commodities we require and attempt to mitigate price exposure through hedging activities, this risk could adversely affect our operating results.\n9\nOur Operations Depend on Production Facilities Throughout the World, a Majority of Which Are Located Outside the United States and Subject to Increased Risks of Disrupted Production, Causing Delays in Shipments and Loss of Customers and Revenue\nWe manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide, a majority of which are located outside the United States, and also source certain materials internationally. Emerging market sales represent over one-third of total sales and serving a global customer base requires that we place more materials sourcing and production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and maintain our best-cost position. Our and our suppliers’ international production facilities and operations could b\ne disrupted by weather and natural disaster (including the potential effects of climate change), labor strife, war, political unrest, terrorist activity or public health concerns such as an epidemic or pandemic, particularly in emerging countries that are not well-equip\nped to handle such occurrences.\nOur manufacturing facilities abroad are dependent on the stability of governments and business conditions and may be more susceptible to changes in laws, policies and regulations in host countries, as well as economic and political upheaval, than our domestic facilities. These facilities face increased risks of nationalization as well as operational disruptions which could cause delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us.\nAccess to Funding Through the Capital Markets is Essential to the Execution of Our Business Plan, and if We Are Unable to Maintain Such Access We Could Experience a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business and Financial Results\nOur ability to invest in our businesses, make strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations requires access to the capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support short-term borrowings. Volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments, or affect the Company’s ability to access those markets. If we are unable to continue to access the capital markets, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Additionally, if our customers, suppliers or financial institutions are unable to access the capital markets to meet their commitments to the Company, our business could be adversely impacted.\nOur Business Success Depends on the Ability to Attract, Develop and Retain Key Personnel\nOur success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our management and key employees. Their skills, experience and industry knowledge significantly benefit our operations and performance. The failure to attract, develop and retain highly qualified personnel could adversely affect our ability to succeed in our human capital goals and priorities as well as negatively impact our business and operating results.\nSecurity and/or Data Privacy Breaches, or Disruptions of Our Information Technology Systems Could Adversely Affect Our Business\nThe Company relies on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. These technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; telecommunications or system failures; terrorist attacks; natural disasters; employee error or malfeasance; server or cloud provider breaches; and computer viruses or cyberattacks. Cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology networks and systems to more sophisticated and targeted measures, known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third-party service providers. Despite the implementation of cybersecurity measures (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring, and maintenance of backup and protective systems), the Company’s information technology systems may still be vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and other electronic security breaches. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended\nperiod. In addition, it is possible a security breach could result in theft of trade secrets or other intellectual property or disclosure of confidential customer, supplier or employee information. Should the Company be unable to prevent security breaches or other damage to our information technology systems, disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations, as well as expose the Company to litigation, liability or penalties under privacy laws, increased cybersecurity protection costs, reputational damage and product failure. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business\n10\nand personal data in the U.S. and elsewhere. Compliance with privacy and localization laws and regulations increases operational complexity. Failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to fines and penalties, as well as legal and reputational risks, including proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others.\nOur Products and Services are Highly Sophisticated and Specialized, and a Major Product Failure or Similar Event Caused by Defects, Cybersecurity Incidents or Other Failures, Could Adversely Affect Our Business, Reputation, Financial Position and Results of Operations\nWe produce highly sophisticated products and provide specialized services that incorporate or use complex or leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Many of our products and services, including measurement and analytical instrumentation, industrial valves and equipment, and process control systems, are integrated and used in complex process, hybrid and discrete manufacturing environments. As a result, the impact of a catastrophic product failure or similar event could be significant. While we have built operational processes to ensure that our product design, manufacture, performance and servicing meet rigorous quality standards, there can be no assurance that we or our customers or other third parties will not experience operational process or product failures and other problems, including through manufacturing or design defects, process or other failures of contractors or third-party suppliers, cybersecurity incidents or other intentional acts, that could result in potential product, safety, regulatory or environmental risks. Cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software embedded in our products could lead to third-party claims resulting from damages caused by our product failures, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nIndustry and General Economic Risks\nThe Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak Has Adversely Impacted our Business and Could in the Future Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Business, Results of Operation, Financial Condition and Liquidity, the Nature and Extent of Which is Highly Uncertain\nThe global outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has significantly increased economic, demand and operational uncertainty. We have global operations, customers and suppliers, including in countries most impacted by COVID-19. Authorities around the world have taken a variety of measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans or restrictions, increased border controls or closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns and such authorities may impose additional restrictions. We have also taken actions to protect our employees and to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including embracing guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on social distancing, good hygiene, restrictions on employee travel and in-person meetings, and changes to employee work arrangements including remote work arrangements where appropriate. Evolving government plans around the world to institute vaccination mandates, including in the U.S., create uncertainty that may impact our employees and result in labor shortages and unforeseen costs, which could negatively affect our results. These actions have and may continue to impact our employees, customers and suppliers, and future developments could cause further disruptions to Emerson due to the interconnected nature of our business relationships.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and our customers, as well as volatility in commodity markets (including oil prices), has negatively impacted demand for our products and could continue to do so in the future. Its effects could also result in further disruptions to our manufacturing operations, including higher rates of employee absenteeism, and supply chain, which could continue to negatively impact our ability to meet customer demand. Additionally, the potential deterioration and volatility of credit and financial markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the spread and duration of the virus, potential actions taken by governmental authorities, and how quickly economic conditions stabilize and recover.\n11\nOur Substantial Sales Both in the U.S. and Abroad Subject Us to Economic Risk as Our Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in Government Regulations and Policies and Currency Fluctuations\nWe sell, manufacture, engineer and purchase products globally, with significant sales in both mature and emerging markets. We expect sales in non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales. Our U.S. and international operations subject the Company to changes in government regulations and policies in a large number of jurisdictions around the world, including those related to trade, investments, taxation, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, trade restrictions or barriers, tariffs or taxes, trade protection measures, and retaliatory countermeasures, including on imports from countries where we manufacture products, could adversely impact our business and financial results. In addition, changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and have affected our operating results and could do so in the future. While we monitor our exchange rate exposures and attempt to mitigate this exposure through hedging activities, this risk could adversely affect our operating results.\nRecessions, Adverse Market Conditions or Downturns in End Markets We Serve May Negatively Affect Our Operations\nIn th\ne past, our operations have been exposed to significant volatility due to changes in general economic conditions or consumer preferences, recessions or adverse conditions in the end markets we serve. In the future, similar changes could adversely impact overall sales, operating results (including potential impairment charges for goodwill or other long-lived assets) and cash flows. Moreover, during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive restructuring actions, including workforce reductions, global facility consolidations, centralization of certain business support activities, and other cost reduction initiatives, and incur higher costs. As these plans and actions can be complex, the anticipated operational improvements, efficiencies and other benefits might be delayed or not realized.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nChanges in Tax Rates, Laws or Regulations and the Resolution of Tax Disputes Could Adversely Impact Our Financial Results\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine our consolidated income tax provision and related liabilities. The Company’s effective tax rate, cash flows and operating results could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, as well as by changes in the local tax laws and regulations, or the interpretations thereof. In addition, the Company’s tax returns are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities. While we believe our tax provisions are appropriate, the final outcome of tax audits or disputes could result in adjustments to the Company’s tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur Reputation, Ability To Do Business and Results of Operations Could Be Impaired By Improper Conduct By Any of Our Employees, Agents or Business Partners\nWe are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including laws related to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export and import compliance, anti-trust and money laundering, due to our global operations. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced government corruption to some degree. We cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees, agents and business partners. Any such violation of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation, our business and results of operations.\nWe Are Subject to Litigation and Environmental Regulations That Could Adversely Impact Our Operating Results\nWe are, and may in the future be, a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims, including those involving intellectual property, product liability (including asbestos) and environmental matters, several of which claim, or may in the future claim, si\ngnificant damages. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we can offer no assurance that\n12\nexisting litigation or a future adverse development will not have a material adverse impact. We also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment, and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws. In addition, increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international, federal, and/or state or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that could result in more restrictive or expansive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions or more prescriptive reporting of environmental, social, and governance metrics. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate change legislation and standards, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. While the Company has adopted certain voluntary targets, environmental laws, regulations or standards may be changed, accelerated or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company, its products or customers, which could negatively impact the Company’s business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position."

    "text": "Safe Harbor Statement\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains various forward-looking statements and includes assumptions concerning Emerson's operations, future results and prospects. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Emerson undertakes no obligation to update any such statements to reflect later developments. In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Emerson provides the cautionary statements set forth under Item 1A - “Risk Factors,” which are hereby incorporated by reference and identify important economic, political and technological factors, among others, changes in which could cause the actual results or events to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the forward-looking statements and related assumptions.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the Company’s financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), management periodically uses certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” as such term is defined in Regulation G under SEC rules, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and\n15\nprospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For exa\nmple, non-GAAP measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions or divestitures, amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs, discrete taxes, ch\nanges in reporting segments, gains, losses and impairments, or items outside of management’s control, such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that the following non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the Company’s financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as identified in italics below. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies.\nUnderlying sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented, are provided to facilitate relevant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability (U.S. GAAP measure:\nnet sales\n).\nOperating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating profit divided by net sales) are indicative of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability. EBIT (defined as earnings before deductions for interest expense, net and income taxes) and total segment EBIT, and EBIT margin (defined as EBIT divided by net sales) and total segment EBIT margin, are financial measures that exclude the impact of financing on the capital structure and income taxes. EBITDA (defined as EBIT excluding depreciation and amortization) and EBITDA margin (defined as EBITDA divided by net sales) are used as measures of the Company's current operating performance, as they exclude the impact of capital and acquisition-related investments. All of these are commonly used financial measures utilized by management to evaluate performance (U.S. GAAP measures:\npretax earnings or pretax profit margin\n).\nEarnings, earnings per share, return on common stockholders’ equity and return on total capital excluding certain gains and losses, impairments, restructuring costs, impacts of acquisitions or divestitures, amortization of intangibles, discrete taxes, or other items provide additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company and facilitate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the earnings impact of these items. Management believes that presenting earnings, earnings per share, return on common stockholders' equity and return on total capital excluding these items is more representative of the Company’s operational performance and may be more useful for investors (U.S. GAAP measures:\nearnings, earnings per share, return on common stockholders’ equity, return on total capital\n).\nFree cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) and free cash flow as a percent of net sales are indicators of the Company’s cash generating capabilities, and dividends as a percent of free cash flow is an indicator of the Company's ability to support its dividend, after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations. The determination of operating cash flow adds back noncash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures. Management believes that free cash flow, free cash flow as a percent of net sales and dividends as a percent of free cash flow are useful to both management and investors as measures of the Company’s ability to generate cash and support its dividend (U.S. GAAP measures:\noperating cash flow, operating cash flow as a percent of net sales, dividends as a percent of operating cash flow\n).\n16\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nReport of Management\nThe Company's management is responsible for the integrity and accuracy of the financial statements. Management believes that the financial statements for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2021 have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles appropriate in the circumstances. In preparing the financial statements, management makes informed judgments and estimates where necessary to reflect the expected effects of events and transactions that have not been completed. The Company's disclosure controls and procedures ensure that material information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and communicated to management and reported within the required time periods.\nIn meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the financial statements, management relies on a system of internal accounting controls. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in accordance with management's authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The design of this system recognizes that errors or irregularities may occur and that estimates and judgments are required to assess the relative cost and expected benefits of the controls. Management believes that the Company's internal accounting controls provide reasonable assurance that errors or irregularities that could be material to the financial statements are prevented or would be detected within a timely period.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors, is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process. The Audit Committee meets with management and the Company's internal auditors periodically to review the work of each and to monitor the discharge by each of its responsibilities. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the independent auditors, who have free access to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors, to discuss the quality and acceptability of the Company's financial reporting and internal controls, as well as nonaudit-related services.\nThe independent auditors are engaged to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Their opinions are based on procedures that they believe to be sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements contain no material errors and that the Company's internal controls are effective.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and the criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2021.\nThe Company's auditor, KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n17\nResults of Operations\nYears ended September 30\n(Dollars in Item 7 are in millions, except per share amounts or where noted)\nOVERVIEW\nOverall, sales for 2021 were $18.2 billion, up 9 percent compared with the prior year, supported by foreign currency translation which added 3 percent and the Open Systems International, Inc. (\"OSI\") acquisition which added 1 percent. Sales recovered to the levels achieved in 2019 prior to the outbreak and spread of COVID-19, reflecting the Company's strong rebound from the broad challenges faced in fiscal 2020. Further, the Company's restructuring and cost reset actions that began in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and which were increased in response to COVID-19 contributed to strong profitability and a significant decrease in SG&A expenses as a percent of sales.\nNet earnings common stockholders were $2,303 in 2021, up 17 percent compared with prior year earnings of $1,965, and diluted earnings per share were $3.82, up 18 percent versus $3.24 per share in 2020, reflecting strong operating results.\nThe Company generated operating cash flow of $3.6 billion in 2021, an increase of $492, or 16 percent, due to higher earnings.\nNET SALES\nNet sales for 2021 were $18.2 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion, or 9 percent compared with 2020. Sales increased $455 in Automation Solutions and $1,010 in Commercial & Residential Solutions. Underlying sales, which exclude foreign currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures, increased 5 percent on higher volume and slightly higher price. The OSI acquisition added\n1 percent\nand foreign currency translation added 3 percent. Underlying sales increased 5 percent in the U.S. and 5 percent internationally.\nNet sales for 2020 were $16.8 billion, a decrease of $1.6 billion, or 9 percent compared with 2019, as the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 resulted in a rapid decline in demand which impacted most of the Company's end markets and geographies in the second half of the year. Sales decreased $1,047 in Automation Solutions and\n18\n$526 in Commercial & Residential Solutions. Underlying sales decreased 8 percent on lower volume, while foreign currency translation subtracted 1 percent. Underlying sales decreased 11 percent in the U.S. and 5 percent internationally.\nINTERNATIONAL\nSALES\nEmerson is a global business with international sales representing 57 percent of total sales\nin 2021, including U.S. exports. The Company generally expects faster economic growth in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Middle East/Africa.\nInternational destination sales, including U.S. exports, increased 10 percent, to $10.3 billion in 2021, reflecting increases in both the Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions businesses. U.S. exports of $1.1 billion were up 12 percent compared with 2020. Underlying international destination sales were up 5 percent, as foreign currency translation had a 4 percent favorable impact on the comparison and the OSI acquisition added 1 percent. Underlying sales increased 5 percent in Europe, 5 percent in Asia, Middle East & Africa (China up 15 percent), 9 percent in Latin America and 1 percent in Canada. Origin sales by international subsidiaries, including shipments to the U.S., totaled $9.3 billion in 2021, up 9 percent compared with 2020.\nInternational destination sales, including U.S. exports, decreas\ned 6 percent, to $9.4 billion in\n2020\n, reflecting decreases in both the Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions businesses. U.S. exports of\n$1.0 billion\nwere down 10 percent compared with 2019. Underlying international destination sales were down 5 percent, as foreign currency translation had a 1 percent unfavorable impact on the comparison. Underlyi\nng sales decreased 4 percent in Europe, 4 percent in Asia, Middle East & Africa (China down 5 percent), 7 percent in Latin America and 11 percent in Canada. Origin sales by international subsidiaries, including shipments to the U.S., totaled\n$8.5 billion in 2020\n, down\n5 percent compared with 2019.\nACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nOn October 11, 2021, the Company announced that it entered into a definitive agreement with Aspen Technology, Inc. (\"AspenTech\") to combine two of Emerson's stand-alone industrial software businesses, Open Systems International, Inc. (\"OSI\") and the geological simulation software business, along with a contribution of $6.0 billion in cash to AspenTech shareholders, to create \"new AspenTech\", a diversified, high-performance industrial software leader with greater scale, capabilities and technologies. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company will own 55 percent of new AspenTech and its results and financial position will be fully consolidated in Emerson's financial statements. On a pro forma basis, new AspenTech is expected to have fiscal 2022 revenues of $1.1 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the second calendar quarter of 2022 and is subject to approval by AspenTech shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. See Item 1A - \"Risk Factors\" for additional information.\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of OSI, a leading operations technology software provider in the global power industry, for approximately $1.6 billion, net of cash acquired. This business had net sales of $191 in fiscal 2021 and is reported in the Automation Solutions segment.\nIn 2020, the Company acquired three businesses, two in the Automation Solutions segment and one in the Climate Technologies segment,\nfor\n$126\n, net of cash acquired. These three businesses had combined annual sales of approximately $50.\nThe Company acquired eight businesses in 2019, all in the Automation Solutions segment, for $469, net of cash acquired. These eight businesses had combined annual sales of approximately $300.\nSee Note 4 for further information on acquisitions and divestitures.\nCOST OF SALES\nCost of sales for 2021 were $10,673, an increase of $897 compared with $9,776 in 2020, primarily due to higher sales volume in Commercial & Residential Solutions, foreign currency translation, and the OSI acquisition which added $112 including intangibles amortization of $39. Gross profit was $7,563 in 2021 compared to $7,009 in 2020, while gross margin decreased 0.3 percentage points to 41.5 percent, as leverage on higher sales volume was offset\n19\nby unfavorable price-cost in Commercial & Residential Solutions primarily driven by higher steel prices, intangibles amortization from the OSI acquisition which deducted 0.2 percentage points, and unfavorable mix.\nCost of sales for 2020 were $9,776, a decrease of $781 compared with $10,557 in 2019, primarily due to lower volume. Gross profit was $7,009 in 2020 compared to $7,815 in 2019, while gross margin decreased 0.7 percentage points to 41.8 percent, reflecting deleverage on lower sales volume and unfavorable mix within Automation Solutions, partially offset by favorable price-cost.\nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\nSG&A expenses of $4,179 in 2021 increased $193 compared with 2020 on higher stock compensation expense, as well as increased sales volume. SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 0.9 percentage points to 22.9 percent, reflecting increased savings of approximately $240 from the Company's restructuring and cost reset actions, partially offset by higher stock compensation expense of $114 (0.6 percentage points) due to a higher share price in the current year.\nSG&A expenses of $3,986 in 2020 decreased $471 compared with 2019 and SG&A as a percent of sales decreased 0.4 percentage points to 23.8 percent. Savings of approximately $220 from the Company's restructuring and cost reset actions that began in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 offset deleverage on lower sales volume.\nThe Company also benefited in the second half of the year from a salary and hiring freeze, furloughs, compensation reductions for the Board of Directors and key executives across Emerson, and curtailed travel, meetings and discretionary spending.\nOTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET\nOther deductions, net were $318 in 2021, a decrease of $214 compared with 2020, reflecting lower restructuring costs of $134, investment-related gains,\nincluding gains in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 of $21 from an investment sale and $17 from the acquisition of full ownership of an equity investment, and a gain in the second quarter of $31 from the sale of an equity investment, a favorable impact from pensions, and favorable foreign currency transactions of $17.\nThese items were partially offset by higher intangibles amortization of $61, primarily related to the OSI acquisition. See Notes 5 and 6.\nOther deductions, net were $532 in 2020, an increase of $207 compared with 2019. The increase reflects increased restructuring costs of $189 and special advisory fees of $13.\nINTEREST EXPENSE, NET\nInterest expense, net was\n$154\n,\n$156\nand\n$174\nin 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decreases in 2021 and 2020 reflect the maturity of long-term debt with relatively higher interest rates, partially offset by lower interest income.\nEARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES\nPretax earnings of $2,912 increased $577 in 2021, up 25 percent compared with 2020. Earnings increased $425 in Automation Solutions and $246 in Commercial & Residential Solutions.\nCosts reported at Corporate increased $96, reflecting higher stock compensation expense of $114 and first year acquisition accounting charges and fees related to the OSI acquisition of $50, partially offset by the investment-related gains discussed above and lower unallocated pension and postretirement costs which decreased by $41. See the Business Segments discussion that follows and Note 18.\nPretax earnings of $2,335 decreased $524 in 2020, down 18 percent compared with 2019. Earnings decreased $424 in Automation Solutions and $153 in Commercial & Residential Solutions. Costs reported at Corporate decreased $35, as an increase in unallocated pension and postretirement costs of $55 was more than offset by a decline in all other corporate costs of $90.\nINCOME TAXES\nIn\ncome taxes were $585, $345 and $531 for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of 20 percent, 15 percent and 19 percent in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The tax rates for 2021, 2020 and 2019 included benefits from restructuring subsidiaries of $13, $103 and $74, respectively. The 2020 rate also included the impact of a research and development tax credit study, while 2019 included a $13 discrete tax benefit due to the issuance of final regulations related to the one-time tax on deemed repatriation. See Note 14.\n20\nNET\nEARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE\nNet earnings attributable to common stockholders in 2021 were $2,303, up 17 percent compared with 2020, and diluted earnings per share were $3.82, up 18 percent compared with $3.24 in 2020 due to improved operating results reflecting significant savings from the Company's restructuring and cost reset actions and leverage on higher sales volume in Commercial & Residential Solutions.\nNet earnings attributable to common stockholders in 2020 were $1,965, down 15 percent compared with 2019, and diluted earnings per share were $3.24, down 13 percent compared with $3.71 in 2019. Reduced operating results reflected a decline in sales volume largely attributable to the negative effects of COVID-19, while restructuring expense increased significantly due to\nthe Company's cost reset actions that began in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.\nThe tables below present the Company's diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis to facilitate period-to-period comparisons and provide additional insight into the underlying, ongoing operating performance of the Company. Certain non-operational items are excluded from the calculation of adjusted earnings per share as noted below. In addition, adjusted earnings per share excludes the impact of restructuring expense due to the Company's significant cost reset actions that began in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.\nThe table below summarizes the changes in adjusted diluted earnings per share. The items identified below are discussed throughout MD&A, see further discussion above and in the Business Segments and Financial Position sections below.\nRETURNS ON EQUITY AND TOTAL CAPITAL\nReturn on common stockholder\ns' equity (net earnings attributable to common stockholders divided by average common stockholders' equity) was 25.2 percent in 2021 compared with 23.6 percent in 2020 and 26.8 percent in 2019. Return on total capital\n(computed as net earnings attributable to common stockholders excluding after-tax net interest expense, divided by average common stockholders' equity plus short- and l\nong-term debt less cash and short-term investments) was 18.1 percent in\n2021 compared with 16.8 percent in 2020 and 19.5 percent in 2019\n. Returns in 2021 reflected higher net earnings, while lower net earnings negatively impacted returns in 2020.\n21\nBusiness Segments\nFollowing is an analysis of segment results for 2021 compared with 2020, and 2020 compared with 2019. In fiscal 2021, the Company reclassified certain software product sales that were previously reported in Measurement and Analytical Instrumentation to Systems & Software (previously described as Process Control Systems & Solutions).\nThe Company defines segment earnings as earnings before interest and income taxes.\n2021 vs. 2020\n- Automation Solutions sales were $11.6 billion in 2021, an increase of $455, or 4 percent. Underlying sales were flat as higher prices offset slightly lower volume. Discrete and hybrid markets exhibited strength throughout the year while longer cycle process automation markets began to recover in the second half of the year, including a sharp recovery in core North American automation markets. The OSI acquisition added 2 percent and foreign currency translation had a 2 percent favorable impact. Sales for Measurement & Analytical Instrumentation decreased $37, or 1 percent,\nas process industries were weak in the first half of the year, but have improved sequentially as markets continue to recover from the impacts of COVID-19.\nValves, Actuators & Regulators decreased $106, or 3 percent, reflecting slower demand in most end markets, particularly in North America and Europe, partially offset by modest growth in Asia. Industrial Solutions sales increased $254, or 13 percent, on strong growth in Europe and robust growth in China, while North American discrete end markets were up moderately. Systems & Software increased $344, or 14 percent, reflecting the impact of the OSI acquisition which added $191. Process end markets were strong in Europe and had moderate growth in Asia while North America was flat. Power generation end markets were solid in North America and strong in Europe, partially offset by softness in Asia. Underlying sales decreased 2 percent in the Americas (U.S. down 3 percent), increased 1 percent in Europe and 2 percent in Asia, Middle East & Africa (China up 14 percent). Earnings of $1,948 increased $425 from the prior year, and m\nargin increased 3.2 percentage points to 16.8 percent,\nas significant savings from cost reduction actions and favorable price-cost more than offset\nhigher performance-based compensation expense. Lower restructuring expense benefited margins 0.9 percentage points, while intangibles amortization of $66 from the OSI acquisition reduced margin 0.6 percentage points.\n2020 vs. 2019\n- Automation Solutions sales were $11.2 billion in 2020, a decrease of $1,047, or 9 percent, reflecting the negative effects of COVID-19 which impacted most end markets and geographies in the second half of the year, particularly in North America. Underlying sales decreased 8 percent on lower volume. The Machine Automation Solutions acquisition added $47 and foreign currency translation had a 1 percent unfavorable impact. Sales for Measurement & Analytical Instrumentation decreased $507, or 14 percent, due to weakness in process industries, primarily in North America. Valves, Actuators & Regulators decreased $205, or 5 percent, reflecting slower demand in most end markets. Industrial Solutions sales decreased $220, or 10 percent, on lower global demand in discrete end markets. Systems & Software decreased $115, or 4 percent, due to weakness in power generation end markets in China and process end markets in the U.S., partially offset by the Machine Automation Solutions acquisition. Underlying sales decreased 14 percent in the Americas (U.S. down 14 percent), 5 percent in Europe, and 1 percent in Asia, Middle East & Africa (China down 2 percent). Earnings of $1,523 decreased $424 from the prior year, primarily due to higher restructuring expenses of $179 and lower volume. Margin decreased 2.4 percentage points\n22\nto 13.6 percent, reflecting a negative impact from restructuring expenses of 1.7 percentage points and unfavorable mix. Savings from cost reduction actions offset deleverage on lower sales volume.\n2021 vs. 2020\n- Commercial & Residential Solutions sales were $6.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $1,010, or 18 percent. Underlying sales increased 16 percent on strong global demand, as nearly all businesses achieved double-digit growth each quarter, while foreign currency translation added 2 percent. Climate Technologies sales were $4.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $768, or 19 percent.\nAir conditioning an\nd heating sales were up mid-teens, reflecting strong demand for residential-oriented products and solutions in North America and robust growth in Europe and China. Cold chain sales were up over 20 percent, driven by favorable global market conditions and strength in food retail and aftermarket. Tools & Home Products sales were $1.9 billion in 2021, up $242 or 15 percent compared to the prior year. Sales of wet/dry vacuums\nwere robust in part due to competitor outages, while sales were strong for\nglobal professional tools and solid for\nfood waste disposers\n. Overall, underlying sales increased 16 percent in the Americas (U.S. up 15 percent) and 17 percent in Europe, while Asia, Middle East & Africa increased 17 percent (China up 17 percent). Earnings were $1,364, an increase of $246, and margin was up 0.7 percentage points, reflecting leverage on higher volume and savings from cost reduction actions, partially offset by unfavorable price-cost primarily due to steel price increases which negatively impacted the second half of the fiscal year.\n2020 vs. 2019\n- Commercial & Residential Solutions sales were $5.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of $526, or 9 percent. Underlying sales decreased 7 percent on lower volume. The divestiture of two small non-core businesses subtracted 1 percent and foreign currency translation deducted 1 percent. Climate Technologies sales were $4.0 billion in 2020, a decrease of $333, or 8 percent. Air conditioning and heating sales declined, reflecting a sharp decline in Asia and moderate decline in the U.S. due to the effects of COVID-19. Global cold chain sales were also down, reflecting double-digit declines in Asia and Europe, while North America was down moderately. Tools & Home Products sales were $1.7 billion in 2020, down $193 or 10 percent compared to the prior year, reflecting sharp declines in global professional tools markets. Sales for wet/dry vacuums were down moderately and food waste disposers were down slightly. Overall, underlying sales decreased 7 percent in the Americas (U.S. down 8 percent) and 3 percent in Europe, while Asia, Middle East & Africa decreased 11 percent (China down 11 percent). Earnings were $1,118, a decrease of $153, and margin was down 0.8 percentage points, due to deleverage on lower sales volume and higher restructuring expenses which negatively impacted margins by 0.5 percentage points, partially offset by savings from cost reduction actions and favorable price-cost.\nFinancial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nEmerson maintains a conservative financial structure to provide the strength and flexibility necessary to achieve our strategic objectives and has been successful in efficiently deploying cash where needed worldwide to fund operations, complete acquisitions and sustain long-term growth.\nEmerson is in a strong financial position, with total assets of $25 billion and stockholders' equity of $10 billion, and has the resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short- and long-term basis.\n23\nThe Company continues to generate substantial operating cash flow, including significant growth in fiscal 2021 and over $3.0 billion in each of the last three years. Cash flows have been and are expected to be sufficient for at least the next 12 months to meet the Company’s operating requirements, including those related to salaries and wages, working capital, capital expenditures, and other liquidity requirements associated with operations. The Company also has certain contractual obligations, primarily long-term debt and operating leases (see Notes 7, 10 and 11). The Company currently believes that sufficient funds will be available to meet its needs for the foreseeable future through operating cash flow, existing resources, short- and long-term debt capacity, or its $3.5 billion revolving backup credit facility under which it has not incurred any borrowings.\nOperating cash flow for 2021 was $3.6 billion, a $492, or 16 percent increase compared with 2020, due to higher earnings. Operating cash flow of $3.1 billion in 2020 increased 3 percent compared to $3.0 billion in 2019, as lower working ca\npital needs associated with lower demand more than offset a decrease in earnings.  At September 30, 2021, operating working capital as a percent of sales was\n3.9 percent\ncompared with 5.2 percent in 2020 and 6.1 percent in 2019. Contributions to pension plans were $41 in 2021, $66 in 2020 and $60 in 2019.\nCapital expenditures were $581, $538 and $594 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital expenditures) was $3.0 billion in 2021, up 18 percent. Free cash flow was $2.5 billion in 2020, compared with $2.4 billion in 2019. The\nCompany is targeting capital spending of approximately $650 in 2022. Net cash paid in connection with acquisitions was $1,611, $126 and $469 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and among other things, provided tax relief to businesses. Tax provisions of the CARES Act included the deferral of certain payroll taxes, relief for retaining employees, and other provisions. The Company deferred $73 of certain payroll taxes through the end of calendar year\n2020, half of which is due in December 2021 with the remainder due in December 2022.\nDividends were $1,210 ($2.02 per share) in 2021, compared with $1,209 ($2.00 per share) in 2020 and $1,209 ($1.96 per share) in 2019. In November 2021, the Board of Directors voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend 2 percent, to an annualized rate of $2.06 per share.\nPurchases of Emerson common stock totaled $500, $942 and $1,250 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, at average per share prices of $94.65, $57.41 and $62.83.\nThe Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 70 million common shares in November 2015. In March 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional 60 million shares and a total of approximately 60 million shares remain available for purchase under the authorizations. The Company purchase\nd 5.3 mi\nllion shares in 2021, 16.4 million shares in 2020 and 19.9 million shares in 2019 under the authorizations.\n24\nTotal debt, which includes long-term debt, current maturities of long-term debt, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, was $6,665, $7,486 an\nd $5,721 as of September 30,\n2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDuring the year, the Company repaid $300 of 4.25% notes tha\nt matured in November 2020\n.\nIn 2020, the Company repaid $500 of 4.875% notes that matured in October 2019, while $400 of 5.25% notes that matured in October 2018 and $250 of 5.0% notes that matured in April 2019 were paid in fiscal 2019. In April 2020, the Company issued $500 of 1.8% notes due October 2027, $500 of 1.95% notes due October 2030 and $500 of 2.75% notes due October 2050, and in September 2020, the Company issued $750 of 0.875% notes due October 2026. In January 2019, the Company issued €500 of 1.25% notes due October 2025 and €500 of 2.0% notes due October 2029, and in May 2019, the Company issued €500 of 0.375% notes due May 2024. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to reduce commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. A portion of the proceeds from the notes issued in September 2020 were also used to fund the acquisition of OSI, which closed on October 1, 2020.\nThe total debt-to-total capi\ntal ratio\nand net debt-to-net capital ratio (less cash and short-term investments) decreased in 2021 due to lower long-term debt and higher equity compared to the prior year. In 2020 the total debt-to-total capital ratio increased due to the long-term debt issuances described above. The net debt-to-net capital ratio decreased slightly, reflecting the timing of the acquisition of OSI, which closed shortly after fiscal 2020 year-end. The operating cash flow-to-debt ratio increased in 2021 due to higher cash flow and lower debt. The decrease in 2020 was due to the increased borrowings. The interest coverage ratio is computed as earnings before income taxes plus interest expense, divided by interest expense. The increase in 2021 reflects higher earnings and slightly lower interest expense. The decrea\nse in 2020 reflects lower earnings, partially offset by lower interest expense.\nIn May 2018, the Company entered into a $3.5 billion five-year revolving backup credit facility with various banks, which replaced the April 2014 $3.5 billion facility. The credit facility is maintained to support general corporate purposes, including commercial paper borrowings. The Company has not incurred any borrowings under this or previous facilities. The credit facility contains no financial covenants and is not subject to termination based on a change of credit rating or material adverse changes. The facility is unsecured and may be accessed under various interest rate alternatives at the Company’s option. Fees to maintain the facility are immaterial. The Company also maintains a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which it can issue debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, share purchase contracts or share purchase units without a predetermined limit. Securities can be sold in one or more separate offerings with the size, price and terms to be determined at the time of sale.\nEmerson's financial structure provides the flexibility necessary to achieve its strategic objectives. The Company has been successful in efficiently deploying cash where needed worldwide to fund operations, complete acquisitions and sustain long-term growth. At September 30, 2021,\nsubstantially all of the Company's cash was held outside of the U.S. (primarily in Europe and Asia). The Company routinely repatriates a portion of its no\nn-U.S. cash from earnings each year, or otherwise when it can be accomplished tax efficiently, and provides for withholding taxes and any applicable U.S. income taxes as appropriate. The Company has been able to readily meet all its funding requirements and currently believes that sufficient funds will be available to meet the Company's needs in the foreseeable future through operating cash flow, existing resources, short- and long-term debt capacity or backup credit lines.\n25\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, and selectively uses derivative financial instruments, including forwards, swaps and purchased options to manage these risks. The Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The value of derivatives and other financial instruments is subject to change as a result of market movements in rates and prices. Sensitivity analysis is one technique used to forecast the impact of these movements. Based on a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates, a 10 percent decrease in commodity prices or a 10 percent weakening in the U.S. dollar across all currencies, the potential losses in future earnings, fair value or cash flows are not material. Sensitivity analysis has limitations; for example, a weaker U.S. dollar would benefit future earnings through favorable translation of non-U.S. operating results, and lower commodity prices would benefit future earnings through lower cost of sales. See Notes 1, and 9 through 11.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nPreparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates regarding uncertainties that could affect reported revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. Note 1 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The most significant areas where management judgments and estimates impact the primary financial statements are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ materially from management's estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe Company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services and recognizes revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied and control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment. The vast majority of the Company's revenues relate to a broad offering of manufactured products which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers, generally in accordance with shipping terms. A portion of the Company's revenues relate to the sale of software and post-contract customer support, parts and labor for repairs, and engineering services.\nIn limited circumstances, contracts include multiple performance obligations, where revenue is recognized separately for each good or service, as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers to the customer. Tangible products represent a large majority of the delivered items in contracts with multiple performance obligations or where revenue is recognized over time, while a smaller portion is attributable to installation, service and maintenance. In sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Observable selling prices from actual transactions are used whenever possible. In other instances, the Company determines the standalone selling price based on third-party pricing or management's best estimate. For revenues recognized over time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue, based on costs incurred. The Company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer.\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS\nLong-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate impairment may exist. If the Company determines that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable, a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its estimated fair value. Reporting units are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist, it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value. Fair value is generally estimated using an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using discount rates judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk. Estimates of future sales, operating results, cash flows and discount rates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including such factors as the general level of market interest rates, expected equity market returns and the volatility of markets served, particularly when recessionary economic circumstances continue for an extended period of time.\n26\nRETIREMENT PLANS\nThe Company maintains a prudent long-term investment strategy consistent with the duration of pension obligations. The determination of defined benefit plan expense and liabilities is dependent on various assumptions, including the expected annual rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate and the rate of annual compensation increases. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, actual results that differ from the Compa\nny's assumptions are accumulated as deferred actuarial gains or losses and amortized to expense in future periods. The Company's principal U.S. defined benefit plan is closed to employees hired after January 1, 2016 while shorter-tenured employees ceased accruing benefits effective October 1, 2016.\nAs of September 30, 2021, the U.S. pension plans were overfunded by $506 in total (approximately 12 percent in excess of the projected benefit obligation), including unfunded plans totaling $220. The substantial improvement in the funded status reflects strong asset returns in fiscal 2021. The non-U.S. plans were underfunded by $88, including unfunded plans totaling $318. The Company contributed a total of $41 to defined benefit plans in 2021 and expects to contribute approximately $50 in 2022. At year-end 2021, the discount rate for U.S. plans was 2.92 percent, and was 2.81 percent in 2020. The assumed investment return on plan assets was 6.50 percent in 2021, 6.75 percent in 2020 and 7.00 percent in 2019, and will be 6.00 percent for 2022. While management believes its assumptions used are appropriate, actual experience may differ. A 0.25 percentage point decrease in the U.S. and non-U.S. discount rates would have increased the total projected benefit obligation at September 30, 2021 by $200 and increased fiscal 2022 pension expense by $15. A 0.25 percentage point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase fiscal 2022 pension expense by $15. See Note 12.\nCONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nThe Company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims, including those involving general and product liability (including asbestos)\nand other matters, several of which claim substantial amounts of damages. The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs (including legal fees and expenses) will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based on developments to date; management's estimates of the outcomes of these matters; and the Company's experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. The Company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve all pending and future asbestos claims, including defense costs, as well as its related insurance receivables. The reserve for asbestos litigation, which is recorded on an undiscounted basis, is based on projected claims through 2065.\nAlthough it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company historically has been largely successful in defending itself against claims and suits that have been brought against it, and will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. While the Company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the Company. See Note 13.\nINCOME TAXES\nIncome tax expense and tax assets and liabilities reflect management's assessment of taxes paid or expected to be paid (received) on items included in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and consideration of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income taxes are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. This requires management to make judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income, and the impact of tax planning strategies.\nUncertainty exists regarding tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns which remain subject to examination, along with positions expected to be taken in future returns. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits, based on the technical merits, when it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Adjustments are made to the uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit; changes in applicable tax laws, including tax case rulings and legislative guidance; or expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.\nCash repatriated to the U.S. is generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes. No provision is made for withholding taxes and any applicable U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries\n27\nwhere these earnings are considered indefinitely invested or otherwise retained for continuing international operations. Determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable. See Notes 1 and 14.\nOther Items\nLEGAL MATTERS\nAt September 30, 2021, there were no known contingent liabilities (including guarantees, pending litigation, taxes and other claims) that management believes will be material in relation to the Company's financial statements, nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nEffective October 1, 2020, the Company adopted two accounting standard updates and one new accounting standard, and in fiscal 2020 adopted updates to ASC 815, all of which had an immaterial impact on the Company's financial statements. These included:\n•\nUpdates to ASC 350,\nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\n, which eliminate the requirement to measure impairment based on the implied fair value of goodwill compared to the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill. Instead, goodwill impairment will be measured as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.\n•\nUpdates to ASC 350,\nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\n, which align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a software hosting arrangement with the requirements for costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software.\n•\nAdoption of ASC 326,\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\n, which amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach to estimate lifetime expected credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables.\n•\nUpdates to ASC\n815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n, which permit hedging certain contractually specified risk components. The updates also eliminate the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and simplify hedge documentation and effectiveness assessment requirements.\nOn October 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC 842,\nLeases,\nwhich requires rights and obligations related to lease arrangements to be recognized on the balance sheet, using the optional transition method under which prior periods were not adjusted. The Company elected the package of practical expedients for leases that commenced prior to the adoption date, which included carrying forward the historical lease classification as operating or finance. The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities of approximately $500 as of October 1, 2019, but did not materially impact the Company's earnings or cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2020. The Company's financial statements for 2019 continue to be reported in accordance with the Company's historical accounting under ASC 840,\nLeases\n.\nOn October 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n, which updated and consolidated revenue recognition guidance from multiple sources into a single, comprehensive standard to be applied for all contracts with customers. The fundamental principle of the revised standard is to recognize revenue based on the transfer of goods and services to customers at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services. The Company adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective approach and applied the guidance to open contracts which were not completed at the date of adoption. The cumulative effect of adoption resulted in a $30 increase to beginning retained earnings as of October 1, 2018. This increase primarily related to contracts where a portion of revenue for delivered goods or services was previously deferred due to contingent payment terms. The adoption of ASC 606 did not materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2019.\nFISCAL 2022 OUTLOOK\nEmerson expects fiscal 2022 to be characterized by strong underlying demand. Strength in discrete and hybrid automation markets, further recovery in process markets and expanding opportunities in sustainability projects is expected to drive Automation Solutions full year net sales growth. For Commercial & Residential Solutions, residential demand is expected to moderate while the commercial and industrial environment is expected to further\n28\nimprove. The Company expects operational challenges to continue through the first half of the year, but price-cost is expected to turn to a tailwind during the second half.\nFor the full year, consolidated net sales are expected to be up 5 to 7 percent, with underlying sales up 6 to 8 percent excluding a 1 percent unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Automation Solutions net sales are expected to be up 5 to 7 percent, with underlying sales up 6 to 8 percent excluding a 1 percent unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation. Commercial & Residential Solutions net and underlying sales are expected to be up 6 to 9\npercent. Earnings per share are expected to be $4.79 to $4.94, while adjusted earnings per share, which exclude a $0.19 per share impact from restructuring actions, a $0.42 per share impact from amortization of intangibles, and a $0.58 gain from proceeds received in November 2021 related to the Vertiv transaction, are expected to be $4.82 to $4.97 (see Note 4 for further details on the Vertiv gain). Operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $3.8 billion and free cash flow, which excludes projected capital spending of $650 million, is expected to be approximately $3.1 billion. Share repurchases are expected to be approximately $250 to $500 million in fiscal 2022.\nThe guidance discussed herein does not include the impact of the AspenTech transaction. Emerson will contribute $6.0 billion in cash related to its definitive agreement with AspenTech, and the transaction is expected to close in the second calendar quarter of 2022. The Company expects to finance the transaction through a combination of cash on-hand and the issuance of new long-term debt. While the transaction will initially increase the Company's financial leverage and debt ratios, Emerson expects to retain its investment-grade long-term debt ratings. Further, the Company expects its leverage and debt ratios to improve rapidly through strong combined cash flow of the companies and disciplined capital allocation.\nBrexit Update\nThe United Kingdom's (UK) withdrawal from the European Union (EU), commonly known as \"Brexit\", was completed on January 31, 2020. Negotiations over the terms of trade and other laws and regulations took place during 2020 and an agreement between the EU and the UK was reached on December 24, 2020, which included zero tariffs and quotas on goods. The Company's net sales in the UK are principally in the Automation Solutions segment and represent less than two percent of consolidated sales. While there could be certain incremental costs for logistics and other items, the Company expects any impact of these items will be immaterial."

Actual results could differ from these estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to\nconform with current year presentation.\nEffective October 1, 2020, the Company adopted two accounting standard updates and one new accounting standard, and in fiscal 2020 adopted updates to ASC 815, all of which had an immaterial impact on the Company's financial statements. These included:\n•\nUpdates to ASC 350,\nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\n, which eliminate the requirement to measure impairment based on the implied fair value of goodwill compared to the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s goodwill. Instead, goodwill impairment will be measured as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.\n•\nUpdates to ASC 350,\nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\n, which align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a software hosting arrangement with the requirements for costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software.\n•\nAdoption of ASC 326,\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\n, which amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach to estimate lifetime expected credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables.\n•\nUpdates to ASC\n815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n, which permit hedging certain contractually specified risk components. The updates also eliminate the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and simplify hedge documentation and effectiveness assessment requirements.\nOn October 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC 842,\nLeases,\nwhich requires rights and obligations related to lease arrangements to be recognized on the balance sheet, using the optional transition method under which prior periods were not adjusted. The Company elected the package of practical expedients for leases that commenced prior to the adoption date, which included carrying forward the historical lease classification as operating or finance. The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities of approximately $\n500\nas of October 1, 2019, but did not materially impact the Company's earnings or cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2020. The Company's financial statements for 2019 continue to be reported in accordance with the Company's historical accounting under ASC 840,\nLeases\n.\nOn October 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n, which updated and consolidated revenue recognition guidance from multiple sources into a single, comprehensive standard to be applied for all contracts with customers. The fundamental principle of the revised standard is to recognize revenue based on the transfer of goods and services to customers at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services. The Company adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective approach and applied the guidance to open contracts which were not completed at the date of adoption. The cumulative effect of adoption resulted in a $\n30\nincrease to beginning retained earnings as of October 1, 2018. This increase primarily related to contracts where a portion of revenue for delivered goods or services was previously deferred due to contingent payment terms. The adoption of ASC 606 did not materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2019.\n35\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its controlled affiliates. Intercompany transactions, profits and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments of 20 percent to 50 percent of the voting shares of other entities are accounted for by the equity method. Investments in publicly traded companies of less than 20 percent are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. Investments in nonpublicly traded companies of less than 20 percent are carried at cost, minus impairment, and adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency for most of the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries is the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The majority of inventory is valued based on standard costs, which approximate average costs, while the remainder is principally valued on a first-in, first-out basis. Cost standards are revised at the beginning of each year. The annual effect of resetting standards plus any operating variances incurred during each period are allocated to inventories and recognized in cost of sales as product is sold. Following are the components of inventory as of September 30:\nFair Value Measurement\nASC 820,\nFair Value Measurement\n, establishes a formal hierarchy and framework for measuring certain financial statement items at fair value, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements and the reliability of valuation inputs. Under ASC 820, measurement assumes the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal or at least the most advantageous market for that asset or liability. Within the hierarchy, Level 1 instruments use observable market prices for an identical item in active markets and have the most reliable valuations. Level 2 instruments are valued through broker/dealer quotation or other approaches using market-observable inputs for similar items in active markets, including forward and spot prices, interest rates and volatilities. Level 3 instruments are valued using inputs not observable in an active market, such as company-developed future cash flow estimates, and are considered the least reliable. Valuations for all of the Company's financial instruments fall within Level 2. The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is Level 2, estimated using current interest rates and pricing from financial institutions and other market sources for debt with similar maturities and characteristics.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nThe Company records investments in land, buildings, and machinery and equipment at cost. Depreciation is computed principally using the straight-line method over estimated service lives, which for principal assets are\n30\nto\n40\nyears for buildings and\n8\nto\n12\nyears for machinery and equipment. Long-lived tangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized based on estimated fair values if the sum of estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the related assets is less than the carrying values.\n36\nThe components of property, plant and equipment as of September 30 follow:\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nAssets and liabilities acquired in business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and recorded at their respective fair values. Substantially all goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that acquires a business. A reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in ASC 280,\nSegment Reporting\n, or a business one level below an operating segment if discrete financial information for that business unit is prepared and regularly reviewed by the segment manager. The Company conducts annual impairment tests of goodwill in the fourth quarter. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not goodwill might be impaired, it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value. An impairment charge would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value. Goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate the fair value of a unit may be less than its carrying value. Estimated fair values of reporting units are Level 3 measures and are developed generally under an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using risk-adjusted interest rates, as well as earnings multiples or other techniques as warranted. Fair values are subject to changes in underlying economic conditions.\nAll of the Company's identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Identifiable intangibles consist of intellectual property such as patents and trademarks, customer relationships and capitalized software. Identifiable intangibles are also subject to evaluation for potential impairment if events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. See Note 8.\nLeases\nThe Company leases offices; manufacturing facilities and equipment; and transportation, information technology and office equipment under operating lease arrangements. Finance lease arrangements are immaterial. The Company determines whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease at contract inception. An arrangement contains a lease if the Company has the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of an identified asset. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet and are recorded as short-term lease expense. The discount rate used to calculate present value is the Company's incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region.\nCertain leases contain renewal options or options to terminate prior to lease expiration, which are included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. The Company has elected to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for its offices and manufacturing facilities. Some lease arrangements include payments that are adjusted periodically based on actual charges incurred for common area maintenance, utilities, taxes and insurance, or changes in an index or rate referenced in the lease. The fixed portion of these payments is included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement, while the variable portion is recorded as variable lease expense. The Company's leases typically do not contain material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\nProduct Warranty\nWarranties vary by product line and are competitive for the markets in which the Company operates. Warranties are largely offered to provide assurance that the product will function as intended and generally extend for a period of\none\nto\ntwo years\nfrom the date of sale or installation. Provisions for warranty expense are estimated at the time of sale based on historical experience and adjusted quarterly for any known issues that may arise. Product warranty expense is less than one-half of\none\npercent of sales.\n37\nRevenue Recognition\nEmerson is a global manufacturer that designs and manufactures products and delivers services that bring technology and engineering together to provide innovative solutions for its customers, largely in the form of tangible products. The Company evaluates its contracts with customers to identify the promised goods or services and recognizes revenue for the identified performance obligations at the amount the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied and control has transferred to the customer, typically when products are shipped or delivered, title and risk of loss pass to the customer, and the Company has a present right to payment. The vast majority of the Company's revenues relate to a broad offering of manufactured products which are recognized at the point in time when control transfers, generally in accordance with shipping terms. A portion of the Company's revenues relate to the sale of software and post-contract customer support, parts and labor for repairs, and engineering services. In limited circumstances, contracts include multiple performance obligations, where revenue is recognized separately for each good or service, as well as contracts where revenue is recognized over time as control transfers to the customer.\nRevenue is recognized over time for approximately\n5\npercent of the Company's revenues. These contracts largely relate to projects in the Systems & Software product offering within the Automation Solutions segment where revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method to reflect the transfer of control over time, while a small amount is attributable to long-term maintenance and service contracts where revenue is typically recognized on a straight-line basis as the services are provided. Approximately\n5\npercent of revenues relate to sales arrangements with multiple performance obligations, principally in the Automation Solutions segment. Tangible products represent a large majority of the delivered items in contracts with multiple performance obligations or where revenue is recognized over time, while a smaller portion is attributable to installation, service and maintenance.\nFor revenues recognized over time, the Company typically uses an input method to determine progress and recognize revenue, based on costs incurred. The Company believes costs incurred closely correspond with its performance under the contract and the transfer of control to the customer.\nIn sales arrangements that involve multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Observable selling prices from actual transactions are used whenever possible. In other instances, the Company determines the standalone selling price based on third-party pricing or management's best estimate. Generally, contract duration is short-term, and cancellation, termination or refund provisions apply only in the event of contract breach and are rarely invoked.\nPayment terms vary but are generally short-term in nature. The Company's long-term contracts, where revenue is generally recognized over time, are typically billed as work progresses in accordance with the contract terms and conditions, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of certain milestones. The timing of revenue recognition and billings under these contracts results in either unbilled receivables (contract assets) when revenue recognized exceeds billings, or customer advances (contract liabilities) when billings exceed revenue recognized. Unbilled receivables are reclassified to accounts receivable when an unconditional right to consideration exists, typically when a milestone in the contract is achieved. The Company does not evaluate whether the transaction price includes a significant financing component for contracts where the time between cash collection and performance is less than one year.\nCertain arrangements with customers include variable consideration, typically in the form of rebates, cash discounts or penalties. In limited circumstances, the Company sells products with a general right of return. In most instances, returns are limited to product quality issues. The Company records a reduction to revenue at the time of sale to reflect the ultimate amount of consideration it expects to receive. The Company's estimates are updated quarterly based on historical experience, trend analysis, and expected market conditions. Variable consideration is typically not constrained at the time revenue is recognized. See Notes 2 and 18 for additional information about the Company's revenues.\nDerivatives and Hedging\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices due to its worldwide presence\nand diverse business pr\nofile. The Company's foreign currency exposures relate to transactions denominated in currencies that differ from the functional currencies of its business units, primarily in euros, Mexican pesos, and Singapore dollars.\nPrimary commodity exposures are price fluctuations on forecasted purchases of copper and aluminum and related\nproducts. As part of the Company's risk\n38\nmanagement strategy, derivative instruments are selectively used in an effort to minimize the impact of these exposures. Foreign exchange forwards and options are utilized to hedge foreign currency exposures impacting sales or cost of sales transactions, firm commitments and the fair value of assets and liabilities, while swap and option contracts may be used to minimize the effect of commodity price fluctuations on the cost of sales. Non-U.S. dollar obligations are utilized to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the Company's net investments in foreign operations. All derivatives are associated with specific underlying exposures and the Company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. The duration of hedge positions is generally\ntwo years\nor less, except for the Company's net investment hedges.\nAll derivatives are accounted for under ASC 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n, and recognized at fair value. For derivatives hedging variability in future cash flows, any gain or loss is deferred in stockholders' equity and recognized when the underlying hedged transaction impacts earnings. The majority of the Company's derivatives that are designated as hedges and qualify for hedge accounting are cash flow hedges. For derivatives hedging the fair value of existing assets or liabilities, both the gain or loss on the derivative and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized in earnings each period. Currency fluctuations on non-U.S. dollar obligations that have been designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to income in the same period when a foreign operation is sold or substantially liquidated and the gain or loss related to the sale is included in income. To the extent that any hedge is not fully effective at offsetting changes in the underlying hedged item, there could be a net earnings impact. The Company also uses derivatives to hedge economic exposures that do not receive hedge accounting under ASC 815. The underlying exposures for these hedges relate primarily to purchases of commodity-based components used in the Company's manufacturing processes, and the revaluation of certain foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities. Gains or losses on derivative instruments not designated as hedges are recognized in the income statement immediately.\nCounterparties to derivative arrangements are companies with investment-grade credit ratings. The Company has bilateral collateral arrangements with counterparties with credit rating-based posting thresholds that vary depending on the arrangement. If credit ratings on the Company's debt fall below pre-established levels, counterparties can require immediate full collateralization on all derivatives in net liability positions. The maximum amount that could potentially have been required was immaterial. The Company also can demand full collateralization of derivatives in net asset positions should any counterparty credit ratings fall below certain thresholds.\nNo\ncollateral was posted with counterparties and\nnone\nwas held by the Company at year end. Risk from credit loss when derivatives are in asset positions is not considered material. The Company has master netting arrangements in place with its counterparties that allow the offsetting of certain derivative-related amounts receivable and payable when settlement occurs in the same period. Accordingly, counterparty balances are netted in the consolidated balance sheet and are reported in other current assets or accrued expenses as appropriate, depending on positions with counterparties as of the balance sheet date. See Note 9.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is based on pretax income reported in the consolidated statements of earnings and tax rates currently enacted in each jurisdiction. Certain income and expense items are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting and income tax filing purposes, and deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences. Effective in fiscal 2019, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act subjects the Company to U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company has elected to recognize this tax as a period expense when it is incurred. The Company also provides for withholding taxes and any applicable U.S. income taxes on earnings intended to be repatriated from non-U.S. locations. No provision has been made for these taxes on approxim\nately $\n5.5\nbillion o\nf undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of September 30, 2021, as these earnings are considered indefinitely invested or otherwise retained for continuing international operations. Recognition of withholding taxes and any applicable U.S. income taxes on undistributed non-U.S. earnings would be triggered by a management decision to repatriate those earnings. Determination of the amount of taxes that might be paid on these undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable. See Note 14.\n39\n(2)\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe following table summarizes the balances of the Company's unbilled receivables (contract assets), which are reported in Other current assets, and its customer advances (contract liabilities), which are reported in Accrued expenses.\nThe majority of the Company's contract balances relate to arrangements where revenue is recognized over time and payments from customers are made according to a contractual billing schedule. The increase in net contract liabilities was due to customer billings which exceeded revenue recognized for performance completed during the period. Revenue recognized for 2021 included approximately $\n460\nthat was included in the beginning contract liability balanc\ne. Other factors that impacted the change in net contract liabilities were immaterial.\nRevenue recognized for 2021 for performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods, including cumulative catchup adjustments on the Company's long-term contracts, was not material. Capitalized amounts related to incremental costs to obtain customer contracts and costs to fulfill contracts are immaterial.\nAs of September 30, 2021, the Company's backlog relating to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations in contracts with its customers was approximately $\n6.5\nbillion. The Company expects to recognize approximately\n85\npercent of its remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next\n12\nmonths, with the remainder substantially over the subsequent two years thereafter.\nSee Note 18 for additional information about the Company's revenues.\n(3)\nWEIGHTED-AVERAGE COMMON SHARES\nBasic earnings per common share consider only the weighted-average of common shares outstanding while diluted earnings per common share also consider the dilutive effects of stock options and incentive shares. An inconsequential number of shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of dilutive earnings per share in 2021, 2020 and 2019 as the effect would have been antidilutive. Earnings allocated to participating securities were inconsequential for all years presented.\nReconciliations of weighted-average shares for basic and diluted earnings per common share follow (shares in millions):\n(4)\nACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nOn October 11, 2021, the Company announced that it entered into a definitive agreement with Aspen Technology, Inc. (\"AspenTech\") to combine two of Emerson's stand-alone industrial software businesses, Open Systems International, Inc. (\"OSI\") and the geological simulation software business, along with a contribution of $\n6.0\nbillion in cash to AspenTech shareholders, to create \"new AspenTech\", a diversified, high-performance industrial software leader with greater scale, capabilities and technologies. Upon closing of the transaction, the Company will own\n55\npercent of new AspenTech and its results and financial position will be fully consolidated in Emerson's financial statements.\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Open Systems International, Inc. (OSI), a leading operations technology software provider in the global power industry, for approximately $\n1.6\nbillion, net of cash acquired. This business, which had net sales of $\n191\nin fiscal 2021 and is reported in the Automation Solutions segme\nnt, expands the Company's offerings in the power industry to include the digitization and modernization of the\n40\nelectric grid\n.\nThe Company recognized goodwill of $\n967\n(\nnone\nof which is expected to be tax deductible), identifiable intangible assets of $\n783\n, primarily intellectual property and customer relationships with a weighted-average useful life of approximately\n11\nyears, and deferred tax liabilities of $\n193\n. Results of operations for the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2021\nincluded first year pretax acquisition accounting charges related to backlog amortization and deferred revenue of $\n30\nand $\n14\n, respectively, and fees of $\n6\n.\nIn 2020, the Company acquired\nthree\nbusinesses,\ntwo\nin the Automation Solutions segment and\none\nin the Climate Technologies segment, for $\n126\n, net of cash acquired. These three businesses had combined annual sales of approximately $\n50\n.\nThe Company acquired\neight\nbusinesses in 2019, all in the Automation Solutions segment, for $\n469\n, net of cash acquired. These\neight\nbusinesses had combined annual sales of approximately $\n300\n. The Company recognized goodwill of $\n209\n($\n155\nof which is expected to be tax deductible) and other identifiable intangible assets of $\n158\n, primarily customer relationships and intellectual property with a weighted-average useful life of approximately\nnine years\n.\nAs previously disclosed, the Company sold its network power systems business (rebranded as Vertiv, now a publicly traded company, symbol VRT) in 2017 and retained a subordinated interest contingent upon the equity holders first receiving a threshold return on their initial investment. Subsequent to September 30, 2021, the equity holders received a return on their investment in excess of the threshold. Based on the terms of the agreement and the current calculation, the Company could receive approximately $\n600\non a pretax basis through periodic distributions over the next two years, of which $\n438\nwas received in November 2021. However, the remaining distributions are contingent on the timing and price at which Vertiv shares are sold by the equity holders and therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of the remaining distributions to the Company. As of September 30, 2021, no amounts have been recognized in the financial statements related to this gain contingency.\n(5)\nOTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET\nThe increase in in\ntangibles amortization expense for 2021 was due to the OSI acquisition, including backlog amortization of $\n30\n. Other is composed of several items, including acquisition/divestiture costs, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, litigation, pension expense and other items.\nThe change in 2021 was primarily due to a favorable impact from pensions and investment-related gains, including gains in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 of $\n21\nfrom an investment sale and $\n17\nfrom the acquisition of full ownership of an equity investment, and a gain in the second quarter of $\n31\nfrom the sale of an equity investment. The change in 2020 was primarily due to special advisory fees of $\n13\n.\n(6)\nRESTRUCTURING COSTS\nEach year the Company incurs costs to size its businesses to levels appropriate for current economic conditions and to continually improve its cost structure and operational efficiency, deploy assets globally, and remain competitive on a worldwide basis. Costs result from numerous individual actions implemented across the Company's various operating units on an ongoing basis and can include costs for moving facilities to best-cost locations, restarting plants after relocation or geographic expansion to better serve local markets, reducing forcecount or the number of facilities, exiting certain product lines, and other costs resulting from asset deployment decisions (such as contract termination costs, asset write-downs and vacant facility costs).\nRestructuring expenses were $\n150\n, $\n284\nand $\n95\nfor 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company expects fiscal year 2022 restructuring expense to be approximately $\n150\n.\n41\nRestructuring costs by business segment follows:\nCosts incurred in 2021 relate to the Company's initiatives to improve operating margins that began in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and were expanded in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 in response to the effects of COVID-19 on demand for the Company's products. A\nctions taken in 2021 inc\nluded workforce reductions of approximately\n3,600\np\nositions and the exit of\neight\nproduction facilities worldwide. Costs incurred in 2020 and 2019 primarily relate to the Company's initiatives to improve operating margins that began in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and were expanded in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 in response to the effects of COVID-19 on demand for the Company's products. Expenses incurred in 2020 and 2019 included actions to exit\nsix\nand\ntwo\nfacilities, and eliminate approximately\n5,400\nand\n1,100\npositions, respectively.\nThe change in the liability for restructuring costs during the years ended September 30 follows:\nThe tables above do not include $\n38\nand $\n20\nof costs related to restructuring actions incurred for the year ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, that are required to be reported in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses.\n(7)\nLEASES\nThe components of lease expense\nfor the years ended September 30 were as follows:\nShort-term lease expense and sublease income were immaterial for the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020. Cash paid for operating leases is classified within operating cash flows and was $\n192\nand $\n201\nfor the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Operating lease right-of-use asset additions was $\n194\nand $\n210\nfor the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n42\nThe following table summarizes the balances of the Company's operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2020 and 2021, the vast majority of which relates to offices and manufacturing facilities:\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases was\n5.8\nyears, and\n4.6\nyears and the weighted-average discount rate was\n2.6\npercent and\n2.8\npercent as of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively.\nFuture maturities of operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2021 are summarized below:\nLease commitments that have not yet commenced were immaterial as of September 30, 2021.\n(8)\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES\nThe change in the carrying value of goodwill by business segment follows:\nThe gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of identifiable intangible assets by major class follow:\n43\nIntangible a\nsset amortization expense for the major classes included above for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n470\n, $\n369\nand $\n359\n, respectively. Based on intangible asset balances as of September 30, 2021, amortization expense is expected to approximate $\n408\nin 2022, $\n379\nin 2023, $\n347\nin 2024, $\n306\nin 2025 and $\n274\nin 2026.\nThe increase in goodwill and intangible assets reflect the acquisition of Open Systems International, Inc.\n(9)\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nFollowing is a discussion regarding the Company’s use of financial instruments:\nHedging Activities\nAs of September 30, 2021, the notional amount of foreign currency hedge positions was approximately $\n2.0\nbillion, and commodity hedge contracts totaled approximately $\n137\n(primarily\n39\nmillion pounds of copper and aluminum). All derivatives receiving hedge accounting are cash flow hedges. The majority of hedging gains and losses deferred as of September 30, 2021 are expected to be recognized over the next 12 months as the underlying forecasted transactions occur. Gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives reported in Other deductions, net reflect hedges of balance sheet exposures that do not receive hedge accounting.\nNet Investment Hedge\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company issued euro-denominated debt of €\n1.5\nbillion. The euro notes reduce foreign currency risk associated with the Company's international subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency and have been designated as a hedge of a portion of the investment in these operations. Foreign currency gains or losses associated with the euro-denominated debt are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and will remain until the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated.\nThe following gains and losses are included in earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI):\nRegardless of whether derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments receive hedge accounting, the Company expects hedging gains or losses to be offset by losses or gains on the related underlying exposures. The amounts ultimately recognized will differ from those presented above for open positions, which remain subject to ongoing market price fluctuations until settlement. Derivatives receiving hedge accounting are highly effective and no amounts were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.\nFair Value Measurement\nValuations for all derivatives and the Company's long-term debt fall within Level 2 of the GAAP valuation hierarchy.     The fair value of long-term debt was $\n6.8\nbillion and $\n7.3\nbillion, respectively, as of September 30, 2021 and 2020, which exceeded the carrying value by $\n485\nand $\n629\n, respectively. The fair values of commodity and foreign currency contracts were reported in Other current assets and Accrued expenses as summarized below:\n44\n(10)\nSHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND LINES OF CREDIT\nShort-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt are as follows:\nIn May 2018, the Company entered into a $\n3.5\nbillion\nfive\n-year revolving backup credit facility with various banks, which replaced the April 2014 $\n3.5\nbillion facility. The credit facility is maintained to support general corporate purposes, including commercial paper borrowings. The Company has not incurred any borrowings under this or previous facilities. The credit facility contains no financial covenants and is not subject to termination based on a change of credit rating or material adverse changes. The facility is unsecured and may be accessed under various interest rate alternatives at the Company’s option. Fees to maintain the facility are immaterial.\n(11)\nLONG-TERM DEBT\nThe details of long-term debt follow:\nLong-term debt maturing during each of the four years after 2022 is $\n505\n, $\n592\n, $\n497\nand $\n577\n, respectively. Total interest paid on long-term debt was approximately $\n156\n, $\n163\nand $\n195\nin 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the year, the Company repaid $\n300\nof\n4.25\n% notes tha\nt matured in November 2020\n.\nIn 2020,\nthe Company repaid $\n500\nof\n4.875\n% notes that matured in October 2019. In April 2020, the Company issued $\n500\nof\n1.8\n% notes due October 2027, $\n500\nof\n1.95\n% notes due October 2030 and $\n500\nof\n2.75\n% notes due October 2050. In September 2020, the Company issued $\n750\nof\n0.875\n% notes due October 2026.\nThe Company maintains a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which it can issue debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, warrants, share purchase contracts or share purchase units without a predetermined limit. Securities can be sold in one or more separate offerings with the size, price and terms to be determined at the time of sale.\n45\n(12)  PENSION AND POST\nRETIREMENT PLANS\nRetirement plans expense includes the following components:\nNet periodic pension expense decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower interest cost. For defined contribution plans, the Company makes cash contributions based on plan requirements, which are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company's principal U.S. defined benefit plan is closed to employees hired after January 1, 2016 while shorter-tenured employees ceased accruing benefits effective October 1, 2016.\n46\nDetails of the changes in the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets for defined benefit pension plans follow:\nActuarial gains in 2021 were largely due to an increase in the discount rates used to estimate the benefit obligations for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans, which were\n2.92\n% and\n2.2\n% at September 30, 2021 compared to\n2.81\n% and\n1.9\n% at September 30, 2020, respectively. Actuarial losses in 2020 were largely due to a decrease in the discount rate used to estimate the benefit obligations for the U.S. plan, which was\n2.81\n% at September 30, 2020 compared to\n3.22\n% at September 30, 2019. As of September 30, 2021, U.S. pension plans were overfunded by $\n506\nin total, including unfunded plans totaling $\n220\n. The non-U.S. plans were underfunded by $\n88\n, including unfunded plans totaling $\n318\n.\nAs of the September 30, 2021 and 2020 measurement dates, the plans' total accumulated benefit obligation was $\n5,634\nand $\n5,859\n, respectively. The total projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for individual plans with projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $\n1,142\n, $\n1,016\nand $\n544\n, respectively, for 2021, and $\n1,200\n, $\n1,055\nand $\n527\n, respectively, for 2020. The total projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for individual plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $\n711\n, $\n626\nand $\n123\n, respectively, for 2021, and $\n1,153\n, $\n1,034\nand $\n492\n, respectively, for 2020.\nFuture benefit payments by U.S. plans are estimated to be $\n212\nin 2022, $\n217\nin 2023, $\n222\nin 2024, $\n227\nin 2025, $\n231\nin 2026 and $\n1,192\nin total over the five years 2027 through 2031. Based on foreign currency exchange rates as of September 30, 2021, future benefit payments by non-U.S. plans are estimated to be $\n68\nin 2022, $\n66\nin 2023, $\n70\nin 2024, $\n71\nin 2025, $\n74\nin 2026 and $\n415\nin total over the five years 2027 through 2031. The Company expects to contribute approximately $\n50\nto its retirement plans in 2022.\n47\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation of pension benefits follow:\nThe discount rate for the U.S. retirement plans was\n2.92\npercent as of September 30, 2021. An actuarially developed, company-specific yield curve is used to determine the discount rate. To determine the service and interest cost components of pension expense for its U.S. retirement plans, the Company applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve, rather than the single weighted-average rate, to the projected cash flows to provide more precise measurement of these costs. The expected return on plan assets assumption is determined by reviewing the investment returns of the plans for the past 10 years plus longer-term historical returns of an asset mix approximating the Company's asset allocation targets, and periodically comparing these returns to expectations of investment advisors and actuaries to determine whether long-term future returns are expected to differ significantly from the past.\nThe Company's asset allocations at September 30, 2021 and 2020, and weighted-average target allocations follow:\nThe primary objective for the investment of pension assets is to secure participant retirement benefits by earning a reasonable rate of return. Plan assets are invested consistent with the provisions of the prudence and diversification rules of ERISA and with a long-term investment horizon. The Company continuously monitors the value of assets by class and routinely rebalances to remain within target allocations. The equity strategy is to minimize concentrations of risk by investing primarily in a mix of companies that are diversified across geographies, market capitalization, style, sectors and industries worldwide. The approach for bonds emphasizes investment-grade corporate and government debt with maturities matching a portion of the longer duration pension liabilities. The bonds strategy also includes a high-yield element which is generally shorter in duration. For diversification, a small portion of U.S. plan assets is allocated to private equity partnerships and real asset fund investments, providing opportunities for above market returns. Leveraging techniques are not used and the use of derivatives in any fund is limited and inconsequential.\nThe fair values of defined benefit pension assets as of September 30, organized by asset class and by the fair value hierarchy of ASC 820,\nFair Value Measurement,\nfollow. Investments valued based on the net asset value (NAV) of fund units held, as derived from the fair value of the underlying assets, are excluded from the fair value hierarchy.\n48\nAsset Classes\nU.S. equities reflect companies domiciled in the U.S., including multinational companies. International equities are comprised of companies domiciled in developed nations outside the U.S.  Emerging market equities are comprised of companies domiciled in portions of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Corporate bonds represent investment-grade debt of issuers primarily from the U.S.  Government bonds include investment-grade instruments issued by federal, state and local governments, primarily in the U.S.  Other includes cash, interests in mixed asset funds investing in commodities, natural resources, agriculture, real estate and infrastructure funds, life insurance contracts (U.S.), and shares in certain general investment funds of financial institutions or insurance arrangements (non-U.S.) that typically ensure no market losses or provide for a small minimum return guarantee.\nFair Value Hierarchy Categories\nValuations of Level 1 assets for all classes are based on quoted closing market prices from the principal exchanges where the individual securities are traded. Cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Debt securities categorized as Level 2 assets are generally valued based on independent broker/dealer bids or by comparison to other debt securities having similar durations, yields and credit ratings. Valuation techniques and inputs for these assets include discounted cash flow analysis, earnings multiple approaches, recent transactions, transfer restrictions, prevailing discount rates, volatilities, credit ratings and other factors. In the Other class, interests in mixed asset funds are Level 2, and U.S. life insurance contracts and non-U.S. general fund investments and insurance arrangements are\nLevel 3. Investments measured at NAV are primarily nonexchange-traded commingled or collective funds where the underlying securities have observable prices available from active markets and typically provide liquidity daily or within a few days. The NAV category also includes fund investments in private equities, real estate and infrastructure where the fair value of the underlying assets is determined by the investment manager. Total unfunded commitments for the private equity funds were approximately\n$\n270\nat September 30, 2021. These investments cannot be redeemed, but instead the funds will make distributions through liquidation of the underlying assets, which is expected to occur over approximately the next\n10\nyears. The real estate and infrastructure funds typically offer quarterly redemption.\nPostretirement Plans\nThe Company also sponsors unfunded postretirement benefit plans (primarily health care) for certain U.S. retirees and their dependents. The Company’s principal U.S. postretirement plan has been frozen to new employees since 1993. The postretirement benefit liability for all plans was $\n119\nand $\n135\nas of September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and included deferred actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income of $\n98\nand $\n106\n, respectively. Service and interest costs are negligible and more than offset by the amortization of deferred actuarial gains, which resulted in net postretirement income of $\n15\nfor 2021 and $\n12\nfor 2020 and 2019. Benefits paid were\n49\n$\n9\nand $\n12\nfor 2021 and 2020, respectively, and the Company estimates that future health care benefit payments will be approximately $\n10\nper year for 2022 through 2026, and $\n38\nin total over the five years 2027 through 2031\n.\n(13)\nCONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS\nThe Company is a party to a number of pending legal proceedings and claims, including those involving general and product liability (including asbestos) and other matters, several of which claim substantial amounts of damages. The Company accrues for such liabilities when it is probable that future costs (including legal fees and expenses) will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are based on developments to date; management's estimates of the outcomes of these matters; and the Company's experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. The Company engages an outside expert to develop an actuarial estimate of its expected costs to resolve all pending and future asbestos claims, including defense costs, as well as its related insurance receivables. The reserve for asbestos litigation, which is recorded on an undiscounted basis, is based on projected claims through 2065. See Note 19 for additional information about the Company's asbestos liabilities and related insurance receivables.\nAlthough it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, the Company historically has been largely successful in defending itself against claims and suits that have been brought against it, and will continue to defend itself vigorously in all such matters. While the Company believes a material adverse impact is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future development could have a material adverse impact on the Company. The Company enters into certain indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business in which the indemnified party is held harmless and is reimbursed for losses incurred from claims by third parties, usually up to a prespecified limit. In connection with divestitures of certain assets or businesses, the Company often provides indemnities to the buyer with respect to certain matters including, for example, environmental or unidentified tax liabilities related to periods prior to the disposition. Because of the uncertain nature of the indemnities, the maximum liability cannot be quantified. As such, contingent liabilities are recorded when they are both probable and reasonably estimable. Historically, payments under indemnity arrangements have been inconsequential.\nAt September 30, 2021, there were\nno\nknown contingent liabilities (including guarantees, pending litigation, taxes and other claims) that management believes will be material in relation to the Company's financial statements, nor were there any material commitments outside the normal course of business.\n(14)\nINCOME TAXES\nPretax earnings consist of the following:\nThe principal components of income tax expense follow:\n50\nReconciliations of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the Company's effective tax rate follow.\nThe tax rates for 2021, 2020 and 2019 include benefits from restructuring subsidiaries of $\n13\n, $\n103\nand $\n74\n, respectively. The increase in research and development credits in 2020 was due to the impact of a research and development tax credit study.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and among other things, provides tax relief to businesses. Tax provisions of the CARES Act include the deferral of certain payroll taxes, relief for retaining employees, and other provisions. The Company deferred $\n73\nof certain payroll taxes through the end of calendar year 2020, half of which is due in December 2021 with the remainder due in December 2022.\nNon-U.S. tax holidays reduce tax rates in certain jurisdictions and are expected to expire over the next year.\nFollowing are changes in unrecognized tax benefits before considering recoverability of any cross-jurisdictional tax credits (U.S. federal, state and non-U.S.) and temporary differences. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is expected to be reduced by approximately\n$\n50\nin the next\n12\nmonths.\nIf none of the unrecognized tax benefits shown is ultimately paid, the tax provision and the calculation of the effective tax rate would be favorably impacted by $\n185\n, which is net of cross-jurisdictional tax credits and temporary differences. The Company accrues interest and penalties related to income taxes in income tax expense. Total expense (income) recognized from interest and penalties was $(\n4\n), $\n1\nand $\n4\nin 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, total accrued interest and penalties were $\n24\nand $\n29\n, respectively.\nThe U.S. is the major jurisdiction for which the Company files income tax returns. U.S. federal tax returns are closed by statute for years through 2013. The status of state and non-U.S. tax examinations varies due to the numerous legal entities and jurisdictions in which the Company operates.\n51\nThe principal items that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities follow:\nTotal income taxes paid were approximately $\n680\n, $\n400\nand $\n650\nin 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nApproximately half\nof the $\n316\nof net operating losses and tax credits expire over the next 10 years, while most of the remainder can be carried forward indefinitely.\n(15)\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company's stock-based compensation plans include performance shares, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock options. Although the Company has discretion, shares distributed under these plans are issued from treasury stock.\nTotal compensation expense and income tax benefits for stock options and incentive shares follows. The Company's performance shares awards are marked-to-market each period based on changes in the stock price.\nAs of September 30, 2021, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested shares awarded under these plans was $\n164\n, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.8\nyears.\nPerformance Shares, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\nThe Company's incentive shares plans include performance shares awards which distribute the value of common stock to key management employees at the conclusion of a three-year period subject to certain operating performance conditions and other terms and restrictions. The form of distribution is primarily shares of common stock, with a portion in cash in the first quarter following the end of the applicable three-year performance period.\n52\nDividend equivalents are only paid on earned awards after the performance period has concluded. Compensation expense for performance shares is recognized over the service period based on the number of shares ultimately expected to be earned. Performance shares awards are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 718,\nCompensation - Stock Compensation\n, with compensation expense adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect the change in fair value of the awards.\nInformation related to performance share payouts for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2021 follows (shares in thousands):\nAs of September 30, 2021, approximately\n1,327,000\nshares awarded primarily in 2019 were outstanding, contingent on the Company achieving its performance objectives through 2021. The objectives for these shares were met at the\n101\npercent level and the shares will be distributed in early 2022.\nAdditionally, the rights to receive approximately\n1,547,000\nand\n1,497,000\ncommon shares awarded in 2021 and 2020, respectively, are outstanding and contingent upon the Company achieving its performance objectives through 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncentive shares plans also include restricted stock awards and restricted stock units. Restricted stock awards involve distribution of common stock to key management employees subject to cliff vesting at the end of service periods ranging from three to ten years while restricted stock units granted to employees cliff vest at the end of a three-year period. The fair value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is determined based on the average of the high and low market prices of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, with compensation expense recognized ratably over the applicable vesting period. In 2021, approximately\n87,000\nshares of restricted stock vested as a result of participants fulfilling the applicable service requirements. Consequently, approximately\n57,000\nshares were issued while\n30,000\nshares were withheld for income taxes in accordance with minimum withholding requirements. As of September 30, 2021, there were approximately\n1,269,000\nshares of unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units outstanding.\nIn addition to the employee stock option and incentive shares plans, in 2021 the Company awarded approximately\n19,000\nshares of restricted stock and\n2,000\nrestricted stock units under the restricted stock plan for non-management directors. As of September 30, 2021, approximately\n99,000\nshares were available for issuance under this plan.\nAs of September 30, 2021,\n5.1\nmillion shares remained available for award under incentive shares plans.\nChanges in shares outstanding but not yet earned under incentive shares plans during the year ended September 30, 2021 follow (shares in thousands; assumes 100 percent payout of unvested awards):\n53\nInformation related to incentive shares plans follows:\nStock Options\nThere were no stock option grants in 2021, 2020 and 2019. The Company's stock option plan\ns expired in fiscal year 2021. Previously awarded stock options allow\nkey officers and employees to purchase common stock at specified prices, which are equal to\n100\npercent of the closing market price of the Company's stock on the date of grant. Options generally vest\none-third\nin each of the three years subsequent to grant and expire\n10\nyears from the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period based on the number of options expected to vest.\nChanges in shares subject to options during the year ended September 30, 2021 follow (shares in thousands):\nInformation related to stock options follows:\n(16)\nCOMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK\nAt September 30, 2021,\n13.7\nmillion shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the Company's stock-based compensation plans. During 2021,\n5.3\nmillion common shares were purchased and\n3.1\nmillion treasury shares were reissued. In 2020,\n16.4\nmillion common shares were purchased and\n3.4\nmillion treasury shares were reissued.\nAt September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had\n5.4\nmillion shares of $\n2.50\npar value preferred stock authorized, with\nnone\nissued.\n54\n(17)\nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\n(18)\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS INFORMATION\nThe Company designs and manufactures products and delivers services that bring technology and engineering together to provide innovative solutions for customers in a wide range of industrial, commercial and consumer markets around the world.

Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\n60\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nSufficiency of Audit Evidence over Net Sales\nAs discussed in Notes 1, 2 and 18 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, and disclosed in the consolidated statement of earnings, the Company recorded $18.2 billion of net sales in 2021.\nWe identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over net sales as a critical audit matter. Net sales are recognized primarily from the sale of tangible products from hundreds of Company locations around the world. Evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained required especially subjective auditor judgment because of the geographical dispersion of the Company’s net sales generating activities. This included determining the Company locations at which procedures were performed and the supervision and review of procedures performed at those locations.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over net sales, including the determination of the Company locations at which those procedures were to be performed. At each Company location where procedures were performed, we:\n•\nEvaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s net sales processes, including the Company’s controls over the accurate recording of amounts.\n•\nAssessed the recorded net sales by selecting a sample of transactions and compared the amounts recognized for consistency with underlying documentation, including contracts with customers and shipping documentation.\nWe evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed.\nWe or our predecessor firms have served as the Company’s auditor since 1938.\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nNovember 15, 2021\n61"

There was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2021, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s report on internal control over financial reporting, and the related report of the Company’s auditor, KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, set forth in Item 7 and Item 8, respectively, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are hereby incorporated by reference."
