    "text": "Introduction\nGoldman Sachs is a leading global financial institution that delivers a broad range of financial services across investment banking, securities, investment management and consumer banking to a large and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals. Our purpose is to advance sustainable economic growth and financial opportunity. Our goal, reflected in our One Goldman Sachs initiative, is to deliver the full range of our services and expertise to support our clients in a more accessible, comprehensive and efficient manner, across businesses and product areas.\nWhen we use the terms “Goldman Sachs,” “we,” “us” and “our,” we mean The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc. or parent company), a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we use the term “our subsidiaries,” we mean the consolidated subsidiaries of Group Inc. References to “this\nForm 10-K”\nare to our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020. All references to 2020, 2019 and 2018 refer to our years ended, or the dates, as the context requires, December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\nGroup Inc. is a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company (FHC) regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). Our U.S. depository institution subsidiary, Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA), is a New York State-chartered bank.\nOur Business Segments\nWe report our activities in four business segments: Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management, and Consumer & Wealth Management. Investment Banking generates revenues from financial advisory, underwriting and corporate lending activities. Global Markets consists of Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equities, and generates revenues from intermediation and financing activities. Asset Management generates revenues from management and other fees, incentive fees, equity investments, and lending and debt investments. Consumer & Wealth Management consists of Wealth management and Consumer banking, and generates revenues from management and other fees, incentive fees, private banking and lending, and consumer-oriented activities.\nThe chart below presents our four business segments and their revenue sources.\nInvestment Banking\nInvestment Banking serves public and private sector clients around the world. We provide financial advisory services, help companies raise capital to strengthen and grow their businesses and provide financing to corporate clients. We seek to develop and maintain long-term relationships with a diverse global group of institutional clients, including corporations, governments, states and municipalities. Our goal is to deliver to our institutional clients all of our resources in a seamless fashion, with investment banking serving as the main initial point of contact.\nInvestment Banking generates revenues from the following:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nEquity underwriting.\nWe underwrite common and preferred stock and convertible and exchangeable securities. We regularly receive mandates for large, complex transactions and have held a leading position in worldwide public common stock offerings and worldwide initial public offerings for many years.\nDebt underwriting.\nWe underwrite and originate various types of debt instruments, including investment-grade and high-yield debt, bank and bridge loans, including in connection with acquisition financing, and emerging- and growth-market debt, which may be issued by, among others, corporate, sovereign, municipal and agency issuers. In addition, we underwrite and originate structured securities, which include mortgage-related securities and other asset-backed securities.\nGlobal Markets\nGlobal Markets serves our clients who buy and sell financial products, raise funding and manage risk. We do this by acting as a market maker and offering market expertise on a global basis. Global Markets makes markets and facilitates client transactions in fixed income, equity, currency and commodity products. In addition, we make markets in, and clear client transactions on, major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide.\nAs a market maker, we provide prices to clients globally across thousands of products in all major asset classes and markets. At times, we take the other side of transactions ourselves if a buyer or seller is not readily available, and at other times we connect our clients to other parties who want to transact. Our willingness to make markets, commit capital and take risk in a broad range of products is crucial to our client relationships. Market makers provide liquidity and play a critical role in price discovery, which contributes to the overall efficiency of the capital markets. In connection with our market-making activities, we maintain (i) market-making positions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii) positions to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities (collectively, inventory).\nOur clients are institutions that are primarily professional market participants, including investment entities whose ultimate clients include individual investors investing for their retirement, buying insurance or saving surplus cash.\nWe execute a high volume of transactions for our clients in large, highly liquid markets (such as markets for U.S. Treasury securities, stocks and certain agency mortgage pass-through securities). We also execute transactions for our clients in less liquid markets (such as\nmid-cap\ncorporate bonds, emerging market currencies and certain\nnon-agency\nmortgage-backed securities) for spreads and fees that are generally somewhat larger than those charged in more liquid markets. Additionally, we structure and execute transactions involving customized or tailor-made products that address our clients’ risk exposures, investment objectives or other complex needs (such as a jet fuel hedge for an airline), as well as derivative transactions related to client advisory and underwriting activities.\nThrough our global sales force, we maintain relationships with our clients, receiving orders and distributing investment research, trading ideas, market information and analysis. Much of this connectivity between us and our clients is maintained on technology platforms, including\nMarquee\n, and operates globally where markets are open for trading.\nMarquee\nprovides institutional investors with market intelligence, risk analytics, proprietary datasets and trade execution across multiple asset classes.\nGlobal Markets and our other businesses are supported by our Global Investment Research division, which, as of December 2020, provided fundamental research on approximately 3,000 companies worldwide and approximately 50 national economies, as well as on industries, currencies and commodities.\nGlobal Markets activities are organized by asset class and include both “cash” and “derivative” instruments. “Cash” refers to trading the underlying instrument (such as a stock, bond or barrel of oil). “Derivative” refers to instruments that derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other inputs, or a combination of these factors (such as an option, which is the right or obligation to buy or sell a certain bond, stock or other asset on a specified date in the future at a certain price, or an interest rate swap, which is the agreement to convert a fixed rate of interest into a floating rate or vice versa).\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGlobal Markets consists of FICC and Equities.\nFICC.\nFICC generates revenues from intermediation and financing activities.\nInterest Rate Products.\nGovernment bonds (including inflation-linked securities) across maturities, other government-backed securities, and interest rate swaps, options and other derivatives.\nCredit Products.\nInvestment-grade and high-yield corporate securities, credit derivatives, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), bank and bridge loans, municipal securities, emerging market and distressed debt, and trade claims.\nMortgages.\nCommercial mortgage-related securities, loans and derivatives, residential mortgage-related securities, loans and derivatives (including U.S. government agency-issued collateralized mortgage obligations and other securities and loans), and other asset-backed securities, loans and derivatives.\nCurrencies.\nCurrency options, spot/forwards and other derivatives on\nG-10\ncurrencies and emerging-market products.\nCommodities.\nCommodity derivatives and, to a lesser extent, physical commodities, involving crude oil and petroleum products, natural gas, base, precious and other metals, electricity, coal, agricultural and other commodity products.\nEquities.\nEquities generates revenues from intermediation and financing activities.\nWe also structure and make markets in derivatives on indices, industry sectors, financial measures and individual company stocks. We develop strategies and provide information about portfolio hedging and restructuring and asset allocation transactions for our clients. We also work with our clients to create specially tailored instruments to enable sophisticated investors to establish or liquidate investment positions or undertake hedging strategies. We are one of the leading participants in the trading and development of equity derivative instruments.\nOur exchange-based market-making activities include making markets in stocks and ETFs, futures and options on major exchanges worldwide.\nWe generate commissions and fees from executing and clearing institutional client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide, as well as OTC transactions. We provide our clients with access to a broad spectrum of equity execution services, including electronic\n“low-touch”\naccess and more complex “high-touch” execution through both traditional and electronic platforms, including\nMarquee\n.\nWe earn fees by providing clearing, settlement and custody services globally. In addition, we provide our hedge fund and other clients with a technology platform and reporting that enables them to monitor their security portfolios and manage risk exposures.\nWe provide services that principally involve borrowing and lending securities to cover institutional clients’ short sales and borrowing securities to cover our short sales and to make deliveries into the market. In addition, we are an active participant in\nbroker-to-broker\nsecurities lending and third-party agency lending activities.\nWe provide financing to our clients for their securities trading activities through margin loans that are collateralized by securities, cash or other acceptable collateral. We earn a spread equal to the difference between the amount we pay for funds and the amount we receive from our client.\nWe execute swap transactions to provide our clients with exposure to securities and indices.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nAsset Management\nAsset Management provides investment services to help clients preserve and grow their financial assets. We provide these services to our institutional clients, as well as investors who primarily access our products through a network of third-party distributors around the world.\nWe manage client assets across a broad range of investment strategies and asset classes, including equity, fixed income and alternative investments. Alternative investments primarily includes hedge funds, credit funds, private equity, real estate, currencies, commodities and asset allocation strategies. Our investment offerings include those managed on a fiduciary basis by our portfolio managers, as well as strategies managed by third-party managers. We offer our investments in a variety of structures, including separately managed accounts, mutual funds, private partnerships and other commingled vehicles.\nWe also provide customized investment advisory solutions designed to address our clients’ investment needs. These solutions begin with identifying clients’ objectives and continue through portfolio construction, ongoing asset allocation and risk management and investment realization. We draw from a variety of third-party managers, as well as our proprietary offerings, to implement solutions for clients.\nAsset Management generates revenues from the following:\nConsumer & Wealth Management\nConsumer & Wealth Management helps clients achieve their individual financial goals by providing a broad range of wealth advisory and banking services, including financial planning, investment management, deposit taking, and lending. Services are offered through our global network of advisors and via our digital platforms.\nWealth Management.\nWealth Management provides tailored wealth advisory services to clients across the wealth spectrum. We operate globally serving individuals, families, family offices, and foundations and endowments. Our relationships are established directly or introduced through corporations that sponsor financial wellness programs for their employees.\nWe offer personalized financial planning inclusive of income and liability management, compensation and benefits analysis, trust and estate structuring, tax optimization, philanthropic giving, and asset protection. We also provide customized investment advisory solutions, and offer structuring and execution capabilities in security and derivative products across all major global markets. We leverage a broad, open-architecture investment platform and our global execution capabilities to help clients achieve their investment goals. In addition, we offer clients a full range of private banking services, including a variety of deposit alternatives and loans that our clients use to finance investments in both financial and nonfinancial assets, bridge cash flow timing gaps or provide liquidity and flexibility for other needs.\nWealth management generates revenues from the following:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsumer Banking.\nWe engage in consumer-oriented businesses. We issue unsecured loans, through our digital platform,\nMarcus by Goldman Sachs\n(Marcus), and credit cards, to finance the purchases of goods or services. We also accept deposits through Marcus, in GS Bank USA and Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB). These deposits include savings and time deposits which provide us with a diversified source of funding.\nConsumer banking revenues consist of net interest income earned on unsecured loans issued to consumers through Marcus and credit card lending activities, and net interest income allocated to consumer deposits.\nBusiness Continuity and Information Security\nBusiness continuity and information security, including cyber security, are high priorities for us. Their importance has been highlighted by (i) the coronavirus\n(COVID-19)\npandemic and the work-from-home arrangements implemented by companies worldwide in response, including us, (ii) numerous highly publicized events in recent years, including cyber attacks against financial institutions, governmental agencies, large consumer-based companies and other organizations that resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of personal information and other sensitive or confidential information, the theft and destruction of corporate information and requests for ransom payments, and (iii) extreme weather events.\nOur Business Continuity & Technology Resilience Program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity in the event of disruptions at our critical facilities or of our systems, and to comply with regulatory requirements, including those of FINRA. Because we are a BHC, our Business Continuity & Technology Resilience Program is also subject to review by the FRB. The key elements of the program are crisis management, business continuity, technology resilience, business recovery, assurance and verification, and process improvement. In the area of information security, we have developed and implemented a framework of principles, policies and technology designed to protect the information provided to us by our clients and our own information from cyber attacks and other misappropriation, corruption or loss. Safeguards are designed to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. For further information about the Business Continuity Planning strategy we have implemented in response to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Regulatory and Other Matters — Impact of\nCOVID-19\nPandemic” in Part II, Item 7 of this\nForm 10-K.\nHuman Capital Management\nOur people are our greatest asset. We believe that a major strength and principal reason for our success is the quality, dedication, determination and collaboration of our people, which enables us to serve our clients, generate long-term value for our shareholders and contribute to the broader community. We invest heavily in developing and supporting our people throughout their careers, and we strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism, excellence, high standards of business ethics, diversity, teamwork and cooperation among our employees worldwide.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nThe strength of our culture, our ability to execute our strategy, and our relationships with clients all depend on a diverse workforce and an inclusive work environment that encourages a wide range of perspectives. We believe that employee diversity at all levels of our businesses, from entry-level analysts to senior management, is essential to our sustainability. Our management team works closely with our Global Inclusion and Diversity Committee to continue to increase diversity of our global workforce at all levels. In addition, we also have regional Inclusion and Diversity Committees which promote an environment that values different perspectives, challenges conventional thinking and maximizes the potential of all our people.\nWe believe that increased diversity, including diversity of experience, gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and veteran status, in addition to being a social imperative, is vital to our commercial success through the creativity that it fosters. For this reason, we have established a comprehensive action plan with aspirational diversity hiring goals which are set forth below and are focused on cultivating an inclusive environment for all our colleagues.\nDiverse leadership is crucial to our long-term success and to driving innovation, and we have implemented and expanded outreach and career advancement programs for rising diverse executive talent. A prime example is our Managing Director Retention Initiative, which includes sponsorship and the creation of career development plans for newly promoted diverse managing directors. We are also focused on providing diverse vice presidents the necessary coaching, sponsorship and advocacy to support their career trajectories and strengthen their leadership platforms, including through programs such as our Asian Talent Initiative. Many other career development initiatives are aimed at fostering diverse talent at the analyst and associate level, including the Black Analyst and Associate Initiative, the Hispanic/Latinx Analysts Initiative and the Women’s Career Strategies Initiative. We have also established Inclusion Networks and Interest Forums that are open to all professionals at Goldman Sachs to promote and advance connectivity, understanding, inclusion and diversity.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReflecting our efforts to increase diversity, the composition of our most recent partnership class was 27% women, 17% Asian, 7% Black and 5% Hispanic/Latinx, and our most recent managing director class was 29% women, 26% Asian, 4% Black and 2% Hispanic/Latinx. In addition, our 2020 campus analyst class in the Americas was 55% women, 31% Asian, 17% Hispanic/Latinx and 11% Black. These metrics are based on self-identification.\nAspirational Goals.\nWe have set the following aspirational goals:\nTalent Development and Retention\nWe seek to help our people achieve their full potential by investing in them and supporting a culture of continuous development. Our goals are to maximize individual capabilities, increase commercial effectiveness and innovation, reinforce our culture, expand professional opportunities, and help our people contribute positively to their communities.\nInstilling our culture in all employees is a continuous process, in which training plays an important part. We offer our employees the opportunity to participate in ongoing educational offerings and periodic seminars through Goldman Sachs University (GSU). To accelerate their integration into the firm and our culture, new hires have the opportunity to receive training before they start working and orientation programs with an emphasis on culture and networking, and nearly all employees participate in at least one training event each year. For our more senior employees, we provide guidance and training on how to manage people and projects effectively, exhibit strong leadership and exemplify the firm’s culture. We are also focused on developing a high performing, diverse leadership pipeline and career planning for our next generation of leaders.\nAnother important part of instilling our culture is our employee performance review process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors,\nco-workers\nand employees whom they supervise in a\n360-degree\nreview process that is integral to our team approach and includes an evaluation of an employee’s performance with respect to risk management, protecting our reputation, adherence to our code of conduct, compliance, and diversity and inclusion principles. Our approach to evaluating employee performance centers on providing robust, timely and actionable feedback that facilitates professional development. We have directed our managers, as leaders at the firm, to take an active coaching role with their teams. In 2021, we implemented “The Three Conversations at GS” through which managers establish goals with their team members at the start of the year, check in\nmid-year\non progress and then close out the year with a conversation on performance against goals.\nWe believe that our people value opportunities to contribute to their communities and that these opportunities enhance their job satisfaction. We also believe that being able to volunteer together with colleagues and participate in community organizations working on local service projects strengthens our people’s bond with us. Community TeamWorks, our signature volunteering initiative, enables our people to participate in high-impact, team-based volunteer opportunities, including projects coordinated with hundreds of nonprofit partner organizations worldwide. During 2019, our people volunteered over 150,000 hours of service globally through Community TeamWorks, with more than 26,000 employees partnering with approximately 900 nonprofit organizations on over 1,800 community projects. To respond to the interest of our people in helping with the response to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, we developed a series of opportunities during 2020 to support vulnerable populations remotely, including small business owners, students and the elderly.\nWellness\nWe recognize that for our people to be successful in the workplace they need support in their personal, as well as their professional lives. We have created a strong support framework for wellness, which is intended to enable employees to better balance their roles at work and their responsibilities at home. We have recently made significant additions to this framework, including increasing parental leave to 20 weeks for all employees. We also continue to advance our resilience programs, offering our people a range of counseling, coaching, medical advisory and personal wellness services. We have increased the availability of these resources during the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, and we have continued to evolve and strengthen virtual offerings with the aim of maintaining the physical and mental well-being of our employees, enhancing their effectiveness and cohesiveness and providing them with greater opportunities to access support.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe also introduced a\nCOVID-19\n10-day\nfamily leave policy, available to our people globally to care for family members due to\nCOVID-19\nrelated illness or meet childcare needs, including homeschooling.\nGlobal Reach and Strategic Locations\nAs a firm with a global client base, we take a strategic approach to attracting, developing and managing a global workforce. Our clients are located worldwide and we are an active participant in financial markets around the world. As of December 2020, we had headcount of 40,500, offices in over 35 countries and 53% of our headcount was based in the Americas, 19% in EMEA and 28% in Asia. Our employees come from over 160 countries and speak more than 110 languages as of December 2020.\nIn addition to maintaining offices in major financial centers around the world, we have established key strategic locations, including in Bengaluru, Salt Lake City, Dallas, Singapore and Warsaw. We continue to evaluate the expanded use of strategic locations, including cities in which we do not currently have a presence.\nAs of December 2020, 36% of our employees were working in one of these key strategic locations, and our goal is to increase this percentage to approximately 40% by the end of 2022. We believe our investment in these strategic locations enables us to build centers of excellence around specific capabilities that support our business initiatives.\nCompetition\nThe financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. Our competitors are other entities that provide investment banking (including transaction banking), market-making, investment management services, commercial and/or consumer lending, deposit-taking and other banking products and services, as well as those entities that make investments in securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and other financial assets. These entities include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, credit card issuers, insurance companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds, merchant banks, consumer finance companies and financial technology and other internet-based companies. We compete with some entities globally and with others on a regional, product or niche basis. We compete based on a number of factors, including transaction execution, client experience, products and services, innovation, reputation and price.\nWe have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate in their loan facilities) from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments.\nConsolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors, and have also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. To capitalize on some of our most significant opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and have more capital and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the U.S.\nWe also compete with smaller institutions that offer more targeted services, such as independent advisory firms. Some clients may perceive these firms to be less susceptible to potential conflicts of interest than we are, and, as described below, our ability to effectively compete with them could be affected by regulations and limitations on activities that apply to us but may not apply to them.\nA number of our businesses are subject to intense price competition. Efforts by our competitors to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking, market-making, lending and asset management businesses. For example, the increasing volume of trades executed electronically, through the internet and through alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that commissions for electronic trading are generally lower than those for\nnon-electronic\ntrading. It appears that this trend toward\nlow-commission\ntrading will continue. Price competition has also led to compression in the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it (i.e., bid/offer spread), which has affected our market-making businesses. The increasing prevalence of passive investment strategies that typically have lower fees than other strategies we offer has affected the competitive and pricing dynamics for our asset management products and services. In addition, we believe that we will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices, and as we enter into or expand our presence in markets that may rely more heavily on electronic trading and execution.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe also compete on the basis of the types of financial products and client experiences that we and our competitors offer. In some circumstances, our competitors may offer financial products that we do not offer and that our clients may prefer, or our competitors may develop technology platforms that provide a better client experience.\nThe provisions of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the requirements promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and other financial regulations could affect our competitive position to the extent that limitations on activities, increased fees and compliance costs or other regulatory requirements do not apply, or do not apply equally, to all of our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across different jurisdictions. For example, the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that prohibit proprietary trading and restrict investments in certain hedge and private equity funds differentiate between U.S.-based and\nnon-U.S.-based\nbanking organizations and give\nnon-U.S.-based\nbanking organizations greater flexibility to trade outside of the U.S. and to form and invest in funds outside the U.S. Likewise, the obligations with respect to derivative transactions under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act depend, in part, on the location of the counterparties to the transaction.\nThe impact of regulatory developments on our competitive position has depended and will continue to depend to a large extent on the manner in which the required rulemaking and regulatory guidance evolve, the extent of international convergence, and the development of market practice and structures under the evolving regulatory regimes, as described further in “Regulation” below.\nWe also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively has depended and will continue to depend upon our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees and to continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of large financial institutions. Our pay practices and those of certain of our competitors are subject to review by, and the standards of, the FRB and other regulators inside and outside the U.S., including the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the U.K. We also compete for employees with institutions whose pay practices are not subject to regulatory oversight. See “Regulation — Compensation Practices” and “Risk Factors — Competition — Our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees” in Part I, Item 1A of this\nForm 10-K\nfor further information about such regulation.\nRegulation\nAs a participant in the global financial services industry, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision worldwide. The regulatory regimes applicable to our operations worldwide have recently been, and continue to be, subject to significant changes. The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for prudential bank regulation; however, its standards do not become effective in a jurisdiction until the relevant regulators have adopted rules to implement its standards. The implications of these regulations for our businesses depend to a large extent on their implementation by the relevant regulators globally, and the market practices and structures that develop.\nNew regulations have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide, as described below. The effects of any changes to the regulations affecting our businesses, including as a result of the proposals described below, are uncertain and will not be known until such changes are finalized and market practices and structures develop under the revised regulations.\nOur principal subsidiaries operating in Europe include Goldman Sachs International (GSI), GSIB and Goldman Sachs Asset Management International (GSAMI), which are incorporated and headquartered in the U.K., and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE), which is incorporated and headquartered in Germany. As a result of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the E.U. (Brexit), the regulatory framework that governs transactions and business undertaken by our U.K. subsidiaries has changed, especially in connection with transactions and business relating to the E.U.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe E.U. and the U.K. agreed to a withdrawal agreement (the Withdrawal Agreement), which became effective on January 31, 2020 when the U.K. ceased to be an E.U. member state. The transition period under the Withdrawal Agreement ended on December 31, 2020. During the transition period, the U.K. was treated as if it were a member state of the E.U. and therefore our U.K. subsidiaries benefitted from\nnon-discriminatory\naccess to E.U. clients and infrastructure. Effective on December 31, 2020, and notwithstanding the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the E.U. and the U.K. reached at the end of 2020, firms established in the U.K., including our U.K. subsidiaries, have lost their\npan-E.U.\n“passports” and are generally treated as any other entities in countries outside the E.U., whose access to the E.U. is governed by E.U. and national law and depends on the making of E.U. equivalence decisions or on their obtaining licenses or exemptions under national regimes. The U.K. has adopted E.U. financial services legislation that was in effect at December 31, 2020. This means that the U.K. financial services regime will remain substantially the same as under E.U. financial services legislation, but in the future the U.K. may diverge from E.U. legislation and may decide not to adopt rules that correspond to E.U. legislation not already operative in the U.K. We have strengthened the capabilities of our operating subsidiaries in E.U. countries, particularly GSBE, and have moved certain activities there, including moving a number of relationships with clients of our Investment Banking, Global Markets and Wealth Management businesses from GSI and GSIB to GSBE, and clients of our Asset Management business from GSAMI to GSBE; establishing access for GSBE to exchanges, clearing houses and depositories and other market infrastructure in the E.U.; establishing branches of GSBE in nine E.U. member states and in the U.K.; and strengthening the capital, personnel and other resources at GSBE.\nBanking Supervision and Regulation\nGroup Inc. is a BHC under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act) and an FHC under amendments to the BHC Act effected by the U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLB Act), and is subject to supervision and examination by the FRB, which is our primary regulator.\nThe FRB has a rating system for large financial institutions that is intended to align with its supervisory program. It consists of component ratings for capital planning and positions, liquidity risk management and positions, and governance and controls. The FRB has proposed guidance for the governance and controls component.\nUnder the system of “functional regulation” established under the BHC Act, the primary regulators of our U.S.\nnon-bank\nsubsidiaries directly regulate the activities of those subsidiaries, with the FRB exercising a supervisory role. Such “functionally regulated” subsidiaries include broker-dealers registered with the SEC, such as our principal U.S. broker-dealer, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), entities registered with or regulated by the CFTC with respect to futures-related and swaps-related activities and investment advisers registered with the SEC with respect to their investment advisory activities.\nOur principal U.S. bank subsidiary, GS Bank USA, is supervised and regulated by the FRB, the FDIC, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). GS Bank USA also has a branch in London, which is regulated by the FCA and PRA. A number of our activities are conducted partially or entirely through GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries, including: corporate loans (including leveraged lending); consumer loans (including installment and credit card loans) and wealth management loans (including mortgages); interest rate, credit, currency and other derivatives; deposit-taking; and agency lending.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCertain of our subsidiaries are regulated by the banking and securities regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate. GSI, our U.K. broker-dealer subsidiary and a designated investment firm, and GSIB, our U.K. bank subsidiary, are regulated by the PRA and the FCA. GSI provides broker-dealer services in and from the U.K., and GSIB acts as a primary dealer for U.K. government bonds and is involved in lending (including securities lending) and deposit-taking activities. As described below, our E.U. subsidiaries are subject to various E.U. regulations, as well as national laws, including those implementing European directives. GSI maintains branches as a\nnon-E.U.\ninvestment firm in Madrid, Paris and Stockholm and GSIB maintains a branch in Frankfurt. GSIB also maintains a branch in Johannesburg, South Africa, which is regulated by the Prudential Authority, the Financial Surveillance Department of the South African Reserve Bank and the Financial Sector Conduct Authority. GSBE is directly supervised by the European Central Bank (ECB) and additionally by BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank in the context of the E.U. Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). Goldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie (GSPIC), an investment firm regulated by the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority and Financial Markets Regulator, may, among other activities, conduct activities that GSBE is prevented from undertaking. Certain of our\nnon-E.U.\nsubsidiaries also maintain cross-border licenses or exemptions as\nnon-E.U.\ninstitutions in E.U. jurisdictions where permitted by domestic legislation.\nCapital and Liquidity Requirements.\nWe and GS Bank USA are subject to regulatory risk-based capital and leverage requirements that are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). The Capital Framework is largely based on the Basel Committee’s framework for strengthening the regulation, supervision and risk management of banks (Basel III) and also implements certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the tailoring rules adopted by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies in October 2019, we and GS Bank USA are subject to “Category I” standards because we have been designated as a global systemically important bank\n(G-SIB).\nAccordingly, under the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA are “Advanced approach” banking organizations. Under the FRB’s capital adequacy requirements, we and GS Bank USA must meet specific regulatory capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain\noff-balance\nsheet items. The sufficiency of our capital levels is also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. We and GS Bank USA are also subject to liquidity requirements established by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies.\nGSBE is subject to capital requirements prescribed in the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the E.U. Fourth Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV), which are largely based on Basel III. GSBE is subject to liquidity requirements established by E.U. authorities, which are similar to those applicable to GS Bank USA and us. Following the end of the Brexit transition period, from December 31, 2020, GSI and GSIB have become subject to the U.K. capital framework, which is predominantly aligned with the E.U. capital framework.\nAmendments to the CRR and CRD IV (respectively, CRR II and CRD V) were finalized in June 2019. CRR II, which includes changes to the market risk, large exposures and leverage ratio frameworks will be applicable from June 2021 in the E.U., and from January 2022 in the U.K. GSI and GSAMI will be subject to a new prudential regime for U.K. investment firms which is expected to be introduced on January 1, 2022.\nRisk-Based Capital Ratios.\nThe Capital Framework provides for additional capital ratio requirements for Group Inc., consisting of the capital conservation buffer requirements, comprised of a 2.5% buffer (under the Advanced Capital Rules), a stress capital buffer (under the Standardized Capital Rules), and a countercyclical buffer and the\nG-SIB\nsurcharge (under both Capital Rules). For GS Bank USA, the capital conservation buffer requirements include a 2.5% buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer. These additional requirements must be satisfied entirely with capital that qualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital.\nThe SCB is based on the results of the Federal Reserve’s supervisory stress tests, and our planned common stock dividends. The countercyclical capital buffer is designed to counteract systemic vulnerabilities and currently applies only to banking organizations subject to Category I, II or III standards, including us. Several other national supervisors also require countercyclical capital buffers. The\nG-SIB\nsurcharge and countercyclical capital buffer applicable to us could change in the future. As a result, the minimum capital ratios to which we are subject are likely to change over time.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDuring 2020, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies adopted a rule that allows banking organizations, including us and GS Bank USA, to elect to temporarily delay the estimated effects of adopting the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) accounting standard on regulatory capital until January 2022 and to subsequently\nphase-in\nthe effects through January 2025. The FRB has also stated that it will not incorporate CECL into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses in supervisory stress tests through the 2021 stress test cycle. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K\nfor further information about CECL.\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies adopted a rule in November 2019 that will implement the Basel Committee’s standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures in connection with derivative contracts\n(SA-CCR).\nUnder the rule, beginning January 1, 2022, but with the option to adopt starting April 1, 2020, “Advanced approach” banking organizations will be required to use\nSA-CCR\nfor purposes of calculating their standardized risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and, with some adjustments, for purposes of determining their supplementary leverage ratios (SLRs) discussed below.\nThe Basel Committee standards include guidelines for calculating incremental capital ratio requirements for banking institutions that are systemically significant from a domestic but not global perspective\n(D-SIBs).\nWhen these guidelines are implemented by national regulators, they may apply, among others, to certain subsidiaries of\nG-SIBs.\nThese guidelines are in addition to the framework for\nG-SIBs,\nbut are more principles-based. CRD V and CRR II provide that institutions that are systemically important at the E.U. or member state level, known as other systemically important institutions\n(O-SIIs),\nmay be subject to additional capital ratio requirements of up to 3% of CET1, according to their degree of systemic importance\n(O-SII\nbuffers). The designated authority may impose an\nO-SII\nbuffer that is greater than 3% in certain cases. CRD IV and the CRR currently provide for an additional requirement of up to 2%.\nO-SIIs\nare identified annually, along with their applicable buffers. The PRA has identified Goldman Sachs Group UK Limited (GSG UK), the parent company of GSI and GSIB, as an\nO-SII.\nGSG UK’s\nO-SII\nbuffer is currently set at zero percent.\nIn January 2019, the Basel Committee finalized revisions to the framework for calculating capital requirements for market risk, which is expected to increase market risk capital requirements for most banking organizations and large broker-dealers subject to bank capital requirements. The revised framework, among other things, revises the standardized and internal models approaches used to calculate market risk requirements and clarifies the scope of positions subject to market risk capital requirements. The Basel Committee framework contemplates that national regulators implement the revised framework by January 1, 2023. CRR II, which became effective in June 2019 and establishes a reporting standard, will become applicable in the third quarter of 2021. The U.K. has adopted the reporting standard set out in CRR II but has not stated when it will become applicable. E.U. financial institutions are to report their market risk calculations under the revised framework as early as January 1, 2021. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing the 2019 version of the revised market risk framework.\nThe Basel Committee published standards in December 2017 that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms. These standards set a floor on internally modeled capital requirements at a percentage of the capital requirements under the standardized approach. They also revise the Basel Committee’s standardized and internal model-based approaches for credit risk, provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital and revise the frameworks for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk. The Basel Committee framework contemplates that national regulators implement these standards by January 1, 2023, and that the new floor be phased in through January 1, 2028. In July 2020, the Basel Committee finalized further revisions to the framework for CVA risk, which are intended to align that framework with the market risk framework.\nThe Basel Committee has also published updated frameworks relating to Pillar 3 disclosure requirements and the regulatory capital treatment of securitization exposures and a revised\nG-SIB\nassessment methodology. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have not yet proposed rules implementing these Basel Committee frameworks or the December 2017 standards for purposes of risk-based capital ratios.\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital” in Part II, Item 7 of this\nForm 10-K\nand Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K\nfor information about our capital ratios and those of GS Bank USA and GSI.\nAs described in “Other Restrictions” below, in September 2016, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would, among other things, require FHCs to hold additional capital in connection with covered physical commodity activities.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nLeverage Ratios.\nUnder the Capital Framework, we and GS Bank USA are subject to Tier 1 leverage ratios and SLRs established by the FRB. In April 2018, the FRB and the OCC issued a proposed rule which would replace the current 2% SLR buffer for\nG-SIBs,\nincluding us, with a buffer equal to 50% of their\nG-SIB\nsurcharge. This proposal, together with the adopted rule requiring use of\nSA-CCR\nfor purposes of calculating the SLR, would implement certain of the revisions to the leverage ratio framework published by the Basel Committee in December 2017.\nThe Basel Committee standards provide for the public disclosure of average daily balances for certain components of leverage ratio calculations.\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies’ rule implementing\nSA-CCR\nallows for greater recognition of collateral in the calculation of total leverage exposure relating to client-cleared derivative contracts.\nCRR II establishes a 3% minimum leverage ratio requirement for certain E.U. financial institutions, including GSBE. This requirement will be applicable beginning in June 2021. Following Brexit, GSI and GSIB will become subject to a similar\nPRA-required\nleverage ratio that is expected to become effective in January 2022.\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital” in Part II, Item 7 of this\nForm 10-K\nand Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K\nfor information about our and GS Bank USA’s Tier 1 leverage ratios and SLRs, and GSI’s leverage ratio.\nLiquidity Ratios.\nThe Basel Committee’s framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring requires banking organizations to measure their liquidity against two specific liquidity tests: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).\nThe LCR rule issued by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies and applicable to both us and GS Bank USA is generally consistent with the Basel Committee’s framework and is designed to ensure that a banking organization maintains an adequate level of unencumbered, high-quality liquid assets equal to or greater than the expected net cash outflows under an acute short-term liquidity stress scenario. We are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. We disclose, on a quarterly basis, our average daily LCR. See “Available Information” below and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital” in Part II, Item 7 of this\nForm 10-K\nfor information about our average daily LCR.\nThe LCR rule issued by the European Commission, which was incorporated into the U.K. prudential framework and is applicable to GSI, GSIB and GSBE, is also generally consistent with the Basel Committee’s framework.\nThe NSFR is designed to promote medium- and long-term stable funding of the assets and\noff-balance\nsheet activities of banking organizations over a\none-year\ntime horizon. The Basel Committee’s NSFR framework requires banking organizations to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%.\nIn October 2020, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule implementing the NSFR for large U.S. banking organizations, including us and GS Bank USA. The final rule will become effective on July 1, 2021, and we will be required to publicly disclose our NSFR levels semiannually beginning in 2023. CRR II implements the NSFR for certain E.U. financial institutions, including GSBE. This requirement will be applicable beginning in June 2021. Following the U.K.’s withdrawal from the E.U. on December 31, 2020, GSI and GSIB have become subject to the NSFR requirement implemented in the U.K., which is expected to become effective in January 2022.\nThe FRB’s enhanced prudential standards require BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards, which include maintaining a level of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for 30 days, and increased involvement by boards of directors in liquidity and overall risk management. Although the liquidity requirement under these rules has some similarities to the LCR, it is a separate requirement. GSI and GSIB have their own liquidity planning process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of the PRA’s Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). GSBE also has its own liquidity planning process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under German regulatory requirements and the ECB Guide to ILAAP.\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management — Overview and Structure of Risk Management” and “— Liquidity Risk Management” in Part II, Item 7 of this\nForm 10-K\nfor information about the LCR and NSFR, as well as our risk management practices and liquidity.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nStress Tests.\nAs required by the FRB’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) rules, we submit an annual capital plan for review by the FRB. In June 2020, all BHCs participating in CCAR 2020, including us, were required by the FRB to resubmit their capital plans in November 2020 in light of the ongoing economic effects of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic. In addition, we are required to perform\ncompany-run\nstress tests on an annual basis. As described in “Available Information” below, we publish summaries of our stress tests results on our website.\nOur annual stress test submission is incorporated into the annual capital plans that we submit to the FRB as part of the CCAR process for large BHCs, which is designed to ensure that capital planning processes will permit continued operations by such institutions during times of economic and financial stress. As part of CCAR, the FRB evaluates an institution’s plan to make capital distributions, such as by repurchasing or redeeming stock or making dividend payments, across a range of macroeconomic and company-specific assumptions based on the institution’s and the FRB’s stress tests.\nIn March 2020, the FRB approved a final rule replacing the static 2.5% component of the capital conservation buffer, under the Standardized approach capital rules, with the SCB for BHCs with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The SCB reflects stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the FRB’s CCAR stress tests and includes four quarters of planned common stock dividends. The SCB is subject to a 2.5% floor and is generally effective on October 1 of each year and remains in effect until October 1 of the following year, unless the SCB is reset in connection with a resubmission of a capital plan. Our first SCB requirement of 6.6% took effect on October 1, 2020.\nDepository institutions with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more that are subsidiaries of U.S.\nG-SIBs\nare required to submit annual\ncompany-run\nstress test results to the FRB. Based on growth in its balance sheet, GS Bank USA will be required to submit its annual stress test results in 2022. Depository institutions not subject to\ncompany-run\nstress testing requirements are still required to have their own capital planning process. GSI and GSIB have their own capital planning and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of the PRA’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). GSBE also has its own capital and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests and those required under German regulatory requirements and the ECB Guide to ICAAP.\nDividends and Stock Repurchases.\nDividend payments to our shareholders and our stock repurchases are subject to the oversight of the FRB.\nThe final rule implementing the SCB provides that a BHC must receive prior approval for any dividend, stock repurchase or other capital distribution, other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument, if the BHC is required to resubmit its capital plan. In connection with the November 2020 resubmission described above under “Stress Tests,” the FRB required those BHCs to suspend stock repurchases during the third and fourth quarters of 2020 and not to increase common stock dividends or pay common stock dividends in excess of their average net income over the prior four quarters. In December 2020, the FRB announced that it would require BHCs not to increase common stock dividends and would permit common stock dividends and stock repurchases that, in the aggregate, do not exceed a BHC’s average net income over the prior four quarters, as well as stock repurchases equal to the amount of share issuances related to expensed employee compensation. We suspended stock repurchases during the first quarter of 2020 and, consistent with the FRB’s requirement for all large BHCs, extended the suspension of stock repurchases through the fourth quarter of 2020. We resumed stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2021.\nU.S. federal and state laws impose limitations on the payment of dividends by U.S. depository institutions, such as GS Bank USA. In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by the entity in any calendar year is in excess of the current year’s net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the entity obtains prior regulatory approval. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity’s undivided profits (generally, accumulated net profits that have not been paid out as dividends or transferred to surplus). In addition, as a result of GS Bank USA’s election to exclude holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at the Federal Reserve from its total leverage exposure, in calculating the supplementary leverage ratio, any dividend by GS Bank USA through March 31, 2021 is subject to the prior approval of the FRB.\nThe applicable U.S. banking regulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends if, in the banking regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nGiven the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, significant banks established in the E.U., such as GSBE, are currently subject to an ECB recommendation not to distribute any cash dividends or to limit such distributions through September 2021, and in any event to limit dividends to 15% of their total profits for 2019-2020 and 20 basis points of their CET1 capital ratio, whichever is lower. According to this recommendation, banks that intend to pay dividends or buy back shares need to be profitable and have robust capital.\nSource of Strength.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires BHCs to act as a source of strength to their bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries. This support may be required by the FRB at times when BHCs might otherwise determine not to provide it. Capital loans by a BHC to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In addition, if a BHC commits to a U.S. federal banking agency that it will maintain the capital of its bank subsidiary, whether in response to the FRB’s invoking its\nsource-of-strength\nauthority or in response to other regulatory measures, that commitment will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee for the BHC and the bank will be entitled to priority payment in respect of that commitment, ahead of other creditors of the BHC.\nTransactions between Affiliates.\nTransactions between GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries and Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to restrictions under the Federal Reserve Act and regulations issued by the FRB. These laws and regulations generally limit the types and amounts of transactions (such as loans and other credit extensions, including credit exposure arising from resale agreements, securities borrowing and derivative transactions, from GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries to Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates and purchases of assets by GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries from Group Inc. or its other subsidiaries and affiliates) that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on market terms or better to GS Bank USA or its subsidiaries. These laws and regulations generally do not apply to transactions between GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries. Similarly, PRA rules and German regulatory requirements provide that transactions between GSI, GSIB, GSBE and their respective affiliates, including Group Inc. and GS Bank USA, must be on market terms and are subject to special internal approval requirements.\nThe BHC Act prohibits the FRB from requiring a payment by a BHC subsidiary to a depository institution if the functional regulator of that subsidiary objects to the payment. In that case, the FRB could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture.\nResolution and Recovery.\nWe are required by the FRB and the FDIC to submit a periodic plan for our rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure (resolution plan). If the regulators jointly determine that an institution has failed to remediate identified shortcomings in its resolution plan and that its resolution plan, after any permitted resubmission, is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the regulators may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations, or may jointly order the institution to divest assets or operations, in order to facilitate orderly resolution in the event of failure. We submitted our 2019 resolution plan in June 2019 and the FRB and FDIC did not identify deficiencies or shortcomings. In October 2019, the FRB and FDIC adopted a rule requiring U.S.\nG-SIBs\nto submit resolution plans on a\ntwo-year\ncycle (alternating between full and targeted submissions). Our next required submission is a targeted submission by July 1, 2021. See “Risk Factors — The application of Group Inc.’s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for Group Inc.’s security holders” in Part I, Item 1A of this\nForm 10-K\nand “Available Information” in Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-K\nfor further information about our resolution plan.\nWe are also required by the FRB to submit, on a periodic basis, a global recovery plan that outlines the steps that we could take to reduce risk, maintain sufficient liquidity, and conserve capital in times of prolonged stress.\nThe FDIC has issued a rule requiring each insured depository institution (IDI) with $50 billion or more in assets, such as GS Bank USA, to provide a resolution plan. Our resolution plan for GS Bank USA must, among other things, demonstrate that it is adequately protected from risks arising from our other entities. GS Bank USA’s most recent resolution plan was submitted in June 2018. In April 2019, the FDIC released an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking about potential changes to its resolution planning requirements for IDIs, including GS Bank USA, and delayed the next round of IDI resolution plan submissions until the rulemaking process is complete. Although the rulemaking process is still pending, in January 2021, the FDIC announced its intention to resume requiring resolution plan submissions for IDIs with $100 billion or more in assets, including GS Bank USA.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted rules imposing restrictions on qualified financial contracts (QFCs) entered into by\nG-SIBs,\nwhich became fully effective in January 2020. The rules are intended to facilitate the orderly resolution of a failed\nG-SIB\nby limiting the ability of the\nG-SIB\nto enter into a QFC unless (i) the counterparty waives certain default rights in such contract arising upon the entry of the\nG-SIB\nor one of its affiliates into resolution, (ii) the contract does not contain enumerated prohibitions on the transfer of such contract and/or any related credit enhancement, and (iii) the counterparty agrees that the contract will be subject to the special resolution regimes set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act orderly liquidation authority (OLA) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950 (FDIA), described below. Compliance can be achieved by adhering to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Universal Resolution Stay Protocol (ISDA Universal Protocol) or International Swaps and Derivatives Association 2018 U.S. Resolution Stay Protocol (U.S. ISDA Protocol) described below.\nCertain of our subsidiaries, along with those of a number of other major global banking organizations, adhere to the ISDA Universal Protocol, which was developed and updated in coordination with the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body that sets standards and coordinates the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies. The ISDA Universal Protocol imposes a stay on certain cross-default and early termination rights within standard ISDA derivative contracts and securities financing transactions between adhering parties in the event that one of them is subject to resolution in its home jurisdiction, including a resolution under the OLA or the FDIA in the U.S. In addition, certain Group Inc. subsidiaries adhere to the U.S. ISDA Protocol, which was based on the ISDA Universal Protocol and was created to allow market participants to comply with the final QFC rules adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies.\nThe amended E.U. Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD II) establishes a framework for the recovery and resolution of financial institutions in the E.U., such as GSBE. The BRRD II provides national supervisory authorities with tools and powers to\npre-emptively\naddress potential financial crises in order to promote financial stability and minimize taxpayers’ exposure to losses. The BRRD II requires E.U. member states to grant certain resolution powers to national and, where relevant, E.U. resolution authorities, including the power to impose a temporary stay and to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity. Financial institutions in the E.U. must provide that contracts governed by\nnon-E.U.\nlaw recognize those temporary stay and\nbail-in\npowers unless doing so would be impracticable. Regulatory authorities in the E.U. may require financial institutions in the E.U., including subsidiaries of\nnon-E.U.\ngroups, to submit recovery plans and to assist the relevant resolution authority in constructing resolution plans for the E.U. entities. The U.K. Special Resolution Regime confers substantially the same powers on the Bank of England, as the U.K. resolution authority, and substantially the same requirements on U.K. financial institutions. Further, certain U.K. financial institutions, including GSI and GSIB, have been required by the PRA to submit solvent wind-down plans on how they could be wound down in a stressed environment.\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC).\nThe FRB has issued a rule addressing U.S. implementation of the FSB’s TLAC principles and term sheet on minimum TLAC requirements for\nG-SIBs.\nThe rule (i) establishes minimum TLAC requirements, (ii) establishes minimum “eligible long-term debt” (i.e., debt that is unsecured, has a maturity of at least one year from issuance and satisfies certain additional criteria) requirements, (iii) prohibits certain parent company transactions and (iv) caps the amount of parent company liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt.\nThe rule also prohibits a BHC that has been designated as a U.S.\nG-SIB\nfrom (i) guaranteeing liabilities of subsidiaries that are subject to early termination provisions if the BHC enters into an insolvency or receivership proceeding, subject to an exception for guarantees permitted by rules of the U.S. federal banking agencies imposing restrictions on QFCs; (ii) incurring liabilities guaranteed by subsidiaries; (iii) issuing short-term debt; or (iv) entering into derivatives and certain other financial contracts with external counterparties.\nAdditionally, the rule caps, at 5% of the value of the parent company’s eligible TLAC, the amount of unsecured\nnon-contingent\nthird-party liabilities that are not eligible long-term debt that could rank equally with or junior to eligible long-term debt.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn October 2020, the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC issued a final rule requiring “Advanced approach” banking organizations, such as us, to deduct from their own regulatory capital certain investments above thresholds in unsecured debt instruments issued by\nG-SIBs,\nincluding those issued for purposes of satisfying TLAC requirements. The rule will become effective April 1, 2021.\nThe BRRD II and the U.K. resolution regime subject institutions to a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), which is generally consistent with the FSB’s TLAC standard. In June 2018, the Bank of England published a statement of policy on internal MREL, which requires a material U.K. subsidiary of an overseas banking group, such as GSI, to meet a minimum internal MREL requirement to facilitate the transfer of losses to its resolution entity, which for GSI is Group Inc. The transitional minimum internal MREL requirement began to phase in from January 1, 2019 and will become fully effective on January 1, 2022. In order to comply with the MREL statement of policy,\nbail-in\ntriggers have been provided to the Bank of England over certain intercompany regulatory capital and senior debt instruments issued by GSI. These triggers enable the Bank of England to write down such instruments or convert such instruments to equity. The triggers can be exercised by the Bank of England if it determines that GSI has reached the point of\nnon-viability\nand the FRB and the FDIC have not objected to the\nbail-in\nor if Group Inc. enters bankruptcy or similar proceedings.\nCRR II and the BRRD II are designed to, among other things, implement the FSB’s minimum TLAC requirement for\nG-SIBs.\nFor example, CRR II requires E.U. subsidiaries of a\nnon-E.U.\nG-SIB\nthat account for more than 5% of its RWAs, operating income or leverage exposure, such as GSG UK, to meet 90% of the TLAC requirement applicable to E.U.\nG-SIBs.\nCRD V requires a\nnon-E.U.\ngroup with more than €40 billion of assets in the E.U., such as us, to establish an E.U. intermediate holding company (E.U. IHC) by December 30, 2023 if it has, as in our case, two or more of certain types of E.U. financial institution subsidiaries, including broker-dealers and banks, and an E.U. group can request to have a second E.U. IHC. CRR II requires E.U. IHCs to satisfy capital, liquidity, MREL and certain other prudential requirements at a consolidated level. The U.K. has not implemented the requirement for an E.U. IHC.\nInsolvency of an IDI or a BHC.\nUnder the FDIA, if the FDIC is appointed as conservator or receiver for an IDI such as GS Bank USA, upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has broad powers, including the power:\nIn addition, the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an IDI would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims, including deposits at\nnon-U.S.\nbranches and claims of debtholders of the IDI, in the “liquidation or other resolution” of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of GS Bank USA, the debtholders (other than depositors at U.S. branches) would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the depositors at U.S. branches of GS Bank USA.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a resolution regime (known as OLA) for BHCs and their affiliates that are systemically important. Under OLA, the FDIC may be appointed as receiver for the systemically important institution and its failed\nnon-bank\nsubsidiaries if, upon the recommendation of applicable regulators, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury determines, among other things, that the institution is in default or in danger of default, that the institution’s failure would have serious adverse effects on the U.S. financial system and that resolution under OLA would avoid or mitigate those effects.\nIf the FDIC is appointed as receiver under OLA, then the powers of the receiver, and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have dealt with the institution, would be determined under OLA, and not under the bankruptcy or insolvency law that would otherwise apply. The powers of the receiver under OLA were generally based on the powers of the FDIC as receiver for depository institutions under the FDIA.\nSubstantial differences in the rights of creditors exist between OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors’ claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a “bridge” entity. In addition, OLA limits the ability of creditors to enforce certain contractual cross-defaults against affiliates of the institution in receivership. The FDIC has issued a notice that it would likely resolve a failed FHC by transferring its assets to a “bridge” holding company under its “single point of entry” or “SPOE” strategy pursuant to OLA.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nDeposit Insurance.\nDeposits at GS Bank USA have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on IDIs. GS Bank USA’s assessment (subject to adjustment by the FDIC) is currently based on its average total consolidated assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period, its supervisory ratings and specified forward-looking financial measures used to calculate the assessment rate. In addition, deposits at GSIB are covered by the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme and deposits at GSBE are covered by the German statutory deposit protection scheme and a voluntary\ntop-up\nscheme, in each case up to the applicable limits.\nPrompt Corrective Action.\nThe U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) requires the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks, such as GS Bank USA: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.\nAn institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, as the capital category of an institution declines. Failure to meet the capital requirements could also require a depository institution to raise capital. Ultimately, critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator, as described in “Insolvency of an IDI or a BHC” above.\nThe prompt corrective action regulations do not apply to BHCs. However, the FRB is authorized to take appropriate action at the BHC level, based upon the undercapitalized status of the BHC’s depository institution subsidiaries. In certain instances, relating to an undercapitalized depository institution subsidiary, the BHC would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiary’s capital restoration plan and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the BHC, the guarantee would take priority over the BHC’s general unsecured creditors, as described in “Source of Strength” above.\nVolcker Rule and Other Restrictions on Activities.\nAs a BHC, we are subject to limitations on the types of business activities we may engage in.\nVolcker Rule.\nThe Volcker Rule prohibits “proprietary trading,” but permits activities such as underwriting, market making and risk-mitigation hedging, requires an extensive compliance program and includes additional reporting and record-keeping requirements.\nIn addition, the Volcker Rule limits the sponsorship of, and investment in, “covered funds” (as defined in the rule) by banking entities, including us. It also limits certain types of transactions between us and our sponsored and advised funds, similar to the limitations on transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates. Covered funds include our private equity funds, certain of our credit and real estate funds, our hedge funds and certain other investment structures. The limitation on investments in covered funds requires us to limit our investment in each such fund to 3% or less of the fund’s net asset value, and to limit our aggregate investment in all such funds to 3% or less of our Tier 1 capital.\nThe FRB has extended the conformance period to July 2022 for our investments in, and relationships with, certain legacy “illiquid funds” (as defined in the Volcker Rule) that were in place prior to December 2013. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K\nfor further information about our investments in such funds.\nThe FRB, OCC, FDIC, CFTC and SEC (Volcker Rule regulators) finalized amendments in October 2019 to their regulations implementing the Volcker Rule, tailoring compliance requirements based on the size and scope of a banking entity’s trading activities and clarifying and amending certain definitions, requirements and exemptions. Compliance with these amendments became effective in January 2021. In addition, in June 2020 the Volcker Rule regulators finalized their previously proposed amendments to the Volcker Rule’s regulations relating to covered funds. These amendments established new exclusions from the covered fund definition for certain types of investment vehicles, modified the eligibility criteria for certain existing exclusions, and clarified and modified other provisions governing banking entities’ investments in and other transactions and relationships involving covered funds, including clarifying that investments alongside covered funds are not treated as investments in covered funds subject to the 3% limitation noted above if certain conditions are met. These amendments became effective in October 2020.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOther Restrictions.\nFHCs generally can engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than are otherwise permissible for BHCs as long as they continue to meet the eligibility requirements for FHCs. The broader range of permissible activities for FHCs includes underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities and making investments in\nnon-FHCs\n(merchant banking activities). In addition, certain FHCs, including us, are permitted to engage in certain commodities activities in the U.S. that may otherwise be impermissible for BHCs, so long as the assets held pursuant to these activities do not equal 5% or more of their consolidated assets.\nThe FRB, however, has the authority to limit an FHC’s ability to conduct activities that would otherwise be permissible, and will likely do so if the FHC does not satisfactorily meet certain requirements of the FRB. For example, if an FHC or any of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries ceases to maintain its status as well-capitalized or well-managed, the FRB may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements, as well as additional limitations or conditions. If the deficiencies persist, the FHC may be required to divest its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries or to cease engaging in activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities.\nIf any IDI subsidiary of an FHC fails to maintain at least a “satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment Act, the FHC would be subject to restrictions on certain new activities and acquisitions.\nIn addition, we are required to obtain prior FRB approval before engaging in certain banking and other financial activities both within and outside the U.S.\nThe FRB issued a proposed rule in September 2016 which, if adopted, would impose new requirements on the physical commodity activities and certain merchant banking activities of FHCs, including, among other things, additional capital requirements, stringent quantitative limits on permissible physical trading activity, and new public reporting requirements. In addition, in a September 2016 report, the FRB recommended that Congress repeal authorities for FHCs to engage in merchant banking activities and for certain FHCs to engage in certain otherwise impermissible commodities activities.\nSince January 2020, U.S.\nG-SIBs,\nlike us, have been required to comply with a rule regarding single counterparty credit limits, which imposes more stringent requirements for credit exposures among major financial institutions. In addition, in 2011, the FRB proposed early remediation requirements, which are modeled on the prompt corrective action regime, described in “Prompt Corrective Action” above, but are designed to require action to begin in earlier stages of a company’s financial distress, based on a range of triggers, including capital and leverage, stress test results, liquidity and risk management.\nThe New York State banking law imposes lending limits (which take into account credit exposure from derivative transactions) and other requirements that could impact the manner and scope of GS Bank USA’s activities.\nThe U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have issued guidance that focuses on transaction structures and risk management frameworks and that outlines high-level principles for\nsafe-and-sound\nleveraged lending, including underwriting standards, valuation and stress testing. This guidance has, among other things, limited the percentage amount of debt that can be included in certain transactions.\nAs a German credit institution, GSBE will become subject to Volcker Rule-type prohibitions in Germany on “proprietary trading” as well as lending and guarantee businesses with hedge funds and other highly-leveraged funds once its assets exceed certain thresholds.\nU.K. banks that have over £25 billion of core retail deposits are required to separate their retail banking services from their investment and international banking activities, commonly known as “ring-fencing.” GSIB is not currently subject to the ring-fencing requirement and if it were to become subject to it, GSIB would need to make significant operational and structural changes.\nBroker-Dealer and Securities Regulation\nOur broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping, the financing of clients’ purchases, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. In the U.S., the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. GS&Co. is registered as a broker-dealer, a municipal advisor and an investment adviser with the SEC and as a broker-dealer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. U.S. self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA and the NYSE, adopt rules that apply to, and examine, broker-dealers such as GS&Co.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nU.S. state securities and other U.S. regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over GS&Co. Similarly, our businesses are also subject to regulation by various\nnon-U.S.\ngovernmental and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory authorities in virtually all countries where we have offices, as described further below. For a description of net capital requirements applicable to GS&Co., see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital — U.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries” in Part II, Item 7 of this\nForm 10-K.\nIn Europe, we provide broker-dealer services, including through GSI, GSBE and GSPIC, that are subject to oversight by national regulators. These services are regulated in accordance with U.K., E.U. and national laws and regulations. These laws require, among other things, compliance with certain capital adequacy and liquidity standards, customer protection requirements and market conduct and trade reporting rules. Certain of our European subsidiaries are also regulated by the securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of which they are members.\nGoldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), our regulated Japanese broker-dealer, is subject to capital requirements imposed by Japan’s Financial Services Agency. GSJCL is also regulated by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Osaka Exchange, the Tokyo Financial Exchange, the Japan Securities Dealers Association, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance, among others.\nThe Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Korean Financial Supervisory Service, the Reserve Bank of India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India,\nthe Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Securities Exchange, among others, regulate various of our subsidiaries and also have capital standards and other requirements comparable to the rules of the SEC.\nOur exchange-based market-making activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of securities exchanges. As a market maker on exchanges, we are required to maintain orderly markets in the securities to which we are assigned.\nIn the E.U. and the U.K., MiFID II includes extensive market structure reforms, such as the establishment of new trading venue categories for the purposes of discharging the obligation to trade OTC derivatives on a trading platform and enhanced\npre-\nand post-trade transparency covering a wider range of financial instruments. In equities, MiFID II introduced volume caps on\nnon-transparent\nliquidity trading for trading venues, limited the use of broker-dealer crossing networks and created a new regime for systematic internalizers, which are investment firms that execute client transactions outside a trading venue. Additional control requirements were introduced for algorithmic trading, high frequency trading and direct electronic access. Commodities trading firms are required to calculate their positions and adhere to specific position limits. Other reforms introduced enhanced transaction reporting, the publication of best execution data by investment firms and trading venues, transparency on costs and charges of service to investors, changes to the way investment managers can pay for the receipt of investment research, rules limiting the payment and receipt of soft commissions and other forms of inducements, and mandatory unbundling for broker-dealers between execution and other major services.\nThe SEC requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of their customers, and also issued an interpretation clarifying the SEC’s views of the existing fiduciary duty owed by investment advisers to their clients. Additionally, the SEC adopted a rule that requires broker-dealers and investment advisers to provide a standardized, short-form disclosure highlighting services offered, applicable standards of conduct, fees and costs, the differences between brokerage and advisory services, and any conflicts of interest. Requirements under these rules became effective in June 2020. Several states have adopted or proposed adopting uniform fiduciary duty standards applicable to broker-dealers and advisers.\nThe SEC, FINRA and regulators in various\nnon-U.S.\njurisdictions have imposed both conduct-based and disclosure-based requirements with respect to research reports and research analysts and may impose additional regulations.\nGS&Co., GS Bank USA and other U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to rules adopted by U.S. federal agencies pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that require any person who organizes or initiates certain asset-backed securities transactions to retain a portion (generally, at least five percent) of any credit risk that the person conveys to a third party. For certain securitization transactions, retention by third-party purchasers may satisfy this requirement. Certain of our\nnon-U.S.\nsubsidiaries, including GSI, are subject to risk retention requirements in connection with securitization activities.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSwaps, Derivatives and Commodities Regulation\nThe commodity futures, commodity options and swaps industry in the U.S. is subject to regulation under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The CFTC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the administration of the CEA. In addition, the SEC is the U.S. federal agency charged with the regulation of security-based swaps. The rules and regulations of various self-regulatory organizations, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, other futures exchanges and the National Futures Association, also govern commodity futures, commodity options and swaps activities.\nThe terms “swaps” and “security-based swaps” include a wide variety of derivative instruments in addition to those conventionally referred to as swaps (including certain forward contracts and options), and relate to a wide variety of underlying assets or obligations, including currencies, commodities, interest or other monetary rates, yields, indices, securities, credit events, loans and other financial obligations.\nCFTC rules require registration of swap dealers, mandatory clearing and execution of interest rate and credit default swaps and real-time public reporting and adherence to business conduct standards for all\nin-scope\nswaps. GS&Co. and other subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA, GSI, GSBE and J. Aron & Company LLC (J. Aron), are registered with the CFTC as swap dealers. In July 2020, the CFTC adopted final rules establishing capital requirements for swap dealers that are not subject to the capital rules of a prudential regulator, such as the FRB. The CFTC also adopted financial reporting requirements for covered swap entities and amended existing capital rules for CFTC-registered futures commission merchants to provide explicit capital requirements for proprietary positions in swaps and security-based swaps that are not cleared by a clearing organization. Compliance with the final rules is required by October 6, 2021. Certain of our registered swap dealers, including J. Aron, will be subject to the CFTC’s capital requirements.\nOur affiliates registered as swap dealers are subject to the margin rules issued by the CFTC (in the case of our\nnon-bank\nswap dealers) and the FRB (in the case of GS Bank USA and GSBE). The rules for variation margin have become effective, and those for initial margin will phase in through September 2022 depending on certain activity levels of the swap dealer and the relevant counterparty. Inter-affiliate transactions under the CFTC margin rules are generally exempt from initial margin requirements. In June 2020, the FRB adopted a final rule that exempts inter-affiliate swaps from its initial margin requirements subject to certain thresholds.\nThe CFTC has adopted rules relating to cross-border regulation of swaps, business conduct and registration requirements. The CFTC has entered into agreements with certain\nnon-U.S.\nregulators, including in the E.U., regarding the cross-border regulation of derivatives and the mutual recognition of cross-border clearing houses, and has approved substituted compliance with certain\nnon-U.S.\nregulations, including E.U. regulations, related to certain business conduct requirements and margin rules. The U.S. prudential regulators have not yet made a determination with respect to substituted compliance for transactions subject to\nnon-U.S.\nmargin rules.\nSimilar types of swap regulation have been proposed or adopted in jurisdictions outside the U.S., including in the E.U. and Japan. For example, the E.U. and the U.K. have established regulatory requirements relating to portfolio reconciliation and reporting, clearing certain OTC derivatives and margining for uncleared derivatives activities under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR).\nSEC rules govern the registration and regulation of security-based swap dealers. The SEC adopted a number of rules and rule amendments for security-based swap dealers in 2019, including (i) capital, margin and segregation requirements, (ii) record-keeping, reporting and notification requirements, and (iii) the application of risk mitigation techniques to uncleared portfolios of security-based swaps and the cross-border application of certain security-based swap requirements. The compliance date for these SEC rules, as well as SEC rules addressing registration requirements and business conduct standards, is generally October 2021. We anticipate that certain of our subsidiaries will register with the SEC as security-based swap dealers and become subject to the SEC’s regulations regarding security-based swaps.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe CFTC has adopted position limit rules that will limit the size of positions in physical commodity derivatives that can be held by any entity, or any group of affiliates or other parties trading under common control, subject to certain exemptions, such as for bona fide hedging positions. However, effective in 2023, the new rules will eliminate the risk management exemption, which allowed swap dealers to claim an exemption for the hedging of swap-related risks. The new CFTC position limits will apply to certain positions in swaps, as well as futures and options on futures, on physical commodities, and limits will apply to both physically and cash settled positions. Currently, position limits on futures on physical commodities are administered by the relevant exchanges, with the exception of futures on certain agricultural commodities, which are administered by the CFTC. Under the CFTC’s position limit rules, all futures and options on futures on an enumerated list of physical commodities, including certain agricultural, energy and metals commodities, as well as related swaps, will be subject to the CFTC’s position limits. The new position limit rules impose limits in the spot month only (i.e., during the delivery period for the physical commodities, which is typically a period of several days), although the CFTC may in the future impose limits in\nnon-spot\nmonths as well. CFTC spot and\nnon-spot\nmonth limits will continue to apply to futures on certain legacy agricultural commodities.\nJ. Aron is authorized by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to sell wholesale physical power at market-based rates. As a FERC-authorized power marketer, J. Aron is subject to regulation under the U.S. Federal Power Act and FERC regulations and to the oversight of FERC. As a result of our investing activities, Group Inc. is also an “exempt holding company” under the U.S. Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 and applicable FERC rules.\nIn addition, as a result of our power-related and commodities activities, we are subject to energy, environmental and other governmental laws and regulations, as described in “Risk Factors — Our commodities activities, particularly our physical commodities activities, subject us to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risks, including environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs” in Part I, Item 1A of this\nForm 10-K.\nGS&Co. is registered with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant, and several of our subsidiaries, including GS&Co., are registered with the CFTC and act as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors. Goldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P. is registered with the SEC as an OTC derivatives dealer.\nAsset Management and Wealth Management Regulation\nOur asset management and wealth management businesses are subject to extensive oversight by regulators around the world relating to, among other things, the fair treatment of clients, safeguarding of client assets, offerings of funds, marketing activities, transactions among affiliates and our management of client funds.\nCertain of our European subsidiaries, including GSAMI in the U.K. and GSBE in the E.U., are subject to MiFID II and/or related regulations (including the U.K. legislation making such regulations part of U.K. law), which govern the approval, organizational, marketing and reporting requirements of U.K. or E.U.-based investment managers and the ability of investment fund managers located outside the E.U. or the U.K. to access those markets. Our asset management business in the U.K. and the E.U. significantly depends on our ability to delegate parts of our activities to other affiliates.\nConsumer Regulation\nOur U.S. consumer-oriented activities are subject to extensive oversight by federal and state regulators. These businesses are subject to supervision and regulation by the CFPB with respect to federal consumer protection laws, including laws relating to fair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale or provision of consumer financial products and services. Our consumer-oriented businesses are also subject to various state and local consumer protection laws. These laws, rules and regulations, among other things, impose obligations relating to our marketing, origination, servicing and collections activity in our consumer businesses. Many of these laws, rules and regulations also apply to our small business lending activities which are subject to supervision and regulation by federal and state regulators as well. Our U.K. consumer deposit-taking activities are also subject to consumer protection regulations.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCompensation Practices\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the FRB and, with respect to some of our subsidiaries and employees, by other regulatory bodies worldwide.\nThe FSB has released standards for local regulators to implement certain compensation principles for banks and other financial companies designed to encourage sound compensation practices. The U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies have provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices. The guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements: (i) the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk; (ii) the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and (iii) the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance. The guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated, as appropriate, into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The guidance also notes that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management, control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the U.S. financial regulators, including the FRB and SEC, to adopt rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets. The U.S. financial regulators proposed revised rules in 2016, which have not been finalized.\nThe NYDFS issued guidance in October 2016 emphasizing that its regulated banking institutions, including GS Bank USA, must ensure that any incentive compensation arrangements tied to employee performance indicators are subject to effective risk management, oversight and control.\nIn the E.U., the CRR and CRD IV include compensation provisions designed to implement the FSB’s compensation standards. These rules have been implemented by E.U. member states and in the U.K. and, among other things, limit the ratio of variable to fixed compensation of all employees at GSBE and certain employees at our other operating subsidiaries in the E.U. and in the U.K., including those employees identified as having a material impact on the risk profile of regulated entities. CRR II and CRD V amend certain aspects of these rules, including, among other things, by increasing minimum variable compensation deferral periods. Substantially similar requirements apply in the U.K. in relation to GSI and GSIB.\nThe E.U. has also introduced rules regulating compensation for certain persons providing services to certain investment funds. These requirements are in addition to the guidance issued by U.S. financial regulators and the Dodd-Frank Act provision, each as described above.\nAnti-Money Laundering and Anti-Bribery Rules and Regulations\nThe U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (PATRIOT Act), contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various regulations applicable to all financial institutions, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities. Through these and other provisions, the BSA and the PATRIOT Act seek to promote the identification of parties that may be involved in terrorism, money laundering or other suspicious activities. Anti-money laundering laws outside the U.S. contain some similar provisions.\nIn January 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (AMLA), which amends the BSA, was enacted. The AMLA is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, the AMLA codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the development of standards by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for evaluating technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; and expands enforcement- and investigation-related authority, including a significant expansion in the available sanctions for certain BSA violations and instituting BSA whistleblower incentives and protections. Many of the statutory provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemaking and implementation guidance.\nIn addition, we are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt and illegal payments to, and hiring practices with regard to, government officials and others. The scope of the types of payments or other benefits covered by these laws is very broad and regulators are frequently using enforcement proceedings to define the scope of these laws. The obligation of financial institutions to identify their clients, to monitor for and report suspicious transactions, to monitor direct and indirect payments to politically exposed persons, to respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and to share information with other financial institutions, has required the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nPrivacy and Cyber Security Regulation\nOur businesses are subject to laws and regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments, the E.U., the U.K. or other\nnon-U.S.\njurisdictions and/or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, including the GLB Act, the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the U.K.’s Data Protection Act 2018, the Japanese Personal Information Protection Act, the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, the Australian Privacy Act, the Brazilian Bank Secrecy Law, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). The GDPR has heightened our privacy compliance obligations, impacted certain of our businesses’ collection, processing and retention of personal data and imposed strict standards for reporting data breaches. The GDPR also provides for significant penalties for\nnon-compliance.\nIn addition, the CCPA imposes compliance obligations with regard to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. The substantive obligations under the 2020 amendments to the CCPA become effective on January 1, 2023. In addition, several other states and\nnon-U.S.\njurisdictions have enacted, or are proposing, privacy and data protection laws similar to the GDPR and the CCPA.\nThe NYDFS also requires financial institutions regulated by the NYDFS, including GS Bank USA, to, among other things, (i) establish and maintain a cyber security program designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information systems; (ii) implement and maintain a written cyber security policy setting forth policies and procedures for the protection of their information systems and nonpublic information; and (iii) designate a Chief Information Security Officer.\nIn December 2020, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies released a proposed rule regarding notification requirements for banking organizations related to significant computer security incidents. Under the proposal, a BHC or state member bank, such as Group Inc. or GS Bank USA, would be required to notify the FRB within 36 hours of incidents that could result in the banking organization’s inability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization, or impact the stability of the financial sector.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nSet forth below are the name, age, present title, principal occupation and certain biographical information for the executive officers who have been appointed by, and serve at the pleasure of, Group Inc.’s Board of Directors (Board).\nSheara Fredman, 45\nMs. Fredman has been Controller and Chief Accounting Officer since November 2019.

ROTE, efficiency ratio and expense savings, and how they can be achieved, are based on our current expectations regarding our business prospects and are subject to the risk that we may be unable to achieve our targets due to, among other things, changes in our business mix, lower profitability of new business initiatives, increases in technology and other costs to launch and bring new business initiatives to scale, and increases in liquidity requirements.\nStatements about our target ROE, ROTE and CET1 capital ratio, and how they can be achieved, are based on our current expectations regarding the capital requirements applicable to us and are subject to the risk that our actual capital requirements may be higher than currently anticipated because of, among other factors, changes in the regulatory capital requirements applicable to us resulting from changes in regulations or the interpretation or application of existing regulations or changes in the nature and composition of our activities.\nStatements about the timing, costs, profitability, benefits and other aspects of business and expense savings initiatives, the level and composition of more durable revenues and increases in market share are based on our current expectations regarding our ability to implement these initiatives and actual results may differ, possibly materially, from current expectations due

scale are subject to the risks that the compensation and other costs to operate our businesses, including platform initiatives, may be greater than currently expected.\nStatements about our investment banking transaction backlog are subject to the risk that such transactions may be modified or may not be completed at all and related net revenues may not be realized or may be materially less than

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nStatements about the projected growth of our deposits and other funding, asset liability management and funding strategies and related interest expense savings, and our installment loan and credit card businesses, are subject to the risk that actual growth and savings may differ, possibly materially, from that currently anticipated due to, among other things, changes in interest rates and competition from other similar products.\nStatements about planned 2021 parent vanilla debt issuances and the amount, composition and location of GCLA we expect to hold are subject to the risk that actual issuances and GCLA levels may differ, possibly materially, from that currently expected due to changes in market conditions, business opportunities or our funding and projected liquidity needs.\nStatements about our expected provisions for credit losses (including those related to our\nco-branded\ncredit card relationship with General Motors) are subject to the risk that actual credit losses may differ and our expectations may change, possibly materially, from that currently anticipated due to, among other things, changes to the composition of our loan portfolio and changes in the economic environment in future periods and our forecasts of future economic conditions, as well as changes in our models, policies and other management judgments.\nStatements about our NSFR and SCB are based on our current interpretation and expectations of the relevant rules, and reflect significant assumptions about how our NSFR and SCB are calculated. Our actual SCB will depend on the results of the applicable supervisory stress tests, and the methods used to calculate our NSFR and SCB may differ, possibly materially, from those used to calculate our NSFR and SCB for future disclosures.\nStatements about our future effective income tax rate are subject to the risk that it may differ from the anticipated rate indicated in such statements, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in the tax rates applicable to us, changes in our earnings mix, our profitability and entities in which we generate profits, the assumptions we have made in forecasting our expected tax rate, as well as any corporate tax legislation that may be enacted or any guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.\nStatements about the future state of our liquidity and regulatory capital ratios (including our SCB and\nG-SIB\nsurcharge), and our prospective capital distributions (including dividends and repurchases), are subject to the risk that our actual liquidity, regulatory capital ratios and capital distributions may differ, possibly materially, from what is currently expected due to, among other things, the need to use capital to support clients, increased regulatory requirements and changes to the composition of our balance sheet.\nStatements about the risk exposure related to the asset recovery guarantee provided to the Government of Malaysia are subject to the risk that the actual value of assets and proceeds from assets seized and returned to the Government of Malaysia may be less than currently anticipated. Statements about the application for and pursuit of exemptions and authorizations from regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Department of Labor, in connection with the settlements relating to 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and the progress or the status of remediation activities relating to 1MDB are based on our expectations regarding the prospects for receiving the exemptions and authorizations and the current remediation plans. Accordingly, our ability to receive the exemptions and authorizations and complete the remediation activities may change, possibly materially, from what is currently expected.\nStatements about our objectives in management of our human capital, including our diversity goals, are based on our current expectations and are subject to the risk that we may not achieve these objectives and goals due to, among other things, competition in recruiting and attracting diverse candidates and unsuccessful efforts in retaining diverse employees.\nStatements about our plans for our people to return to our offices are based on our current expectations and that return may be delayed due to, among other factors, future events that are unpredictable, including the course of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, responses of governmental authorities and the availability, use and effectiveness of vaccines."

    "text": "We face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses.\nThe following is a summary of some of the more important factors that could affect our businesses:\nMarket\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nLiquidity\nCredit\nMarket Developments and General Business Environment\nOperational\nLegal and Regulatory\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCompetition\nThe following are detailed descriptions of our Risk Factors summarized above:\nMarket\nOur businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by conditions in the global financial markets and broader economic conditions.\nOur businesses, by their nature, do not produce predictable earnings, and all of our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally, both directly and through their impact on client activity levels and creditworthiness. These conditions can change suddenly and negatively.\nOur financial performance is highly dependent on the environment in which our businesses operate. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, high global gross domestic product growth, regulatory and market conditions that result in transparent, liquid and efficient capital markets, low inflation, business, consumer and investor confidence, stable geopolitical conditions and strong business earnings.\nUnfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by: low levels of or declines in economic growth, business activity or investor, business or consumer confidence; pandemics; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; illiquid markets; increases in inflation, interest rates, exchange rate or basic commodity price volatility or default rates; concerns about sovereign defaults; uncertainty concerning fiscal or monetary policy, government shutdowns, debt ceilings or funding; the extent of and uncertainty about potential increases in tax rates and other regulatory changes; the imposition of tariffs or other limitations on international trade and travel; outbreaks of domestic or international tensions or hostilities, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, cyber security threats or attacks and other forms of disruption to or curtailment of global communication, energy transmission or transportation networks or other geopolitical instability or uncertainty; corporate, political or other scandals that reduce investor confidence in capital markets; extreme weather events or other natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nThe financial services industry and the securities and other financial markets have been materially and adversely affected in the past by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes, by a serious lack of liquidity and by high levels of borrower defaults. In addition, concerns about the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, European sovereign debt risk and its impact on the European banking system, the impact of Brexit, the imposition of tariffs and actions taken by other countries in response, and potential or actual changes in interest rates and other market conditions, have resulted, at times, in significant volatility while negatively impacting the levels of client activity.\nGeneral uncertainty about economic, political and market activities, and the scope, timing and impact of regulatory reform, as well as weak consumer, investor and CEO confidence resulting in large part from such uncertainty, has in the past negatively impacted client activity, which can adversely affect many of our businesses. Periods of low volatility and periods of high volatility combined with a lack of liquidity, have at times had an unfavorable impact on our market-making businesses.\nFinancial institution returns may be negatively impacted by increased funding costs due in part to the lack of perceived government support of such institutions in the event of future financial crises relative to financial institutions in countries in which governmental support is maintained. In addition, liquidity in the financial markets has also been negatively impacted as market participants and market practices and structures continue to adjust to evolving regulatory frameworks.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by declining asset values, particularly where we have net “long” positions, receive fees based on the value of assets managed, or receive or post collateral.\nMany of our businesses have net “long” positions in debt securities, loans, derivatives, mortgages, equities (including private equity and real estate) and most other asset classes. These include positions we take when we act as a principal to facilitate our clients’ activities, including our exchange-based market-making activities, or commit large amounts of capital to maintain positions in interest rate and credit products, as well as through our currencies, commodities, equities and mortgage-related activities. In addition, we invest in similar asset classes. Substantially all of our investing and market-making positions and a portion of our loans are\nmarked-to-market\non a daily basis and declines in asset values directly and immediately impact our earnings, unless we have effectively “hedged” our exposures to those declines.\nIn certain circumstances (particularly in the case of credit products, including leveraged loans, and private equities or other securities that are not freely tradable or lack established and liquid trading markets), it may not be possible or economic to hedge our exposures and to the extent that we do so the hedge may be ineffective or may greatly reduce our ability to profit from increases in the values of the assets. Sudden declines and significant volatility in the prices of assets have in the past and may in the future substantially curtail or eliminate the trading markets for certain assets, which may make it difficult to sell, hedge or value such assets. The inability to sell or effectively hedge assets reduces our ability to limit losses in such positions and the difficulty in valuing assets may negatively affect our capital, liquidity or leverage ratios, increase our funding costs and generally require us to maintain additional capital.\nIn our exchange-based market-making activities, we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderly market, including by purchasing securities in a declining market. In markets where asset values are declining and in volatile markets, this results in losses and an increased need for liquidity.\nWe receive asset-based management fees based on the value of our clients’ portfolios or investment in funds managed by us and, in some cases, we also receive incentive fees based on increases in the value of such investments. Declines in asset values would ordinarily reduce the value of our clients’ portfolios or fund assets, which in turn would ordinarily reduce the fees we earn for managing such assets.\nWe post collateral to support our obligations and receive collateral that supports the obligations of our clients and counterparties. When the value of the assets posted as collateral or the credit ratings of the party posting collateral decline, the party posting the collateral may need to provide additional collateral or, if possible, reduce its trading position. An example of such a situation is a “margin call” in connection with a brokerage account. Therefore, declines in the value of asset classes used as collateral mean that either the cost of funding positions is increased or the size of positions is decreased. If we are the party providing collateral, this can increase our costs and reduce our profitability and if we are the party receiving collateral, this can also reduce our profitability by reducing the level of business done with our clients and counterparties.\nIn addition, volatile or less liquid markets increase the difficulty of valuing assets, which can lead to costly and time-consuming disputes over asset values and the level of required collateral, as well as increased credit risk to the recipient of the collateral due to delays in receiving adequate collateral. In cases where we foreclose on collateral, sudden declines in the value or liquidity of the collateral may, despite credit monitoring, over-collateralization, the ability to call for additional collateral or the ability to force repayment of the underlying obligation, result in significant losses to us, especially where there is a single type of collateral supporting the obligation. In addition, we have been and may in the future be subject to claims that the foreclosure was not permitted under the legal documents, was conducted in an improper manner or caused a client or counterparty to go out of business.\nOur market-making activities have been and may in the future be affected by changes in the levels of market volatility.\nCertain of our market-making activities depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities to our clients, and decreases in volatility have reduced and may in the future reduce these opportunities and the level of client activity associated with them and adversely affect the results of these activities. Increased volatility, while it can increase trading volumes and spreads, also increases risk as measured by\nValue-at-Risk\n(VaR) and may expose us to increased risks in connection with our market-making activities or cause us to reduce our inventory in order to avoid increasing our VaR. Limiting the size of our market-making positions can adversely affect our profitability. In periods when volatility is increasing, but asset values are declining significantly, it may not be possible to sell assets at all or it may only be possible to do so at steep discounts. In those circumstances we may be forced to either take on additional risk or to realize losses in order to decrease our VaR. In addition, increases in volatility increase the level of our RWAs, which increases our capital requirements.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur investment banking, client intermediation, asset management and wealth management businesses have been adversely affected and may in the future be adversely affected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors and CEOs due to declines in economic activity and other unfavorable economic, geopolitical or market conditions.\nOur investment banking business has been and may in the future be adversely affected by market conditions. Poor economic conditions and other uncertain geopolitical conditions may adversely affect and have in the past adversely affected investor and CEO confidence, resulting in significant industry-wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and of financial advisory transactions, which would likely have an adverse effect on our revenues and our profit margins. In particular, because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues is derived from our participation in large transactions, a decline in the number of large transactions has in the past and would in the future adversely affect our investment banking business.\nIn certain circumstances, market uncertainty or general declines in market or economic activity may adversely affect our client intermediation businesses by decreasing levels of overall activity or by decreasing volatility, but at other times market uncertainty and even declining economic activity may result in higher trading volumes or higher spreads or both.\nMarket uncertainty, volatility and adverse economic conditions, as well as declines in asset values, may cause our clients to transfer their assets out of our funds\nor other products or their brokerage accounts and result in reduced net revenues, principally in our asset management and wealth management businesses. Even if clients do not withdraw their funds, they may invest them in products that generate less fee income.\nOur asset management and wealth management businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the poor investment performance of our investment products or a client preference for products other than those which we offer or for products that generate lower fees.\nPoor investment returns in our asset management and wealth management businesses, due to either general market conditions or underperformance (relative to our competitors or to benchmarks) by funds or accounts that we manage or investment products that we design or sell, affects our ability to retain existing assets and to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients. This could affect the management and incentive fees that we earn on assets under supervision (AUS) or the commissions and net spreads that we earn for selling other investment products, such as structured notes or derivatives. To the extent that our clients choose to invest in products that we do not currently offer, we will suffer outflows and a loss of management fees. Further, if, due to changes in investor sentiment or the relative performance of certain asset classes or otherwise, clients continue to invest in products that generate lower fees (e.g., passively managed or fixed income products), our average effective management fee would continue to decline and our asset management and wealth management businesses could be adversely affected.\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity, profitability and businesses may be adversely affected by an inability to access the debt capital markets or to sell assets.\nLiquidity is essential to our businesses. It is of critical importance to us, as most of the failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity. Our liquidity may be impaired by an inability to access secured and/or unsecured debt markets, an inability to raise deposits, an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries or otherwise allocate liquidity optimally, an inability to sell assets or redeem our investments, lack of timely settlement of transactions, unusual deposit outflows, or other unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, such as in March 2020, when corporate clients drew on revolving credit facilities in response to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market or economic disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us, or even by the perception among market participants that we, or other market participants, are experiencing greater liquidity risk.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe employ structured products to benefit our clients and hedge our own risks. The financial instruments that we hold and the contracts to which we are a party are often complex, and these complex structured products often do not have readily available markets to access in times of liquidity stress. Our investing and financing activities may lead to situations where the holdings from these activities represent a significant portion of specific markets, which could restrict liquidity for our positions.\nFurther, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if there is not generally a liquid market for such assets, as well as in circumstances where other market participants are seeking to sell similar otherwise generally liquid assets at the same time, as is likely to occur in a liquidity or other market crisis or in response to changes to rules or regulations. In addition, financial institutions with which we interact may exercise\nset-off\nrights or the right to require additional collateral, including in difficult market conditions, which could further impair our liquidity.\nRegulatory changes relating to liquidity may also negatively impact our results of operations and competitive position. Numerous regulations have been adopted to introduce more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions. These regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing, minimum liquidity requirements, wholesale funding, limitations on the issuance of short-term debt and structured notes, deductions for holdings of TLAC and prohibitions on parent guarantees that are subject to certain cross-defaults. New and prospective liquidity-related regulations may overlap with, and be impacted by, other regulatory changes, including rules relating to minimum long-term debt requirements and TLAC, guidance on the treatment of brokered deposits and the capital, leverage and resolution and recovery frameworks applicable to large financial institutions. Given the overlap and complex interactions among these new and prospective regulations, they may have unintended cumulative effects, and their full impact will remain uncertain, while regulatory reforms are being adopted and market practices develop.\nOur businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets, including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit.\nWidening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in the availability of credit, have in the past adversely affected our ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may do so in the future. We fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by issuing long-term debt and commercial paper, by raising deposits at our bank subsidiaries, by issuing hybrid financial instruments and by obtaining loans or lines of credit from commercial or other banking entities. We seek to finance many of our assets on a secured basis. Any disruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses. If our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of funding, both of which could reduce our profitability, particularly in our businesses that involve investing, lending and market making.\nOur clients engaging in mergers, acquisitions and other types of strategic transactions often rely on access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance their transactions. A lack of available credit or an increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size, volume and timing of our clients’ merger and acquisition transactions, particularly large transactions, and adversely affect our financial advisory and underwriting businesses.\nOur credit businesses have been and may in the future be negatively affected by a lack of liquidity in credit markets. A lack of liquidity reduces price transparency, increases price volatility and decreases transaction volumes and size, all of which can increase transaction risk or decrease the profitability of these businesses.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and cost of funding.\nOur credit ratings are important to our liquidity. A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts. Under these provisions, counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with us or require us to post additional collateral. Termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements.\nAs of December 2020, our counterparties could have called for additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements in an aggregate amount of $481 million in the event of a\none-notch\ndowngrade of our credit ratings and $1.39 billion in the event of a\ntwo-notch\ndowngrade of our credit ratings. A downgrade by any one rating agency, depending on the agency’s relative ratings of us at the time of the downgrade, may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies. For further information about our credit ratings, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management — Liquidity Risk Management — Credit Ratings” in Part II, Item 7 of this\nForm 10-K.\nOur cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads (the amount in excess of the interest rate of benchmark securities that we need to pay). Increases in our credit spreads can significantly increase our cost of this funding. Changes in credit spreads are continuous, market-driven, and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile movements. Our credit spreads are also influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness and movements in the costs to purchasers of credit default swaps referenced to our long-term debt. The market for credit default swaps has proven to be extremely volatile and at times has lacked a high degree of transparency or liquidity.\nGroup Inc. is a holding company and its liquidity depends on payments from its subsidiaries, many of which are subject to legal, regulatory and other restrictions on providing funds or assets to Group Inc.\nGroup Inc. is a holding company and, therefore, depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund share repurchases and dividend payments and to fund payments on its obligations, including debt obligations. Many of our subsidiaries, including our broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, are subject to laws that restrict dividend payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc.\nIn addition, our broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements, as well as restrictions on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses. Additional restrictions on related-party transactions, increased capital and liquidity requirements and additional limitations on the use of funds on deposit in bank or brokerage accounts, as well as lower earnings, can reduce the amount of funds available to meet the obligations of Group Inc., including under the FRB’s source of strength requirement, and even require Group Inc. to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries. Restrictions or regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations, including debt obligations, or dividend payments. In addition, Group Inc.’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors.\nThere has been a trend towards increased regulation and supervision of our subsidiaries by the governments and regulators in the countries in which those subsidiaries are located or do business. Concerns about protecting clients and creditors of financial institutions that are controlled by persons or entities located outside of the country in which such entities are located or do business have caused or may cause a number of governments and regulators to take additional steps to “ring fence” or require internal total loss-absorbing capacity (which may also be subject to\n“bail-in”\npowers, as described below) at those entities in order to protect clients and creditors of those entities in the event of financial difficulties involving those entities. The result has been and may continue to be additional limitations on our ability to efficiently move capital and liquidity among our affiliated entities, or to Group Inc., including in times of liquidity stress, thereby increasing the overall level of capital and liquidity required by us on a consolidated basis.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nFurthermore, Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of certain of its subsidiaries, including GS&Co. and GS Bank USA, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, Group Inc. guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a\ntransaction-by-transaction\nbasis, as negotiated with counterparties. These guarantees may require Group Inc. to provide substantial funds or assets to its subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when Group Inc. is in need of liquidity to fund its own obligations.\nThe requirements for us and GS Bank USA to develop and submit recovery and resolution plans to regulators, and the incorporation of feedback received from regulators, may require us to increase capital or liquidity levels or issue additional long-term debt at Group Inc. or particular subsidiaries or otherwise incur additional or duplicative operational or other costs at multiple entities, and may reduce our ability to provide Group Inc. guarantees of the obligations of our subsidiaries or raise debt at Group Inc. Resolution planning may also impair our ability to structure our intercompany and external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient. Furthermore, arrangements to facilitate our resolution planning may cause us to be subject to additional taxes. Any such limitations or requirements would be in addition to the legal and regulatory restrictions described above on our ability to engage in capital actions or make intercompany dividends or payments.\nSee “Business — Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-K\nfor further information about regulatory restrictions.\nCredit\nOur businesses, profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of or defaults by third parties.\nWe are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. A failure of a significant market participant, or even concerns about a default by such an institution, could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect us.\nWe are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. In addition, deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold, including a deterioration in the value of collateral posted by third parties to secure their obligations to us under derivative contracts and loan agreements, could result in losses and/or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes.\nA significant downgrade in the credit ratings of our counterparties could also have a negative impact on our results. While in many cases we are permitted to require additional collateral from counterparties that experience financial difficulty, disputes may arise as to the amount of collateral we are entitled to receive and the value of pledged assets. The termination of contracts and the foreclosure on collateral may subject us to claims for the improper exercise of our rights. Default rates, downgrades and disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral typically increase significantly in times of market stress, increased volatility and illiquidity.\nAs part of our clearing and prime brokerage activities, we finance our clients’ positions, and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients. Although we have limits and regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee.\nConcentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market-making, underwriting, investing and financing activities.\nConcentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market-making, underwriting, investing and financing activities. The number and size of these transactions has affected and may in the future affect our results of operations in a given period. Moreover, because of concentrated risk, we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for our competitors. Disruptions in the credit markets can make it difficult to hedge these credit exposures effectively or economically. In addition, we extend large commitments as part of our credit origination activities.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act, and similar rules adopted in other jurisdictions, require issuers of certain asset-backed securities and any person who organizes and initiates certain asset-backed securities transactions to retain economic exposure to the asset, which has affected the cost of and structures used in connection with these securitization activities. Our inability to reduce our credit risk by selling, syndicating or securitizing these positions, including during periods of market stress, could negatively affect our results of operations due to a decrease in the fair value of the positions, including due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of the borrower, as well as the loss of revenues associated with selling such securities or loans.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty, borrower, issuer (including sovereign issuers) or geographic area or group of related countries, such as the E.U., and a failure or downgrade of, or default by, such entity could negatively impact our businesses, perhaps materially, and the systems by which we set limits and monitor the level of our credit exposure to individual entities, industries, countries and regions may not function as we have anticipated. Regulatory reform, including the Dodd-Frank Act, has led to increased centralization of trading activity through particular clearing houses, central agents or exchanges, which has significantly increased our concentration of risk with respect to these entities. While our activities expose us to many different industries, counterparties and countries, we routinely execute a high volume of transactions with counterparties engaged in financial services activities, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, clearing houses, exchanges and investment funds. This has resulted in significant credit concentration with respect to these counterparties.\nDerivative transactions and delayed documentation or settlements may expose us to credit risk, unexpected risks and potential losses.\nWe are party to a large number of derivative transactions, including credit derivatives. Many of these derivative instruments are individually negotiated and\nnon-standardized,\nwhich can make exiting, transferring or settling positions difficult. Many credit derivatives require that we deliver to the counterparty the underlying security, loan or other obligation in order to receive payment. In a number of cases, we do not hold the underlying security, loan or other obligation and may not be able to obtain the underlying security, loan or other obligation. This could cause us to forfeit the payments due to us under these contracts or result in settlement delays with the attendant credit and operational risk, as well as increased costs to us.\nDerivative transactions may also involve the risk that documentation has not been properly executed, that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the counterparty, or that obligations under such agreements may not be able to be “netted” against other obligations with such counterparty. In addition, counterparties may claim that such transactions were not appropriate or authorized.\nAs a signatory to the ISDA Universal Protocol or U.S. ISDA Protocol (ISDA Protocols) and being subject to the FRB’s and FDIC’s rules on QFCs and similar rules in other jurisdictions, we may not be able to exercise remedies against counterparties and, as this new regime has not yet been tested, we may suffer risks or losses that we would not have expected to suffer if we could immediately close out transactions upon a termination event. Various\nnon-U.S.\nregulators have adopted or proposed regulations contemplated by the ISDA Universal Protocol, and those implementing regulations may result in additional limitations on our ability to exercise remedies against counterparties. The ISDA Protocols and these rules and regulations extend to repurchase agreements and other instruments that are not derivative contracts, and their impact will depend on the development of market practices and structures.\nDerivative contracts and other transactions, including secondary bank loan purchases and sales, entered into with third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties or settled on a timely basis. While the transaction remains unconfirmed or during any delay in settlement, we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default may find it more difficult to enforce our rights.\nIn addition, as new complex derivative products are created, covering a wider array of underlying credit and other instruments, disputes about the terms of the underlying contracts could arise, which could impair our ability to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and subject us to increased costs. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring central clearing of credit derivatives and other OTC derivatives, or a market shift toward standardized derivatives, could reduce the risk associated with these transactions, but under certain circumstances could also limit our ability to develop derivatives that best suit the needs of our clients and to hedge our own risks, and could adversely affect our profitability and has increased our credit exposure to central clearing platforms.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the\nCOVID-19\npandemic.\nThe\nCOVID-19\npandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The extent to which the\nCOVID-19\npandemic will negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations will depend on future developments, including the widespread availability, use and effectiveness of vaccines, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nWhile financial markets have rebounded from the significant declines that occurred earlier in the pandemic and global economic conditions showed signs of improvement during the second half of 2020, many of the circumstances that arose or became more pronounced after the onset of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic persisted at the end of the year, including (i) muted levels of business activity across many sectors of the economy, relatively weak consumer confidence and high unemployment; (ii) elevated levels of market volatility; (iii) the federal funds rate and yields on U.S. Treasury securities near zero; (iv) substantial uncertainty about whether previously announced merger and acquisition deals will be completed or restructured; (v) heightened credit risk with regard to industries that have been most severely impacted by the pandemic, including oil and gas, gaming and lodging, and airlines; (vi) greater emphasis by investors on liquidity products, which generate lower fees, relative to risk assets, resulting in these products comprising a higher share of AUS as compared to the\npre-pandemic\ncomposition; and (vii) higher cyber security, information security and operational risks as a result of work-from-home arrangements.\nDepending on the duration and severity of the pandemic going forward, as well as the effects of the pandemic on consumer and corporate confidence, the conditions noted above could continue for an extended period and other adverse developments may occur or reoccur, including (i) a repeat, or worse, of the decline in the valuation of equity, fixed-income and commodity markets that occurred at the outset of the pandemic; (ii) further declines in U.S. interest rates, to zero or below; (iii) market dislocations that may make hedging strategies less effective or ineffective; (iv) a reduction in fees on AUS due to declines in the valuation of assets or a protracted trend toward asset classes that generate lower fees; (v) disruption in the new issuance markets for debt and equity, leading to a decline in activity; (vi) a deterioration in the liquidity profile of corporate borrowers, resulting in additional draws on credit lines; (vii) defaults by consumers or corporate clients on loans; and (viii) greater challenges in valuing derivative positions and associated collateral, leading to significant increases in collateral calls and valuation disputes.\nThe effects of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic on economic and market conditions have in the past and may in the future also increase demands on our liquidity as we meet client needs. Likewise, these adverse developments have in the past and may in the future affect our capital and leverage ratios. We suspended repurchases of our common stock during the first quarter of 2020 and, consistent with the FRB’s requirement for all large BHCs, extended this suspension through the fourth quarter of 2020 enabling us to deploy more capital and liquidity to meet the needs of our clients. The effects of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic and FRB requirements have limited and in the future may further limit capital distributions.\nGovernmental authorities worldwide have taken increased measures to stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The continued success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to address future market dislocations or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity. We also face an increased risk of client disputes, litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic on economic and market conditions.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe length of the pandemic and the efficacy of the extraordinary measures that have been put in place to address it are unknown. Until the pandemic subsides, we may experience draws on lines of credit, reduced activity levels in investment banking, reduced revenues in our asset management and wealth management businesses and increased client defaults, including defaults in unsecured loans. Even after the pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy, as well as most other major economies, may continue to experience a recession, and we anticipate our businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the U.S. and other major markets.\nOur strategy with respect to Brexit may not be effective.\nOn January 31, 2020, the U.K. left the E.U., and, on December 31, 2020, the transition period under the withdrawal agreement between the U.K. and the E.U. ended. As discussed in “Business — Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-K,\nwe have experienced considerable change in the regulatory framework that governs transactions and business undertaken by our U.K. subsidiaries in the E.U. The U.K. has adopted E.U. financial services legislation that was in effect on December 31, 2020, which means that the U.K. financial services regime will remain substantially the same as under E.U. financial services legislation. However, in the future the U.K. may diverge from E.U. legislation and may decide not to adopt rules that correspond to E.U. legislation not already operative in the U.K. As a result, we face numerous risks that could adversely affect how we conduct our businesses or our profitability and liquidity.\nCertain of our principal subsidiaries, including GSI, GSIB and GSAMI, are incorporated and headquartered in the U.K. During the transition period, they benefitted from\nnon-discriminatory\naccess to E.U. clients and infrastructure based on E.U. treaties and E.U. legislation, including arrangements for cross-border “passporting” and the establishment of E.U. branches. Effective December 31, 2020, and notwithstanding the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the E.U. and U.K. reached at the end of 2020, firms established in the U.K., including our U.K. subsidiaries, have lost their\npan-E.U.\n“passports” and are generally treated as any other entities in countries outside the E.U. whose access to the E.U. is governed by E.U. and national law.\nAs necessary, our German bank subsidiary, GSBE, will act as our main operating subsidiary in the E.U. and has assumed certain functions that can no longer be efficiently and effectively performed by our U.K. operating subsidiaries, including GSI, GSIB and GSAMI. Implementing this strategy could materially adversely affect the manner in which we operate certain businesses in Europe, require us to restructure certain of our operations and expose us to higher operational, regulatory and compliance costs, higher subsidiary-level capital and liquidity requirements, additional restrictions on intercompany transactions, and new restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to share personal data, including client data, all of which could adversely affect our liquidity and profitability. In addition, as we increase our operations in jurisdictions with higher tax rates, our tax rate will increase.\nWe have strengthened the capabilities of our operating subsidiaries in E.U. countries and other member states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area, particularly GSBE, and have moved certain activities there. Although we have invested significant resources to plan for and address Brexit, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategy. In addition, even if we are able to successfully execute our strategy, we face the risk that Brexit could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our E.U operations compared to some of our competitors who have more extensive\npre-existing\noperations in the E.U. outside of the U.K.\nCertain of our businesses, our funding instruments and financial products may be adversely affected by changes in or the discontinuance of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), in particular LIBOR.\nThe administrator of LIBOR has proposed to extend publication of the most commonly used U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings to June 30, 2023 and to cease publishing other LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021. The U.S. federal banking agencies have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using the U.S. Dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. It is not possible to know whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may have on the financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. Similar developments have occurred with respect to other IBORs.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nUncertainty regarding IBORs and the taking of discretionary actions or negotiation of fallback provisions could result in pricing volatility, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, compliance, legal and operational costs and risks associated with client disclosures, as well as systems disruption, model disruption and other business continuity issues. In addition, uncertainty relating to IBORs could result in increased capital requirements for us given potential low transaction volumes, a lack of liquidity or limited observability for exposures linked to IBORs or any emerging successor rates and operational incidents associated with changes in and the discontinuance of IBORs.\nThe language in our contracts and financial instruments that define IBORs, in particular LIBOR, have developed over time and have various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected. If a trigger is satisfied, contracts and financial instruments often give the calculation agent (which may be us) discretion over the successor rate or benchmark to be selected. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty as to how the financial services industry will address the discontinuance of designated rates in contracts and financial instruments or such designated rates ceasing to be acceptable reference rates. This uncertainty could ultimately result in client disputes and litigation surrounding the proper interpretation of our IBOR-based contracts and financial instruments. Although we have adhered to the ISDA IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, the protocol is applicable to derivatives when both parties adhere to the protocol or otherwise agree for it to apply to their derivatives.\nFurther, the discontinuation of an IBOR, changes in an IBOR or changes in market acceptance of any IBOR as a reference rate may also adversely affect the yield on loans or securities held by us, amounts paid on securities we have issued, amounts received and paid on derivative instruments we have entered into, the value of such loans, securities or derivative instruments, the trading market for securities, the terms of new loans being made using different or modified reference rates, our ability to effectively use derivative instruments to manage risk, or the availability or cost of our floating-rate funding and our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.\nCertain of our businesses and our funding instruments may be adversely affected by changes in other reference rates, currencies, indexes, baskets or ETFs to which products we offer or funding that we raise are linked.\nMany of the products that we own or that we offer, such as structured notes, warrants, swaps or security-based swaps, pay interest or determine the principal amount to be paid at maturity or in the event of default by reference to rates or by reference to an index, currency, basket, ETF or other financial metric (the underlier). In the event that the composition of the underlier is significantly changed, by reference to rules governing such underlier or otherwise, the underlier ceases to exist (for example, in the event that a country withdraws from the Euro or links its currency to or delinks its currency from another currency or benchmark, an index or ETF sponsor materially alters the composition of an index or ETF, or stocks in a basket are delisted or become impermissible to be included in the index or ETF) or the underlier ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market benchmark, we may experience adverse effects consistent with those described above for IBORs.\nWe face enhanced risks as new business initiatives and acquisitions lead us to engage in new activities, operate in new locations, transact with a broader array of clients and counterparties and expose us to new asset classes and new markets.\nA number of our recent and planned business initiatives and expansions of existing businesses, including through acquisitions and partnership arrangements, may bring us into contact, directly or indirectly, with individuals and entities that are not within our traditional client and counterparty base, expose us to new asset classes and new markets, and present us with integration challenges. For example, we continue to transact business and invest in new regions, including a wide range of emerging and growth markets, and we expect this trend to continue. Various emerging and growth market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies, defaults or threatened defaults on sovereign debt, capital and currency exchange controls, and low or negative growth rates in their economies. The possible effects of any of these conditions include an adverse impact on our businesses and increased volatility in financial markets generally.\nFurthermore, in a number of our businesses, including where we make markets, invest and lend, we own interests in, or otherwise become affiliated with the ownership and operation of, public services, such as airports, toll roads and shipping ports, as well as physical commodities and commodities infrastructure components, both within and outside the U.S.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe have increased and intend to further increase our consumer-oriented deposit-taking and lending activities. For example, during 2019, we started to issue credit cards to consumers. To the extent we engage in those and other consumer-oriented activities, we have faced, and would continue to face, additional compliance, legal and regulatory risk, increased reputational risk and increased operational risk due to, among other things, higher transaction volumes and significantly increased retention and transmission of consumer and client information. We are also subject to additional legal requirements, including with respect to suitability and consumer protection (for example, Regulation Best Interest, fair lending laws and regulations and privacy laws and regulations). Further, identity fraud may increase and credit reporting practices may change in a manner that makes it more difficult for financial institutions, such as us, to evaluate the creditworthiness of consumers.\nWe have increased and intend to further increase our transaction banking activities. As a result, we expect to face additional compliance, legal and regulatory risk, including with respect to know-your-customer, anti-money laundering and reporting requirements and prohibitions on transfers of property belonging to countries, entities and individuals subject to sanctions by U.S. or other governmental authorities.\nNew business initiatives expose us to new and enhanced risks, including risks associated with dealing with governmental entities, reputational concerns arising from dealing with different types of clients, business partners, counterparties and investors, greater regulatory scrutiny of these activities, increased credit-related, market, sovereign and operational risks, risks arising from accidents or acts of terrorism, and reputational concerns with the manner in which certain assets are being operated or held or in which we interact with these clients, business partners, counterparties and investors. Legal, regulatory and reputational risks may also exist in connection with activities and transactions involving new products or markets where there is regulatory uncertainty or where there are different or conflicting regulations depending on the regulator or the jurisdiction involved, particularly where transactions in such products may involve multiple jurisdictions.\nWe have developed and pursued new business and strategic initiatives, and expect to continue to do so. If and to the extent we are unable to successfully execute those initiatives, we may incur unanticipated costs and losses, and face other adverse consequences, such as negative reputational effects. In addition, the actual effects of pursuing those initiatives may differ, possibly materially, from the benefits that we expect to realize from them, such as generating additional revenues, achieving expense savings, reducing operational risk exposures or using capital and funding more efficiently. Engaging in new activities exposes us to a variety of risks, including that we may be unable to successfully develop new, competitive, efficient and effective systems and processes, and hire and retain the necessary personnel. Due to our lack of historical experience with unsecured retail lending, our loan loss assumptions may prove to be incorrect and we may incur losses significantly above those which we originally anticipated in entering the business.\nIn recent years, we have invested, and may continue to invest, more in businesses that we expect will generate a higher level of more consistent revenues. In order to develop and be able to offer consumer financial products that compete effectively, we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in technology and human capital resources in connection with our consumer-oriented activities. Such investments may not be successful or have returns similar to our other businesses.\nOperational\nA failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, as well as human error, malfeasance or other misconduct, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\nOur businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex and occur at high volumes and frequencies, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. These transactions, as well as the information technology services we provide to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMany rules and regulations worldwide govern our obligations to execute transactions and report such transactions and other information to regulators, exchanges and investors. Compliance with these legal and reporting requirements can be challenging, and we have been and may in the future be subject to regulatory fines and penalties for failing to follow these rules or to report timely, accurate and complete information in accordance with these rules. As such requirements expand, compliance with these rules and regulations has become more challenging.\nAs our client base, including through our consumer businesses, and our geographical reach expand and the volume, speed, frequency and complexity of transactions, especially electronic transactions (as well as the requirements to report such transactions on a real-time basis to clients, regulators and exchanges) increase, developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure becomes more challenging, and the risk of systems or human error in connection with such transactions increases, as well as the potential consequences of such errors due to the speed and volume of transactions involved and the potential difficulty associated with discovering errors quickly enough to limit the resulting consequences. Such risks are exacerbated in times of increased volatility. As with other similarly situated institutions, we utilize credit underwriting models in connection with our businesses, including our consumer-oriented activities. Allegations, whether or not accurate, that the ultimate underwriting decisions do not treat consumers or clients fairly, or comply with the applicable law or regulation, can result in negative publicity, reputational damage and governmental and regulatory scrutiny.\nOur financial, accounting, data processing or other operational systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a spike in transaction volume, adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services. We must continuously update these systems to support our operations and growth and to respond to changes in regulations and markets, and invest heavily in systemic controls and training to pursue our objective of ensuring that such transactions do not violate applicable rules and regulations or, due to errors in processing such transactions, adversely affect markets, our clients and counterparties or us. Enhancements and updates to systems, as well as the requisite training, including in connection with the integration of new businesses, entail significant costs and create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones.\nThe use of computing devices and phones is critical to the work done by our employees and the operation of our systems and businesses and those of our clients and our third-party service providers and vendors. Their importance has continued to increase, in particular in light of work-from-home arrangements implemented in response to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic. Computers and computer networks are subject to various risks, including, among others, cyber attacks, inherent technological defects, system failures and human error. For example, fundamental security flaws in computer chips found in many types of these computing devices and phones have been reported in the past and may be discovered in the future. Cloud technologies are also critical to the operation of our systems and platforms and our reliance on cloud technologies is growing. Service disruptions may lead to delays in accessing, or the loss of, data that is important to our businesses and may hinder our clients’ access to our platforms. Addressing these and similar issues could be costly and affect the performance of these businesses and systems. Operational risks may be incurred in applying fixes and there may still be residual security risks.\nAdditionally, although the prevalence and scope of applications of distributed ledger technology and similar technologies is growing, the technology is also nascent and may be vulnerable to cyber attacks or have other inherent weaknesses. We may be, or may become, exposed to risks related to distributed ledger technology, including through our facilitation of clients’ activities involving financial products linked to distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain or cryptocurrencies, our investments in companies that seek to develop platforms based on distributed ledger technology, and the use of distributed ledger technology by third-party vendors, clients, counterparties, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries.\nNotwithstanding the proliferation of technology and technology-based risk and control systems, our businesses ultimately rely on people as our greatest resource, and, from time to time, they make mistakes or engage in violations of applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures that are not always caught immediately by our technological processes or by our controls and other procedures, which are intended to prevent and detect such errors or violations. These can include calculation errors, mistakes in addressing emails, errors in software or model development or implementation, or simple errors in judgment, as well as intentional efforts to ignore or circumvent applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures. Human errors, malfeasance and other misconduct, including the intentional misuse of client information in connection with insider trading or for other purposes, even if promptly discovered and remediated, can result in reputational damage and material losses and liabilities for us.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn addition, we face the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay, termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities and derivatives transactions, and as our interconnectivity with our clients grows, we increasingly face the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay with respect to our clients’ systems.\nThere has been significant consolidation among clearing agents, exchanges and clearing houses and an increasing number of derivative transactions are cleared on exchanges, which has increased our exposure to operational failure or significant operational delay, termination or capacity constraints of the particular financial intermediaries that we use and could affect our ability to find adequate and cost-effective alternatives in the event of any such failure, delay, termination or constraint. Industry consolidation, whether among market participants or financial intermediaries, increases the risk of operational failure or significant operational delay as disparate complex systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis.\nThe interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses, and the increased centrality of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business. Interconnectivity of financial institutions with other companies through, among other things, application programming interfaces or APIs presents similar risks. Any such failure, termination or constraint could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our businesses or result in financial loss or liability to our clients, impairment of our liquidity, disruption of our businesses, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.\nDespite our resiliency plans and facilities, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities where we are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, satellite, undersea cable or other communications, internet, transportation or other facilities used by us, our employees or third parties with which we conduct business, including cloud service providers. These disruptions may occur as a result of events that affect only our buildings or systems or those of such third parties, or as a result of events with a broader impact globally, regionally or in the cities where those buildings or systems are located, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, war, civil unrest, terrorism, economic or political developments, pandemics and weather events.\nIn addition, although we seek to diversify our third-party vendors to increase our resiliency, we are also exposed to the risk that a disruption or other information technology event at a common service provider to our vendors could impede their ability to provide products or services to us, including in connection with our new business initiatives. We may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to our vendors’ use of common service providers.\nAside from work-from-home arrangements during the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, nearly all of our employees in our primary locations, including the New York metropolitan area, London, Bengaluru, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Salt Lake City, work in close proximity to one another, in one or more buildings. Notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business continuity, given that our headquarters and the largest concentration of our employees are in the New York metropolitan area, and our two principal office buildings in the New York area both are located on the waterfront of the Hudson River, depending on the intensity and longevity of the event, a catastrophic event impacting our New York metropolitan area offices, including a terrorist attack, extreme weather event or other hostile or catastrophic event, could negatively affect our business. If a disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that location are unable to occupy our offices or communicate with or travel to other locations or successfully work remotely, our ability to service and interact with our clients may suffer, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication, work-from-home arrangements or travel.\nA failure to protect our computer systems, networks and information, and our clients’ information, against cyber attacks and similar threats could impair our ability to conduct our businesses, result in the disclosure, theft or destruction of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause losses.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our vendors. There have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services companies, consumer-based companies, governmental agencies and other organizations reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client, customer or other confidential information in recent years, as well as cyber attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by foreign governments. There have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested “ransom” payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to information or systems.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber attacks, including\ndenial-of-service\nattacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect the integrity and functionality of our technology infrastructure and access to and the security of our data. We may face an increasing number of attempted cyber attacks as we expand our mobile- and other internet-based products and services, as well as our usage of mobile and cloud technologies, and as we provide more of these services to a greater number of individual consumers. The increasing migration of our communication from devices we provide to employee-owned devices presents additional risks of cyber attacks, as do work-from-home arrangements such as those implemented in response to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic. In addition, due to our interconnectivity with third-party vendors (and their respective service providers), central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions, we could be adversely impacted if any of them is subject to a successful cyber attack or other information security event. These impacts could include the loss of access to information or services from the third party subject to the cyber attack or other information security event, which could, in turn, interrupt certain of our businesses.\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and information, we may not be able to anticipate, detect or implement effective preventive measures against all cyber threats, especially because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched. Cyber attacks can originate from a variety of sources, including third parties who are affiliated with or sponsored by foreign governments or are involved with organized crime or terrorist organizations. Third parties may also attempt to place individuals in our offices or induce employees, clients or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information or provide access to our data or that of our clients, and these types of risks may be difficult to detect or prevent.\nAlthough we take protective measures proactively and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks on our vendors and other events that could have a security impact. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our systems, the process of enhancing our protective measures can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, protective measures that we employ to compartmentalize our data may reduce our visibility into, and adversely affect our ability to respond to, cyber threats and issues with our systems.\nIf one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients’ or counterparties’ confidential and other information processed, stored in, or transmitted through our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or those of our clients, counterparties or third parties, which could impact their ability to transact with us or otherwise result in legal or regulatory action, significant losses or reputational damage. In addition, such an event could persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and, following detection, it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent, amount and type of information compromised. During the course of an investigation, we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it, and actions, decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business, results of operations and reputation.\nWe have expended, and expect to continue to expend, significant resources on an ongoing basis to modify our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, but these measures may be ineffective and we may be subject to legal or regulatory action, as well as financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.\nOur clients’ confidential information may also be at risk from the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company. Losses due to unauthorized account activity could harm our reputation and may have adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe increased use of mobile and cloud technologies can heighten these and other operational risks, as can work-from-home arrangements. Certain aspects of the security of such technologies are unpredictable or beyond our control, and the failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber attacks could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential and other information. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures, despite their sophistication, may be defeated, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies vastly increase the speed and computing power available.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. We have discussed and worked with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber attacks, but we do not have, and may be unable to put in place, secure capabilities with all of our clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a client, vendor, service provider, counterparty or other third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational harm.\nWe may incur losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. Our risk management process seeks to balance our ability to profit from market-making, investing or lending positions, and underwriting activities, with our exposure to potential losses. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Thus, in the course of our activities, we have incurred and may in the future incur losses. Market conditions in recent years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk.\nThe models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures reflect assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack thereof among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely previously correlated indicators may move in different directions. These types of market movements have at times limited the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and have caused us to incur significant losses, and they may do so in the future. These changes in correlation have been and may in the future be exacerbated where other market participants are using risk or trading models with assumptions or algorithms that are similar to ours. In these and other cases, it may be difficult to reduce our risk positions due to the activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations, including circumstances where asset values are declining significantly or no market exists for certain assets.\nIn addition, the use of models in connection with risk management and numerous other critical activities presents risks that such models may be ineffective, either because of poor design, ineffective testing, or improper or flawed inputs, as well as unpermitted access to such models resulting in unapproved or malicious changes to the model or its inputs.\nTo the extent that we have positions through our market-making or origination activities or we make investments directly through our investing activities, including private equity, that do not have an established liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sale or hedging, we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with those positions. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable law and regulation, we invest our own capital in private equity, credit, real estate and hedge funds that we manage and limitations on our ability to withdraw some or all of our investments in these funds, whether for legal, reputational or other reasons, may make it more difficult for us to control the risk exposures relating to these investments.\nPrudent risk management, as well as regulatory restrictions, may cause us to limit our exposure to counterparties, geographic areas or markets, which may limit our business opportunities and increase the cost of our funding or hedging activities.\nAs we have expanded and intend to continue to expand the product and geographic scope of our offerings of credit products to consumers, we are presented with different credit risks and must expand and adapt our credit risk monitoring and mitigation activities to account for these business activities. A failure to adequately assess and control such risk exposures could result in losses to us.\nFor further information about our risk management policies and procedures, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Risk Management” in Part II, Item 7 of this\nForm 10-K.\nWe may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including pandemics, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters.\nThe occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including pandemics, such as\nCOVID-19,\nor other widespread health emergencies (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), terrorist attacks, extreme terrestrial or solar weather events or other natural disasters, could create economic and financial disruptions, and could lead to operational difficulties (including travel limitations and limitations on occupancy in our offices) that could impair our ability to manage our businesses.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nClimate change concerns could disrupt our businesses, adversely affect client activity levels, adversely affect the creditworthiness of our counterparties and damage our reputation.\nClimate change may cause extreme weather events that disrupt operations at one or more of our primary locations, which may negatively affect our ability to service and interact with our clients, and also may adversely affect the value of our investments, including our real estate investments. Climate change may also have a negative impact on the financial condition of our clients, which may decrease revenues from those clients and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients. Additionally, our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our involvement, or our clients’ involvement, in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. New regulations or guidance relating to climate change, as well as the perspectives of shareholders, employees and other stakeholders regarding climate change, may affect whether and on what terms and conditions we engage in certain activities or offer certain products.\nLegal and Regulatory\nOur businesses and those of our clients are subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world.\nAs a participant in the financial services industry and a systemically important financial institution, we are subject to extensive regulation in jurisdictions around the world. We face the risk of significant intervention by law enforcement, regulatory and taxing authorities, as well as private litigation, in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses. In many cases, our activities have been and may continue to be subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions. Among other things, as a result of law enforcement authorities, regulators or private parties challenging our compliance with existing laws and regulations, we or our employees have been, and could be, fined, criminally charged or sanctioned; prohibited from engaging in some of our business activities; subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities, including higher capital requirements; or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our businesses or with respect to our employees. These limitations or conditions may limit our business activities and negatively impact our profitability.\nIn addition to the impact on the scope and profitability of our business activities,\nday-to-day\ncompliance with existing laws and regulations has involved and will continue to involve significant amounts of time, including that of our senior leaders and that of a large number of dedicated compliance and other reporting and operational personnel, all of which may negatively impact our profitability.\nOur revenues and profitability and those of our competitors have been and will continue to be impacted by requirements relating to capital, additional loss-absorbing capacity, leverage, minimum liquidity and long-term funding levels, requirements related to resolution and recovery planning, derivatives clearing and margin rules and levels of regulatory oversight, as well as limitations on which and, if permitted, how certain business activities may be carried out by financial institutions.\nIf there are new laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or those of our clients, including capital, liquidity, leverage, long-term debt, total loss-absorbing capacity and margin requirements, restrictions on leveraged lending or other business practices, reporting requirements, requirements relating to recovery and resolution planning, tax burdens and compensation restrictions, that are imposed on a limited subset of financial institutions (whether based on size, method of funding, activities, geography or other criteria), compliance with these new laws or regulations, or changes in the enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way. In addition, regulation imposed on financial institutions or market participants generally, such as taxes on stock transfers and other financial transactions, could adversely impact levels of market activity more broadly, and thus impact our businesses. Changes to laws or regulations, such as tax laws, could also have a disproportionate impact on us, based on the way those laws or regulations are applied to financial services and financial firms or due to our corporate structure. For example, during the recent presidential election, the new U.S. administration offered tax policy ideas that if enacted would, among other things, increase the corporate tax rate and the U.S. tax rate on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI). Any increase in the corporate tax rate or the U.S. tax on GILTI would increase our effective tax rate and provision for taxes, possibly materially.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThese developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions, or even make it uneconomic for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in those jurisdictions, or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices, restructuring our businesses, moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other locations or complying with applicable capital requirements, including reducing dividends or share repurchases, liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our shareholders and creditors.\nU.S. and\nnon-U.S.\nregulatory developments, in particular the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, have significantly altered the regulatory framework within which we operate and have adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our profitability. Among the aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act that have affected or may in the future affect our businesses are: increased capital, liquidity and reporting requirements; limitations on activities in which we may engage; increased regulation of and restrictions on OTC derivatives markets and transactions; limitations on incentive compensation; limitations on affiliate transactions; requirements to reorganize or limit activities in connection with recovery and resolution planning; increased deposit insurance assessments; and increased standards of care for broker-dealers and investment advisers in dealing with clients. The implementation of higher capital requirements, more stringent requirements relating to liquidity, long-term debt and total loss-absorbing capacity and the prohibition on proprietary trading and the sponsorship of, or investment in, covered funds by the Volcker Rule may continue to adversely affect our profitability and competitive position, particularly if these requirements do not apply equally to our competitors or are not implemented uniformly across jurisdictions. We may also become subject to higher and more stringent capital and other regulatory requirements as a result of the implementation of Basel Committee standards, including those published in December 2017.\nAs described in “Business — Regulation — Banking Supervision and Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-K,\nthe SCB has replaced the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized Capital Rules and resulted in higher Standardized capital ratio requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could limit our ability to, among other things, repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments. In addition, if, as in 2020, we are required to resubmit our capital plan, we generally may not make capital distributions, such as share repurchases or dividends, without the prior approval of the FRB. Dividends and repurchases are also subject to oversight by the FRB, which can result in limitations. Limitations on our ability to make capital distributions could, among other things, prevent us from returning capital to our shareholders and impact our return on equity. Additionally, as a consequence of our designation as a\nG-SIB,\nwe are subject to the\nG-SIB\nsurcharge. Our\nG-SIB\nsurcharge is updated annually based on financial data from the prior year. Expansion of our businesses, growth in our balance sheet and increased reliance on short-term wholesale funding have resulted in increases and in the future may result in further increases in our\nG-SIB\nsurcharge and a corresponding increase in our capital requirements.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations, such as the GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act, relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. As new privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as our potential liability for\nnon-compliance\nand reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase.\nIn addition, our businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to surveillance, encryption and data\non-shoring\nin the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies, procedures and technology for information security, which could, among other things, make us more vulnerable to cyber attacks and misappropriation, corruption or loss of information or technology.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe have entered into consumer-oriented deposit-taking, lending and credit card businesses, and we expect to expand the product and geographic scope of our offerings. Entering into these businesses subjects us to numerous additional regulations in the jurisdictions in which these businesses operate. Not only are these regulations extensive, but they involve types of regulations and supervision, as well as regulatory compliance risks, that have not historically applied to us. The level of regulatory scrutiny and the scope of regulations affecting financial interactions with consumers is often much greater than that associated with doing business with institutions and\nhigh-net-worth\nindividuals. Complying with these regulations is time-consuming, costly and presents new and increased risks.\nIncreasingly, regulators and courts have sought to hold financial institutions liable for the misconduct of their clients where they have determined that the financial institution should have detected that the client was engaged in wrongdoing, even though the financial institution had no direct knowledge of the activities engaged in by its client. Regulators and courts have also increasingly found liability as a “control person” for activities of entities in which financial institutions or funds controlled by financial institutions have an investment, but which they do not actively manage. In addition, regulators and courts continue to seek to establish “fiduciary” obligations to counterparties to which no such duty had been assumed to exist. To the extent that such efforts are successful, the cost of, and liabilities associated with, engaging in brokerage, clearing, market-making, prime brokerage, investing and other similar activities could increase significantly. To the extent that we have fiduciary obligations in connection with acting as a financial adviser or investment adviser or in other roles for individual, institutional, sovereign or investment fund clients, any breach, or even an alleged breach, of such obligations could have materially negative legal, regulatory and reputational consequences.\nFor information about the extensive regulation to which our businesses are subject, see “Business — Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-K.\nA failure to appropriately identify and address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.\nDue to the broad scope of our businesses and our client base, we regularly address potential conflicts of interest, including situations where our services to a particular client or our own investments or other interests conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of that client or another client, as well as situations where one or more of our businesses have access to material\nnon-public\ninformation that may not be shared with our other businesses and situations where we may be a creditor of an entity with which we also have an advisory or other relationship.\nIn addition, our status as a BHC subjects us to heightened regulation and increased regulatory scrutiny by the FRB with respect to transactions between GS Bank USA and entities that are or could be viewed as affiliates of ours and, under the Volcker Rule, transactions between us and covered funds.\nWe have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address conflicts of interest, including those designed to prevent the improper sharing of information among our businesses. However, appropriately identifying and dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation, which is one of our most important assets, could be damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions with us may be adversely affected if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and deal appropriately with conflicts of interest. In addition, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. Additionally, our\nOne Goldman Sachs\ninitiative aims to increase collaboration among our businesses, which may increase the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest and improper information sharing.\nWe may be adversely affected by increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny or negative publicity.\nGovernmental scrutiny from regulators, legislative bodies and law enforcement agencies with respect to matters relating to compensation, our business practices, our past actions and other matters has increased dramatically. Political and public sentiment regarding financial institutions has in the past and may in the future result in a significant amount of adverse press coverage, as well as adverse statements or charges by regulators or other government officials. Press coverage and other public statements that assert some form of wrongdoing (including, in some cases, press coverage and public statements that do not directly involve us) often result in some type of investigation by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials or in lawsuits.\nResponding to these investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, is time-consuming and expensive and can divert the time and effort of our senior management from our business. Penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years, and certain regulators have been more likely in recent years to commence enforcement actions or to advance or support legislation targeted at the financial services industry. Adverse publicity, governmental scrutiny and legal and enforcement proceedings can also have a negative impact on our reputation and on the morale and performance of our employees, which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe financial services industry generally and our businesses in particular have been subject to negative publicity. Our reputation and businesses may be adversely affected by negative publicity or information regarding our businesses and personnel, whether or not accurate or true, that may be posted on social media or other internet forums or published by news organizations. Postings on these types of forums may also adversely impact risk positions of our clients and other parties that owe us money, securities or other assets and increase the chance that they will not perform their obligations to us or reduce the revenues we receive from their use of our services. The speed and pervasiveness with which information can be disseminated through these channels, in particular social media, may magnify risks relating to negative publicity.\nSubstantial civil or criminal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.\nWe face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K\nfor information about certain of our legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations. We have seen legal claims by consumers and clients increase in a market downturn and employment-related claims increase following periods in which we have reduced our headcount. Additionally, governmental entities have been plaintiffs and are parties in certain of our legal proceedings, and we may face future civil or criminal actions or claims by the same or other governmental entities, as well as\nfollow-on\ncivil litigation that is often commenced after regulatory settlements.\nSignificant settlements by several large financial institutions, including, in some cases, us, with governmental entities have been publicly announced. The trend of large settlements with governmental entities may adversely affect the outcomes for other financial institutions in similar actions, especially where governmental officials have announced that the large settlements will be used as the basis or a template for other settlements. The uncertain regulatory enforcement environment makes it difficult to estimate probable losses, which can lead to substantial disparities between legal reserves and subsequent actual settlements or penalties.\nClaims of collusion or anti-competitive conduct have become more common. Civil cases have been brought against financial institutions (including us) alleging bid rigging, group boycotts or other anti-competitive practices. Antitrust laws generally provide for joint and several liability and treble damages. These claims have resulted in significant settlements in the past and may do so in the future.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, including the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act, relating to corrupt and illegal payments to, and hiring practices with regard to, government officials and others. Violation of these or similar laws and regulations have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in significant monetary penalties. Such violations could also result in severe restrictions on our activities and damage to our reputation.\nCertain law enforcement authorities have recently required admissions of wrongdoing, and, in some cases, criminal pleas, as part of the resolutions of matters brought against financial institutions or their employees. See for example, “1MDB-Related Matters” in Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K.\nAny such resolution of a criminal matter involving us or our employees could lead to increased exposure to civil litigation, could adversely affect our reputation, could result in penalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our activities generally or in certain circumstances and could have other negative effects. Further, as a result of the 1MDB settlement, we are no longer a “well-known seasoned issuer,” which could place limitations on the manner in which we can market our securities.\nIn conducting our businesses around the world, we are subject to political, legal, regulatory and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries.\nIn conducting our businesses and supporting our global operations, we are subject to risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, communications and other content restrictions, and other restrictive governmental actions. For example, sanctions have been imposed by the U.S. and the E.U. on certain individuals and companies in Russia and Venezuela. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries and many of the transactions in which we are involved are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market. We are also subject to the risk that our businesses may be subject to divergent laws and regulations across markets and that the jurisdictions in which we operate may implement laws and regulations that directly conflict with those of another jurisdiction. Any determination by local regulators that we have not acted in compliance with the application of local laws in a particular market or our failure to develop effective working relationships with local regulators could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market, but also on our reputation generally. Further, in some jurisdictions a failure, or alleged failure, to comply with laws and regulations has subjected and may in the future subject us and our personnel not only to civil actions, but also criminal actions and other sanctions. We are also subject to the enhanced risk that transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWhile business and other practices throughout the world differ, our principal entities are subject in their operations worldwide to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments, hiring practices and money laundering, as well as laws relating to doing business with certain individuals, groups and countries, such as the FCPA, the USA PATRIOT Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. While we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring, the geographical diversity of our operations, employees, clients and consumers, as well as the vendors and other third parties that we deal with, greatly increases the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules or regulations and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or adversely affect our reputation. See for example, “1MDB-Related Matters” in Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K.\nIn addition, there have been a number of highly publicized cases around the world, involving actual or alleged fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years, and we have had and may in the future have employee misconduct. This misconduct has included and may also in the future include intentional efforts to ignore or circumvent applicable policies, rules or procedures or misappropriation of funds and the theft of proprietary information, including proprietary software. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity have not been and may not be effective in all cases, as reflected by the settlements relating to 1MDB.\nThe application of regulatory strategies and requirements in the U.S. and\nnon-U.S.\njurisdictions to facilitate the orderly resolution of large financial institutions could create greater risk of loss for Group Inc.’s security holders.\nAs described in “Business — Regulation — Banking Supervision and Regulation — Insolvency of an IDI or a BHC,” if the FDIC is appointed as receiver under OLA, the rights of Group Inc.’s creditors would be determined under OLA, and substantial differences exist in the rights of creditors between OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC under OLA to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances, which could have a material adverse effect on our debtholders.\nThe FDIC has announced that a single point of entry strategy may be a desirable strategy under OLA to resolve a large financial institution in a manner that would, among other things, impose losses on shareholders, debtholders and other creditors of the\ntop-tier\nBHC (in our case, Group Inc.), while the BHC’s subsidiaries may continue to operate. It is possible that the application of the single point of entry strategy under OLA, in which Group Inc. would be the only entity to enter resolution proceedings (and its material broker-dealer, bank and other operating entities would not enter resolution proceedings), would result in greater losses to Group Inc.’s security holders (including holders of our fixed rate, floating rate and indexed debt securities), than the losses that would result from the application of a bankruptcy proceeding or a different resolution strategy, such as a multiple point of entry resolution strategy for Group Inc. and certain of its material subsidiaries.\nAssuming Group Inc. entered resolution proceedings and that support from Group Inc. or other available resources to its subsidiaries was sufficient to enable the subsidiaries to remain solvent, losses at the subsidiary level would be transferred to Group Inc. and ultimately borne by Group Inc.’s security holders, third-party creditors of Group Inc.’s subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims, and Group Inc.’s security holders (including our shareholders, debtholders and other unsecured creditors) could face significant and possibly complete losses. In that case, Group Inc.’s security holders would face losses while the third-party creditors of Group Inc.’s subsidiaries would incur no losses because the subsidiaries would continue to operate and would not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, holders of Group Inc.’s eligible long-term debt and holders of Group Inc.’s other debt securities could face losses ahead of its other similarly situated creditors in a resolution under OLA if the FDIC exercised its right, described above, to disregard the priority of creditor claims.\nOLA also provides the FDIC with authority to cause creditors and shareholders of the financial company in receivership to bear losses before taxpayers are exposed to such losses, and amounts owed to the U.S. government would generally receive a statutory payment priority over the claims of private creditors, including senior creditors.\nIn addition, under OLA, claims of creditors (including debtholders) could be satisfied through the issuance of equity or other securities in a bridge entity to which Group Inc.’s assets are transferred. If such a\nsecurities-for-claims\nexchange were implemented, there can be no assurance that the value of the securities of the bridge entity would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or any part of the creditor claims for which the securities were exchanged. While the FDIC has issued regulations to implement OLA, not all aspects of how the FDIC might exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is possible.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and the E.U., have implemented, or are considering, changes to resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing entity by writing down its unsecured debt or converting its unsecured debt into equity. Such\n“bail-in”\npowers are intended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured debtholders. For example, the Bank of England requires a certain amount of intercompany funding that we provide to our material U.K. subsidiaries to contain a contractual trigger to expressly permit the Bank of England to exercise such\n“bail-in”\npowers in certain circumstances. If the intercompany funding we provide to our subsidiaries is “bailed in,” Group Inc.’s claims on its subsidiaries would be subordinated to the claims of the subsidiaries’ third-party creditors or written down. U.S. regulators are considering and\nnon-U.S.\nauthorities have adopted requirements that certain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of total loss-absorbing capacity that would pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the\ntop-tier\nBHC and, ultimately, to security holders of the\ntop-tier\nBHC in the event of failure.\nThe application of Group Inc.’s proposed resolution strategy could result in greater losses for Group Inc.’s security holders.\nIn our resolution plan, Group Inc. would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The strategy described in our resolution plan is a variant of the single point of entry strategy: Group Inc. and Goldman Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC), a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Group Inc., would recapitalize and provide liquidity to certain major subsidiaries, including through the forgiveness of intercompany indebtedness, the extension of the maturities of intercompany indebtedness and the extension of additional intercompany loans. If this strategy were successful, creditors of some or all of Group Inc.’s major subsidiaries would receive full recoveries on their claims, while Group Inc.’s security holders could face significant and possibly complete losses.\nTo facilitate the execution of our resolution plan, we formed Funding IHC. In exchange for an unsecured subordinated funding note and equity interest, Group Inc. transferred certain intercompany receivables and substantially all of its global core liquid assets (GCLA) to Funding IHC, and agreed to transfer additional GCLA above prescribed thresholds.\nWe also put in place a Capital and Liquidity Support Agreement (CLSA) among Group Inc., Funding IHC and our major subsidiaries. Under the CLSA, Funding IHC has provided Group Inc. with a committed line of credit that allows Group Inc. to draw sufficient funds to meet its cash needs during the ordinary course of business. In addition, if our financial resources deteriorate so severely that resolution may be imminent, (i) the committed line of credit will automatically terminate and the unsecured subordinated funding note will automatically be forgiven, (ii) all intercompany receivables owed by the major subsidiaries to Group Inc. will be transferred to Funding IHC or their maturities will be extended to five years, (iii) Group Inc. will be obligated to transfer substantially all of its remaining intercompany receivables and GCLA (other than an amount to fund anticipated bankruptcy expenses) to Funding IHC, and (iv) Funding IHC will be obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to the major subsidiaries. Group Inc.’s and Funding IHC’s obligations under the CLSA are secured pursuant to a related security agreement. Such actions would materially and adversely affect Group Inc.’s liquidity. As a result, during a period of severe stress, Group Inc. might commence bankruptcy proceedings at an earlier time than it otherwise would if the CLSA and related security agreement had not been implemented.\nIf Group Inc.’s proposed resolution strategy were successful, Group Inc.’s security holders could face losses while the third-party creditors of Group Inc.’s major subsidiaries would incur no losses because those subsidiaries would continue to operate and not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceedings. As part of the strategy, Group Inc. could also seek to elevate the priority of its guarantee obligations relating to its major subsidiaries’ derivative contracts or transfer them to another entity so that cross-default and early termination rights would be stayed under the ISDA Protocols, as applicable, which would result in holders of Group Inc.’s eligible long-term debt and holders of Group Inc.’s other debt securities incurring losses ahead of the beneficiaries of those guarantee obligations. It is also possible that holders of Group Inc.’s eligible long-term debt and other debt securities could incur losses ahead of other similarly situated creditors of Group Inc.’s major subsidiaries.\nIf Group Inc.’s proposed resolution strategy were not successful, Group Inc.’s financial condition would be adversely impacted and Group Inc.’s security holders, including debtholders, may as a consequence be in a worse position than if the strategy had not been implemented. In all cases, any payments to debtholders are dependent on our ability to make such payments and are therefore subject to our credit risk.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nAs a result of our recovery and resolution planning processes, including incorporating feedback from our regulators, we may incur increased operational, funding or other costs and face limitations on our ability to structure our internal organization or engage in internal or external activities in a manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient.\nOur commodities activities, particularly our physical commodities activities, subject us to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risks, including environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs.\nAs part of our commodities business, we purchase and sell certain physical commodities, arrange for their storage and transport, and engage in market making of commodities. The commodities involved in these activities may include crude oil, refined oil products, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, electric power, agricultural products, metals (base and precious), minerals (including unenriched uranium), emission credits, coal, freight and related products and indices.\nWe make investments in and finance entities that engage in the production, storage and transportation of numerous commodities, including many of the commodities referenced above.\nThese activities subject us and/or the entities in which we invest to extensive and evolving federal, state and local energy, environmental, antitrust and other governmental laws and regulations worldwide, including environmental laws and regulations relating to, among others, air quality, water quality, waste management, transportation of hazardous substances, natural resources, site remediation and health and safety. Additionally, rising climate change concerns have led to additional regulation that could increase the operating costs and adversely affect the profitability of certain of our investments.\nThere may be substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations relating to our commodities-related activities and investments. Compliance with these laws and regulations could require significant commitments of capital toward environmental monitoring, renovation of storage facilities or transport vessels, payment of emission fees and carbon or other taxes, and application for, and holding of, permits and licenses.\nCommodities involved in our intermediation activities and investments are also subject to the risk of unforeseen or catastrophic events, which are likely to be outside of our control, including those arising from the breakdown or failure of transport vessels, storage facilities or other equipment or processes or other mechanical malfunctions, fires, leaks, spills or release of hazardous substances, performance below expected levels of output or efficiency, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters or other hostile or catastrophic events. In addition, we rely on third-party suppliers or service providers to perform their contractual obligations and any failure on their part, including the failure to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices or to safely transport or store commodities, could expose us to costs or losses. Also, while we seek to insure against potential risks, we may not be able to obtain insurance to cover some of these risks and the insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover our losses.\nThe occurrence of any of such events may prevent us from performing under our agreements with clients, may impair our operations or financial results and may result in litigation, regulatory action, negative publicity or other reputational harm.\nWe may also be required to divest or discontinue certain of these activities for regulatory or legal reasons.\nCompetition\nOur results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the composition of our client base.\nOur client base is not the same as that of our major competitors. Our businesses may have a higher or lower percentage of clients in certain industries or markets than some or all of our competitors. Therefore, unfavorable industry developments or market conditions affecting certain industries or markets have resulted in the past and may result in the future in our businesses underperforming relative to similar businesses of a competitor if our businesses have a higher concentration of clients in such industries or markets. For example, our market-making businesses have a higher percentage of clients with actively managed assets than our competitors and such clients have in the past and may in the future be disproportionately affected by low volatility.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCorrespondingly, favorable or simply less adverse developments or market conditions involving industries or markets in a business where we have a lower concentration of clients in such industry or market have also resulted in the past and may result in the future in our underperforming relative to a similar business of a competitor that has a higher concentration of clients in such industry or market. For example, we have a smaller corporate client base in our market-making businesses than many of our peers and therefore those competitors may benefit more from increased activity by corporate clients. Similarly, we have not historically engaged in retail equities intermediation to the same extent as other financial institutions, which has in the past and could in the future adversely affect our market share in equities execution.\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive.\nThe financial services industry and all of our businesses are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including transaction execution, our products and services, innovation, reputation, creditworthiness and price. There has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry. This has hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. To the extent we expand into new business areas and new geographic regions, we will face competitors with more experience and more established relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants in the relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability to expand.\nGovernments and regulators have adopted regulations, imposed taxes, adopted compensation restrictions or otherwise put forward various proposals that have impacted or may impact our ability to conduct certain of our businesses in a cost-effective manner or at all in certain or all jurisdictions, including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage. These or other similar rules, many of which do not apply to all our U.S. or\nnon-U.S.\ncompetitors, could impact our ability to compete effectively.\nPricing and other competitive pressures in our businesses have continued to increase, particularly in situations where some of our competitors may seek to increase market share by reducing prices. For example, in connection with investment banking and other assignments, in response to competitive pressure we have experienced, we have extended and priced credit at levels that may not always fully compensate us for the risks we take.\nThe financial services industry is highly interrelated in that a significant volume of transactions occur among a limited number of members of that industry. Many transactions are syndicated to other financial institutions and financial institutions are often counterparties in transactions. This has led to claims by other market participants and regulators that such institutions have colluded in order to manipulate markets or market prices, including allegations that antitrust laws have been violated. While we have extensive procedures and controls that are designed to identify and prevent such activities, allegations of such activities, particularly by regulators, can have a negative reputational impact and can subject us to large fines and settlements, and potentially significant penalties, including treble damages.\nThe growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new trading technology has increased competition.\nTechnology is fundamental to our business and our industry. The growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new technologies is changing our businesses and presenting us with new challenges. Securities, futures and options transactions are increasingly occurring electronically, both on our own systems and through other alternative trading systems, and it appears that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue. Some of these alternative trading systems compete with us, particularly our exchange-based market-making activities, and we may experience continued competitive pressures in these and other areas. In addition, the increased use by our clients of\nlow-cost\nelectronic trading systems and direct electronic access to trading markets could cause a reduction in commissions and spreads. As our clients increasingly use our systems to trade directly in the markets, we may incur liabilities as a result of their use of our order routing and execution infrastructure.\nWe have invested significant resources into the development of electronic trading systems and expect to continue to do so, but there is no assurance that the revenues generated by these systems will yield an adequate return, particularly given the generally lower commissions arising from electronic trades.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur businesses would be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees.\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled people; therefore, our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses, to manage our businesses effectively and to expand into new businesses and geographic areas depends on our ability to attract new talented and diverse employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. Factors that affect our ability to attract and retain such employees include the level and composition of our compensation and benefits, and our reputation as a successful business with a culture of fairly hiring, training and promoting qualified employees. As a significant portion of the compensation that we pay to our employees is in the form of\nyear-end\ndiscretionary compensation, a significant portion of which is in the form of deferred equity-related awards, declines in our profitability, or in the outlook for our future profitability, as well as regulatory limitations on compensation levels and terms, can negatively impact our ability to hire and retain highly qualified employees.\nCompetition from within the financial services industry and from businesses outside the financial services industry, including the technology industry, for qualified employees has often been intense. We have experienced increased competition in hiring and retaining employees to address the demands of new regulatory requirements, expanding consumer-oriented businesses and our technology initiatives. This is also the case in emerging and growth markets, where we are often competing for qualified employees with entities that have a significantly greater presence or more extensive experience in the region.\nChanges in law or regulation in jurisdictions in which our operations are located that affect taxes on our employees’ income, or the amount or composition of compensation, may also adversely affect our ability to hire and retain qualified employees in those jurisdictions.\nAs described further in “Business — Regulation —Compensation Practices” in Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-K,\nour compensation practices are subject to review by, and the standards of, the FRB. As a large global financial and banking institution, we are subject to limitations on compensation practices (which may or may not affect our competitors) by the FRB, the PRA, the FCA, the FDIC and other regulators worldwide. These limitations, including any imposed by or as a result of future legislation or regulation, may require us to alter our compensation practices in ways that could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain talented employees.\nOur operating expenses and efficiency ratio depend, in part, on our overall headcount and the proportion of our employees located in strategic locations. Our future human capital resource requirements and the benefits provided by strategic locations are uncertain, and we may not realize the benefits we anticipate."

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nExecutive Overview\nWe generated net earnings of $9.46 billion for 2020, an increase of 12% compared with $8.47 billion for 2019. Diluted earnings per common share (EPS) was $24.74 for 2020, an increase of 18% compared with $21.03 for 2019. Return on average common shareholders’ equity (ROE) was 11.1% for 2020, compared with 10.0% for 2019. Book value per common share was $236.15 as of December 2020, 8.1% higher compared with December 2019.\nDuring 2020, we recorded net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $3.42 billion, which reduced diluted EPS by $9.51 and reduced ROE by 3.9 percentage points. During 2019, we recorded net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $1.24 billion, which reduced diluted EPS by $3.16 and reduced ROE by 1.5 percentage points.\nNet revenues were $44.56 billion for 2020, 22% higher than 2019. Net revenues were significantly higher in both Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equities within Global Markets, driven by strong client activity, and in Investment Banking, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in both Equity and Debt underwriting. Net revenues in Consumer & Wealth Management were higher, reflecting growth in Wealth management and Consumer banking. These increases were partially offset by lower net revenues in Asset Management, due to significantly lower net revenues in Equity investments and Lending and debt investments, which reflected the impact of a challenging environment earlier this year.\nProvision for credit losses was $3.10 billion for 2020, compared with $1.07 billion for 2019. This increase was primarily due to significantly higher provisions related to wholesale loans as a result of individual impairments and ratings downgrades during the year, as well as deterioration and uncertainty in the broader economic environment (incorporating the accounting for credit losses under the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) standard) reflecting the impact of the global outbreak of the coronavirus\n(COVID-19)\npandemic. The increase also included higher provisions related to credit card loans, due to growth in the portfolio. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about ASU\nNo. 2016-13,\n“Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326) — Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.”\nOperating expenses were $28.98 billion for 2020, 16% higher than 2019, primarily reflecting significantly higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings, higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting improved financial performance) and higher transaction based expenses (reflecting an increase in activity levels). Our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) for 2020 was 65.0%, compared with 68.1% for 2019. Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings increased our efficiency ratio for 2020 by 7.6 percentage points and for 2019 by 3.4 percentage points.\nDuring 2020, we returned $3.72 billion of capital to common shareholders, including $1.93 billion of common share repurchases, all during the first quarter, and $1.80 billion in common stock dividends. As of December 2020, our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 14.7% under the Standardized Capital Rules and 13.4% under the Advanced Capital Rules. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios.\nIn the beginning of 2020, we announced strategic initiatives related to expense efficiencies and funding optimization with an emphasis on improving profitability and shareholder returns. We estimated that by\nyear-end\n2022 we will generate (i) $1.3 billion of annual\nrun-rate\nexpense efficiencies, which will create capacity to fund growth, and (ii) $1.0 billion of annual\nrun-rate\ninterest expense savings through funding optimization from the growth of deposits and the reduction of wholesale unsecured funding. During 2020, we achieved approximately half of the expense efficiencies target of $1.3 billion, which enabled us to partially offset the cost of investment in our business and our people in 2020. While we did not achieve interest expense savings during 2020, we remain focused on achieving the $1.0 billion interest expense savings by\nyear-end\n2022, based on the current pricing of our consumer deposits, as well as higher deposit balances.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nBusiness Environment\nIn the beginning of 2020, the spread of\nCOVID-19\nacross the globe and the accompanying temporary closures of\nnon-essential\nbusinesses and\nstay-at-home\nrequirements caused a sharp contraction in global economic activity, widespread unemployment, high levels of volatility across most financial assets and global markets, an unprecedented decline in global equity prices, and a significant widening of credit spreads. Global central banks responded quickly with accommodative monetary policy by reducing policy interest rates and increasing large scale asset purchases, and the establishment of a number of facilities to support the functioning of markets and to provide liquidity to markets. In addition, governments globally intervened with fiscal policy to mitigate the impact, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in the U.S., which provided economic relief to businesses and individuals. These monetary and fiscal interventions, combined with the reopening of businesses and relaxation of earlier lockdowns, contributed to a sharp rebound in global economic activity during the second half of 2020. As a result, investors became more optimistic towards the prospect of a quicker economic recovery and a return to\npre-pandemic\nlevels, effecting sharp increases in equity prices and tighter credit spreads. Late in the year, medical professionals developed effective\nCOVID-19\nvaccines and governments began to distribute them globally, which is expected to reduce virus spread and further aid economic recovery. Additionally, the U.S. concluded a presidential election, and a second\npandemic-aid\nbill was passed that included additional unemployment benefits and direct payments to individuals.\nDespite broad improvements in the overall economy since the pandemic began, there continues to be uncertainty related to the prospects for economic growth, virus resurgence, vaccine distribution, further fiscal stimulus and geopolitical risks. See “Results of Operations — Segment Operating Results” for further information about the operating environment for each of our business segments.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nFair Value\nFair Value Hierarchy.\nTrading assets and liabilities, certain investments and loans, and certain other financial assets and liabilities, are included in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value (i.e.,\nmarked-to-market),\nwith related gains or losses generally recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings. The use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting policy.\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We measure certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). In determining fair value, the hierarchy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) gives (i) the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities (level 1 inputs), (ii) the next priority to inputs other than level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (level 2 inputs), and (iii) the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be observed in market activity (level 3 inputs). In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, we consider, among other factors, a portfolio’s net risk exposure to that input. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement.\nThe fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and liabilities may require appropriate valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as counterparty and our credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads.\nInstruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are those which require one or more significant inputs that are not observable. Level 3 financial assets represented 2.3% as of both December 2020 and December 2019, of our total assets. See Notes 4 through 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about level 3 financial assets, including changes in level 3 financial assets and related fair value measurements. Absent evidence to the contrary, instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent to the transaction date, we use other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Estimating the fair value of level 3 financial instruments requires judgments to be made. These judgments include:\nRegardless of the methodology, valuation inputs and assumptions are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nControls Over Valuation of Financial Instruments.\nMarket makers and investment professionals in our revenue-producing units are responsible for pricing our financial instruments. Our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue-producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market-clearing levels. In the event that there is a difference of opinion in situations where estimating the fair value of financial instruments requires judgment (e.g., calibration to market comparables or trade comparison, as described below), the final valuation decision is made by senior managers in independent risk oversight and control functions. This independent price verification is critical to ensuring that our financial instruments are properly valued.\nPrice Verification.\nAll financial instruments at fair value classified in levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy are subject to our independent price verification process. The objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review. Instruments that have one or more significant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Price verification strategies utilized by our independent risk oversight and control functions include:\nSee Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about fair value measurements.\nReview of Net Revenues.\nIndependent risk oversight and control functions ensure adherence to our pricing policy through a combination of daily procedures, including the explanation and attribution of net revenues based on the underlying factors. Through this process, we independently validate net revenues, identify and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a timely basis and seek to ensure that risks are being properly categorized and quantified.\nReview of Valuation Models.\nOur independent model risk management group (Model Risk), consisting of quantitative professionals who are separate from model developers, performs an independent model review and validation process of our valuation models. New or changed models are reviewed and approved prior to implementation. Models are reviewed annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and any market developments in pricing theories. See “Risk Management — Model Risk Management” for further information about the review and validation of our valuation models.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe estimate and record an allowance for credit losses related to our loans held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. We adopted ASU\nNo. 2016-13\nin January 2020, which replaced the probable incurred credit loss model for recognizing credit losses with the CECL model. As a result, our allowance for credit losses effective January 2020, reflects our estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such loans and also takes into account forecasts of future economic conditions. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about adoption of ASU\nNo. 2016-13.\nTo determine the allowance for credit losses, we classify our loans accounted for at amortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolios. These portfolios represent the level at which we have developed and documented our methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. The allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk. The determination of allowance for credit losses entails significant judgment on various risk factors. Risk factors for wholesale loans include internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators (e.g., unemployment rates and GDP), the borrower’s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower’s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include\nloan-to-value\nratio, debt service ratio and home price index. Risk factors for installment and credit card loans include Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOur estimate of credit losses entails judgment about collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. The allowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves review and approval by senior management within our independent risk oversight and control functions. Personnel within our independent risk oversight and control functions are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected credit losses. While we use the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used. Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible.\nWe also record an allowance for credit losses on lending commitments which are held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. Such allowance is determined using the same methodology as the allowance for loan losses, while also taking into consideration the probability of drawdowns or funding, and whether such commitments are cancellable by us. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance for credit losses.\nUse of Estimates\nU.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. In addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost, the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and provisions for losses that may arise from tax audits.\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment.\nEstimating the fair value of our reporting units requires judgment. Critical inputs to the fair value estimates include projected earnings and allocated equity. There is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings. The estimated carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders’ equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders’ equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill.\nIf we experience a prolonged or severe period of weakness in the business environment, financial markets, our performance or our common stock price, or additional increases in capital requirements, our goodwill could be impaired in the future.\nIdentifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Judgment is required to evaluate whether indications of potential impairment have occurred, and to test intangible assets for impairment, if required. An impairment is recognized if the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about identifiable intangible assets.\nWe also estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss in excess of the related reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings where we believe the risk of loss is more than slight. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements for information about certain judicial, litigation and regulatory proceedings. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a\ncase-by-case\nbasis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, proceeding or investigation, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases, proceedings or investigations, and the opinions and views of legal counsel.\nIn accounting for income taxes, we recognize tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about income taxes.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for information about Recent Accounting Developments.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nResults of Operations\nThe composition of our net revenues has varied over time as financial markets and the scope of our operations have changed. The composition of net revenues can also vary over the shorter term due to fluctuations in U.S. and global economic and market conditions.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOperating Environment.\nDuring 2020, the\nCOVID-19\npandemic broadly impacted the operating environment, contributing to lower global equity prices and wider credit spreads earlier in the year. The ensuing financial market volatility and negative impact to global economic activity were counteracted, in part, by monetary and fiscal support from central banks and governments globally, which contributed to a sharp rebound in global equity prices and tighter credit spreads. Market-making activities benefitted from higher levels of volatility, higher client activity, and wider\nbid-ask\nspreads. Investment banking activities benefitted from high levels of industry-wide underwriting volumes, while industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions volumes decreased, reflecting the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic on announcements in the first half of 2020.\nIf the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic turn out to be ineffective, it may lead to a decline in market-making activity levels, a continued decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions volumes, or a decline in industry-wide underwriting volumes, and declines in global equity markets or widening of credit spreads, and net revenues and the provision for credit losses would likely be negatively impacted. See “Segment Operating Results” for information about the operating environment and material trends and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations.\n2020 versus 2019.\nNet revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $44.56 billion for 2020, 22% higher than 2019, reflecting significantly higher market making and investment banking revenues, and higher investment management revenues, commissions and fees and net interest income, partially offset by significantly lower other principal transactions revenues.\nNon-Interest\nRevenues.\nInvestment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $9.14 billion for 2020, 34% higher than 2019, due to significantly higher revenues in both equity and debt underwriting, reflecting an increase in industry-wide volumes. These increases were partially offset by slightly lower revenues in financial advisory, reflecting a decrease in industry-wide completed merger and acquisitions transactions.\nInvestment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $6.92 billion for 2020, 12% higher than 2019, primarily due to higher management and other fees, reflecting the impact of higher average assets under supervision (AUS) and the impact of the full-year consolidation of GS Personal Financial Management, partially offset by a lower average effective management fee due to shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies. In addition, incentive fees were significantly higher, primarily driven by performance.\nCommissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.55 billion for 2020, 19% higher than 2019, reflecting an increase in our listed cash equity volumes, generally consistent with market volumes.\nMarket making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $15.55 billion for 2020, 53% higher than 2019, primarily due to significantly higher revenues in equity products (both derivatives and cash products), credit products, interest rate products, commodities and currencies.\nOther principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $4.65 billion for 2020, 23% lower than 2019, reflecting significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities and net losses from debt investments, partially offset by significantly higher net gains from investments in public equities.\nNet Interest Income.\nNet interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $4.75 billion for 2020, 9% higher than 2019, reflecting a decrease in interest expense primarily related to other interest-bearing liabilities, collateralized financings, long-term borrowings and deposits, each reflecting the impact of lower interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher average balances for deposits. The decrease in interest expense was largely offset by a decrease in interest income primarily related to collateralized agreements, other interest-earning assets and deposits with banks, each reflecting the impact of lower interest rates. See “Statistical Disclosures — Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity” for further information about our sources of net interest income.\nProvision for Credit Losses\nProvision for credit losses consists of provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the provision for credit losses.\nThe table below presents our provision for credit losses.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n2020 versus 2019.\nProvision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings was $3.10 billion for 2020, compared with $1.07 billion for 2019. This increase was primarily due to significantly higher provisions related to wholesale loans as a result of individual impairments (approximately $1.15 billion primarily related to borrowers in the diversified industrials, technology, media & telecommunications and natural resources industries) and ratings downgrades during the year, as well as deterioration and uncertainty in the broader economic environment (incorporating the accounting for credit losses under the CECL standard) reflecting the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic. The increase also included higher provisions related to credit card loans, due to growth in the portfolio. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about ASU\nNo. 2016-13.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation, headcount and levels of business activity. Compensation and benefits includes salaries,\nyear-end\ndiscretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits. Discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by, among other factors, the level of net revenues, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share-based compensation programs and the external environment.\nThe table below presents our operating expenses by line item and headcount.\nIn the table above, brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees has been renamed transaction based and additionally includes expenses resulting from completed transactions, which are directly related to client revenues. Such expenses were previously reported in other expenses and were $314 million for 2020 ($55 million for the first quarter of 2020, $69 million for the second quarter of 2020, $100 million for the third quarter of 2020 and $90 million for the fourth quarter of 2020), $261 million for 2019 and $292 million for 2018. Previously reported amounts have been conformed to the current presentation.\n2020 versus 2019.\nOperating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $28.98 billion for 2020, 16% higher than 2019. Our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) for 2020 was 65.0%, compared with 68.1% for 2019. Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings increased our efficiency ratio for 2020 by 7.6 percentage points and for 2019 by 3.4 percentage points.\nThe increase in operating expenses compared with 2019 primarily reflected significantly higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings and higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting improved financial performance). In addition, transaction based expenses were higher (reflecting an increase in activity levels), technology expenses were higher and expenses related to consolidated investments, including impairments, were also higher (increase was primarily in depreciation and amortization and occupancy expenses). The increase also reflected higher charitable contributions (included in other expenses), which included approximately $300 million to Goldman Sachs Gives and approximately $125 million to The Goldman Sachs Foundation during 2020. These increases were partially offset by significantly lower travel and entertainment expenses (included in market development expenses) and lower occupancy-related expenses.\nNet provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for 2020 were $3.42 billion compared with $1.24 billion for 2019.\nHeadcount increased 6% compared with December 2019, reflecting investments in new business initiatives and an increase in technology professionals.\nProvision for Taxes\nThe effective income tax rate for 2020 was 24.2%, up from the full year income tax rate of 20.0% for 2019, primarily due to an increase in provisions for\nnon-deductible\nlitigation.\nThe CARES Act was enacted in March 2020. The CARES Act includes retroactive and prospective provisions enacted to provide income tax relief and liquidity to businesses affected by the\nCOVID-19\npandemic. The legislation includes corporate income tax provisions that temporarily allow for the carryback of net operating losses and remove limitations on the use of loss carryforwards, increase interest expense deduction limitations and allow accelerated depreciation deductions on certain asset improvements. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our effective income tax rate for 2020.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nIn July 2020, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Department of the Treasury released final regulations that include an election to exempt income that is subject to a high rate of tax from Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) and proposed regulations that would conform the\nhigh-tax\nelections for purposes of GILTI and Subpart F. These final and proposed regulations did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for 2020. In September 2020, Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax regulations were released finalizing proposed regulations and supplementing final regulations that were released in 2019. These final regulations did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for 2020.\nAdditionally, in July 2020, the U.K. Finance Act 2020 (Finance Act) was enacted. The Finance Act includes a repeal of a two percentage point decrease in the U.K. corporate income tax rate that was scheduled to become effective in April 2020. The impact of this legislation did not have a material impact on our effective income tax rate for 2020.\nWe expect our 2021 income tax rate to be approximately 21%, excluding the impact of income tax benefits on employee share-based awards and any potential changes in current income tax rates.\nSegment Assets and Operating Results\nSegment Assets.\nThe table below presents assets by segment.\nThe allocation process for segment assets is based on the activities of these segments. The allocation of assets includes allocation of global core liquid assets (GCLA) (which consists of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash), which is generally included within cash and cash equivalents, collateralized agreements and trading assets on our balance sheet. Due to the integrated nature of these segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating these assets. See “Risk Management — Liquidity Risk Management” for further information about our GCLA.\nSegment Operating Results.\nThe table below presents our segment operating results.\nNet revenues in our segments include allocations of interest income and expense to specific positions in relation to the cash generated by, or funding requirements of, such positions. See Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our business segments.\nThe allocation of common shareholders’ equity and preferred stock dividends to each segment is based on the estimated amount of equity required to support the activities of the segment under relevant regulatory capital requirements. Net earnings for each segment is calculated by applying the firmwide tax rate to each segment’s\npre-tax\nearnings.\nCompensation and benefits expenses within our segments reflect, among other factors, our overall performance, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently,\npre-tax\nmargins in one segment of our business may be significantly affected by the performance of our other business segments. A description of segment operating results follows.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nInvestment Banking\nInvestment Banking generates revenues from the following:\nThe table below presents our Investment Banking assets.\nThe table below presents our Investment Banking operating results.\nThe table below presents our financial advisory and underwriting transaction volumes.\nIn the table above:\nOperating Environment.\nDuring the year, the\nCOVID-19\npandemic broadly impacted the economic environment and had a mixed impact on investment banking activity. In mergers and acquisitions, industry-wide announced transactions were negatively impacted by the pandemic, primarily in the middle of the year, contributing to a year-over-year decline in industry-wide completed transactions. In underwriting, equity valuations and a desire by clients to raise cash to strengthen their balance sheets, combined with the lower rate environment, contributed to high levels of activity across equity underwriting, including initial public offerings, and higher volumes in debt underwriting. Corporate clients increased borrowing under revolving lines of credit to address liquidity needs in the beginning of the pandemic, but have since paid down borrowed funds following the stabilization of credit markets.\nIn the future, if industry-wide announced and completed mergers and acquisitions volumes continue to decline, or if industry-wide equity and debt underwriting volumes decline, or credit spreads related to hedges on our relationship lending portfolio continue to tighten, net revenues in Investment Banking would likely be negatively impacted. In addition, a deterioration in the creditworthiness of borrowers would negatively impact the provision for credit losses.\n2020 versus 2019.\nNet revenues in Investment Banking were $9.42 billion for 2020, 24% higher than 2019, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in Underwriting. This increase was partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in Corporate lending and slightly lower net revenues in Financial advisory.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe increase in Underwriting net revenues was due to significantly higher net revenues in both Equity and Debt underwriting, reflecting an increase in industry-wide volumes. The decrease in Corporate lending net revenues primarily reflected net mark-downs on corporate loans in 2020 compared to net gains in 2019. The decrease in Financial advisory net revenues reflected a decrease in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions, primarily in the middle of the year.\nProvision for credit losses was $1.62 billion for 2020, compared with $333 million for 2019, reflecting higher impairments related to relationship lending and middle-market lending and reserve increases as a result of the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic on the broader economic environment (incorporating the accounting for credit losses under the CECL standard). See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about ASU\nNo. 2016-13.\nOperating expenses were $6.13 billion for 2020, 31% higher than 2019, primarily due to significantly higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nPre-tax\nearnings were $1.67 billion for 2020, 35% lower than 2019. Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings reduced ROE by 11.5 percentage points for 2020.\nAs of December 2020, our investment banking transaction backlog increased significantly compared with December 2019, due to significantly higher estimated net revenues from potential equity underwriting transactions, primarily from initial public offerings, and higher estimated net revenues from potential advisory transactions. Estimated net revenues from potential debt underwriting transactions were essentially unchanged.\nOur backlog represents an estimate of our net revenues from future transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. We believe changes in our backlog may be a useful indicator of client activity levels which, over the long term, impact our net revenues. However, the time frame for completion and corresponding revenue recognition of transactions in our backlog varies based on the nature of the assignment, as certain transactions may remain in our backlog for longer periods of time, which could occur in light of the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic on mergers and acquisitions. In addition, our backlog is subject to certain limitations, such as assumptions about the likelihood that individual client transactions will occur in the future. Transactions may be cancelled or modified, and transactions not included in the estimate may also occur, including underwriting transactions for which the time frame from discussion to completion has shortened in the current environment.\nGlobal Markets\nOur Global Markets segment consists of:\nFICC.\nFICC generates revenues from intermediation and financing activities.\nInterest Rate Products.\nGovernment bonds (including inflation-linked securities) across maturities, other government-backed securities, and interest rate swaps, options and other derivatives.\nCredit Products.\nInvestment-grade and high-yield corporate securities, credit derivatives, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), bank and bridge loans, municipal securities, emerging market and distressed debt, and trade claims.\nMortgages.\nCommercial mortgage-related securities, loans and derivatives, residential mortgage-related securities, loans and derivatives (including U.S. government agency-issued collateralized mortgage obligations and other securities and loans), and other asset-backed securities, loans and derivatives.\nCurrencies.\nCurrency options, spot/forwards and other derivatives on\nG-10\ncurrencies and emerging-market products.\nCommodities.\nCommodity derivatives and, to a lesser extent, physical commodities, involving crude oil and petroleum products, natural gas, base, precious and other metals, electricity, coal, agricultural and other commodity products.\nFor further information about market-making activities, see “Market-Making Activities” below.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nEquities.\nEquities generates revenues from intermediation and financing activities.\nMarket-Making Activities\nAs a market maker, we facilitate transactions in both liquid and less liquid markets, primarily for institutional clients, such as corporations, financial institutions, investment funds and governments, to assist clients in meeting their investment objectives and in managing their risks. In this role, we seek to earn the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument to us and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it from us, and vice versa (i.e., bid/offer spread). In addition, we maintain (i) market-making positions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii) positions to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities (collectively, inventory). Our inventory is recorded in trading assets (long positions) or trading liabilities (short positions) in our consolidated balance sheets.\nOur results are influenced by a combination of interconnected drivers, including (i) client activity levels and transactional bid/offer spreads (collectively, client activity), and (ii) changes in the fair value of our inventory and interest income and interest expense related to the holding, hedging and funding of our inventory (collectively, market-making inventory changes). Due to the integrated nature of our market-making activities, disaggregation of net revenues into client activity and market-making inventory changes is judgmental and has inherent complexities and limitations.\nThe amount and composition of our net revenues vary over time as these drivers are impacted by multiple interrelated factors affecting economic and market conditions, including volatility and liquidity in the market, changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, investor confidence, and other macroeconomic concerns and uncertainties.\nIn general, assuming all other market-making conditions remain constant, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads tend to result in increases in net revenues, and decreases tend to have the opposite effect. However, changes in market-making conditions can materially impact client activity levels and bid/offer spreads, as well as the fair value of our inventory. For example, a decrease in liquidity in the market could have the impact of (i) increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii) decreasing investor confidence and thereby decreasing client activity levels, and (iii) widening of credit spreads on our inventory positions.\nThe table below presents our Global Markets assets.\nThe table below presents our Global Markets operating results.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below presents our Global Markets net revenues by line item in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nIn the table above:\nOperating Environment.\nDuring 2020, Global Markets operated in an environment characterized by strong client activity, higher volatility, and wider\nbid-ask\nspreads compared with 2019, as clients reacted to economic uncertainty amid the\nCOVID-19\npandemic by repositioning investment portfolios and hedging risks across asset classes. During the initial stages of the pandemic, equity prices decreased sharply and credit spreads widened as global economic activity declined. In response, central banks and governments globally intervened with monetary easing and fiscal stimulus. This support, in conjunction with improved sentiment regarding the pace of the economic recovery, contributed to a sharp rebound in global equity prices and tighter credit spreads. At the end of 2020, the S&P 500 Index was 16% higher and the MSCI World Index was 14% higher than the end of 2019. U.S. investment-grade credit spreads were approximately 5 basis points tighter compared with the end of 2019. Additionally, market volatility was elevated as the average daily VIX was 29 for 2020, compared with an average of 15 for 2019. If macroeconomic conditions lead to a decline in activity levels,\nbid-ask\nspreads or volatility, net revenues in Global Markets would likely be negatively impacted.\n2020 versus 2019.\nNet revenues in Global Markets were $21.16 billion for 2020, 43% higher than 2019.\nNet revenues in FICC were $11.58 billion, 57% higher than 2019, primarily due to significantly higher net revenues in FICC intermediation, reflecting significantly higher net revenues across all major businesses. In addition, net revenues in FICC financing were higher, driven by resale agreements.\nThe increase in FICC intermediation net revenues reflected significantly higher client activity. The following provides information about our FICC intermediation net revenues by business, compared with 2019 results:\nNet revenues in Equities were $9.57 billion, 30% higher than 2019, due to significantly higher net revenues in Equities intermediation, reflecting significantly higher net revenues in both derivatives and cash products. This increase was partially offset by lower net revenues in Equities financing, primarily reflecting higher net funding costs, including the impact of lower yields on our global core liquid assets.\nProvision for credit losses was $274 million for 2020, compared with $35 million for 2019, reflecting loan growth and reserve increases as a result of the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic on the broader economic environment (incorporating the accounting for credit losses under the CECL standard). See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about ASU\nNo. 2016-13.\nOperating expenses were $12.81 billion for 2020, 18% higher than 2019, primarily reflecting significantly higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings, higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting improved financial performance) and higher transaction based expenses.\nPre-tax\nearnings were $8.08 billion for 2020, compared with $3.89 billion for 2019. Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings reduced ROE by 4.0 percentage points for 2020.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nAsset Management\nWe manage client assets across a broad range of investment strategies and asset classes for a diverse set of institutional clients and a network of third-party distributors around the world, including equity, fixed income and alternative investments. We provide investment solutions including those managed on a fiduciary basis by our portfolio managers, as well as those managed by a variety of third-party managers. We offer our investment solutions in a variety of structures, including separately managed accounts, mutual funds, private partnerships and other comingled vehicles. These solutions begin with identifying clients’ objectives and continue through portfolio construction, ongoing asset allocation and risk management and investment realization.\nIn addition to managing client assets, we invest in alternative investments across a range of asset classes that seek to deliver long-term accretive risk-adjusted returns. Our investing activities, which are typically longer term, include investments in corporate equity, credit, real estate and infrastructure assets.\nAsset Management generates revenues from the following:\nThe table below presents our Asset Management assets.\nThe table below presents our Asset Management operating results.\nThe table below presents our Equity investments net revenues by equity type and asset class.\nOperating Environment.\nEarly in 2020, macroeconomic concerns from the\nCOVID-19\npandemic led to lower global equity prices and wider credit spreads. These trends reversed during the remainder of the year as widespread intervention by central banks and governments globally, combined with improving economic conditions, contributed to a sharp rebound in global equity prices and tighter credit spreads, which provided a more favorable backdrop for asset management activities and investments. If the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic turn out to be ineffective, it may lead to a decline in asset prices, widening of credit spreads, and investors continuing to transition to asset classes that typically generate lower fees or investors withdrawing their assets, and net revenues in Asset Management would likely be negatively impacted.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\n2020 versus 2019.\nNet revenues in Asset Management were $7.98 billion for 2020, 11% lower than 2019, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in Equity investments and Lending and debt investments. Incentive fees were significantly higher, and Management and other fees (from our institutional and third-party distribution asset management clients) were higher.\nThe decrease in Equity investments net revenues reflected significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities, partially offset by significantly higher net gains from investments in public equities. Net gains from investments in private equities for 2020 were primarily driven by company-specific events, such as sales and capital raises, partially offset by net mark-downs driven by corporate performance.\nThe decrease in Lending and debt investments primarily reflected net losses from debt investments in 2020 compared with net gains in 2019. Lending and debt investments net revenues included approximately $1.05 billion of net interest income for 2020.\nThe increase in Incentive fees was primarily driven by performance, and the increase in Management and other fees reflected the impact of higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by a lower average effective management fee due to shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies.\nProvision for credit losses was $442 million for 2020, 61% higher than 2019, reflecting higher impairments related to the private credit and real estate portfolios and reserve increases as a result of the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic on the broader economic environment (incorporating the accounting for credit losses under the CECL standard). See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about ASU\nNo. 2016-13.\nOperating expenses were $5.14 billion for 2020, 7% higher than 2019, due to higher compensation and benefits expenses and higher expenses related to consolidated investments, including impairments.\nPre-tax\nearnings were $2.40 billion for 2020, 38% lower than 2019.\nDuring the year, we sold or announced the sale of over $4 billion of gross equity investments, with a related $2 billion expected reduction in required capital.\nConsumer & Wealth Management\nConsumer & Wealth Management helps clients achieve their individual financial goals by providing a broad range of wealth advisory and banking services, including financial planning, investment management, deposit taking, and lending. Services are offered through our global network of advisors and via our digital platforms.\nWealth Management.\nWealth management provides tailored wealth advisory services to clients across the wealth spectrum.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nConsumer Banking.\nOur Consumer banking business issues unsecured loans, through our digital platform,\nMarcus by Goldman Sachs\n(Marcus),\nand credit cards, to finance the purchases of goods or services. We also accept deposits through Marcus, in Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA) and Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB). These deposits include savings and time deposits which provide us with a diversified source of funding.\nConsumer banking revenues consist of net interest income earned on unsecured loans issued to consumers through Marcus and credit card lending activities, and net interest income allocated to consumer deposits.\nThe table below presents our Consumer & Wealth Management assets.\nThe table below presents our Consumer & Wealth Management operating results.\nOperating Environment.\nDuring 2020, the\nCOVID-19\npandemic initially negatively impacted economic activity and financial markets. In response, central banks and governments globally intervened with widespread monetary and fiscal stimulus to support the economy and financial markets. As a result, global equity prices rebounded sharply and finished the year higher than at the end of 2019. In addition, unemployment and retail spending improved throughout the year after the initial effects of the pandemic. If the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic turn out to be ineffective, it may lead to a decline in asset prices, investors continuing to favor asset classes that typically generate lower fees, investors withdrawing their assets and consumers withdrawing their deposits or deterioration in consumer credit, and net revenues and the provision for credit losses in Consumer & Wealth Management would likely be negatively impacted.\n2020 versus 2019.\nNet revenues in Consumer & Wealth Management were $6.00 billion for 2020, 15% higher than 2019.\nNet revenues in Wealth management were $4.78 billion, 10% higher than 2019, primarily reflecting higher Management and other fees, primarily reflecting the impact of higher average AUS, higher transaction volumes and the impact of the full-year consolidation of GS Personal Financial Management, partially offset by a lower average effective management fee due to shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies.\nNet revenues in Consumer banking were $1.21 billion, 40% higher than 2019, reflecting higher credit card loan and deposit balances.\nProvision for credit losses was $758 million for 2020, 79% higher than 2019, reflecting growth in credit card loans and the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic on the broader economic environment (incorporating the accounting for credit losses under the CECL standard). See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about ASU\nNo. 2016-13.\nOperating expenses were $4.90 billion for 2020, 8% higher than 2019, primarily due to higher expenses related to the impact of the full-year consolidation of GS Personal Financial Management and our credit card activities.\nPre-tax\nearnings were $337 million for 2020, 43% higher than 2019.\nTotal client assets (which includes AUS, brokerage assets and consumer deposits) exceeded $1 trillion at the end of 2020.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nAssets Under Supervision\nAUS includes our institutional clients’ assets and assets sourced through third-party distributors (both included in our Asset Management segment), as well as\nhigh-net-worth\nclients’ assets (included in our Consumer & Wealth Management segment), where we earn a fee for managing assets on a discretionary basis. This includes net assets in our mutual funds, hedge funds, credit funds, private equity funds, real estate funds, and separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors. AUS also includes client assets invested with third-party managers, private bank deposits and advisory relationships where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not have investment discretion. AUS does not include the self-directed brokerage assets of our clients.\nThe table below presents information about our firmwide\nperiod-end\nAUS by segment, asset class, distribution channel, region and vehicle.\nIn the table above:\nAsset classes, such as alternative investment and equity assets, typically generate higher fees relative to fixed income and liquidity product assets. The average effective management fee (which excludes\nnon-asset-based\nfees) we earned on our firmwide assets under supervision was 29 basis points for 2020 and 32 basis points for 2019. This decrease reflected shifts in the mix of client assets and strategies.\nWe earn management fees on client assets that we manage and also receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund’s or a separately managed account’s return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. These incentive fees are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur. Our estimated unrecognized incentive fees were $1.79 billion as of December 2020 and $1.63 billion as of December 2019. Such amounts are based on the completion of the funds’ financial statements, which is generally one quarter in arrears. These fees will be recognized, assuming no decline in fair value, if and when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of the assets.\nThe table below presents changes in our AUS.\nIn the table above, total AUS net inflows/(outflows) for 2019 included $71 billion of inflows (substantially all in equity and fixed income assets) in connection with the acquisitions of Standard & Poor’s Investment Advisory Services (SPIAS), GS Personal Financial Management and Rocaton Investment Advisors (Rocaton). SPIAS and Rocaton were included in the Asset Management segment and GS Personal Financial Management was included in the Consumer & Wealth Management segment.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below presents information about our average monthly firmwide AUS by segment and asset class.\nIn addition to our AUS, we have discretion over alternative investments where we currently do not earn management fees\n(non-fee-earning\nalternative assets).\nThe table below presents information about our AUS for alternative assets,\nnon-fee-earning\nalternative assets and total alternative assets.\nIn the table above:\nIn the beginning of 2020, we announced a strategic objective of growing our third-party alternatives business, and established targets of achieving net inflows of $100 billion and gross inflows of $150 billion for alternative assets over five years. During 2020, we raised approximately $40 billion in third-party commitments for alternative assets. As of December 2020, approximately $13 billion of these commitments were included in AUS, as they were generating fees. The remaining approximately $27 billion of such commitments were included in\nnon-fee-earning\nalternative assets in the table above, approximately $20 billion of which will begin to earn fees (and become AUS), if and when the commitments are drawn and assets are invested.\nThe table below presents information about alternative investments in our Asset Management segment that we hold on our balance sheet.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nLoans and Debt Securities.\nThe table below presents the concentration of loans and debt securities within our alternative investments by accounting classification, region and industry.\nEquity.\nThe table below presents the concentration of equity securities within our alternative investments by vintage, region and industry.\nIn the table above:\nCIE Investments and Other.\nCIE investments and other included assets held by CIEs of $19 billion, which were funded with liabilities of approximately $10 billion as of December 2020. Substantially all such liabilities were nonrecourse, thereby reducing our equity at risk.\nThe table below presents the concentration of CIE assets, net of financings, within our alternative investments by vintage, region and asset class.\nGeographic Data\nSee Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our total net revenues,\npre-tax\nearnings and net earnings by geographic region.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nBalance Sheet and Funding Sources\nBalance Sheet Management\nOne of our risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. While our asset base changes due to client activity, market fluctuations and business opportunities, the size and composition of our balance sheet also reflects factors, including (i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii) the amount of equity capital we hold and (iii) our funding profile, among other factors. See “Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital — Equity Capital Management” for information about our equity capital management process.\nAlthough our balance sheet fluctuates on a\nday-to-day\nbasis, our total assets at\nquarter-end\nand\nyear-end\ndates are generally not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods.\nIn order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities, which include (i) balance sheet planning, (ii) balance sheet limits, (iii) monitoring of key metrics and (iv) scenario analyses.\nBalance Sheet Planning.\nWe prepare a balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources over a three-year time horizon. This plan is reviewed quarterly and may be adjusted in response to changing business needs or market conditions. The objectives of this planning process are:\nTreasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions, along with our revenue-producing units, review current and prior period information and expectations for the year to prepare our balance sheet plan. The specific information reviewed includes asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization, risk and performance measures, and capital usage.\nOur consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance sheets by business, funding projections and projected key metrics, is reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee and the Risk Governance Committee. See “Risk Management — Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for an overview of our risk management structure.\nBalance Sheet Limits.\nThe Firmwide Asset Liability Committee and the Risk Governance Committee have the responsibility to review and approve balance sheet limits. These limits are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite, in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion among our revenue-producing units, Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions on a routine basis. Requests for changes in limits are evaluated after giving consideration to their impact on our key metrics. Compliance with limits is monitored by our revenue-producing units and Treasury, as well as our independent risk oversight and control functions.\nMonitoring of Key Metrics.\nWe monitor key balance sheet metrics both by business and on a consolidated basis, including asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization and risk measures. We allocate assets to businesses and review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity, as well as market fluctuations.\nScenario Analyses.\nWe conduct various scenario analyses, including as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Stress Tests (DFAST), as well as our resolution and recovery planning. See “Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital — Equity Capital Management” for further information about these scenario analyses. These scenarios cover short- and long-term time horizons using various macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, based on a range of economic scenarios. We use these analyses to assist us in developing our longer-term balance sheet management strategy, including the level and composition of assets, funding and equity capital. Additionally, these analyses help us develop approaches for maintaining appropriate funding, liquidity and capital across a variety of situations, including a severely stressed environment.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nBalance Sheet Analysis and Metrics\nAs of December 2020, total assets in our consolidated balance sheets were $1.16 trillion, an increase of $170.06 billion from December 2019, primarily reflecting increases in customer and other receivables of $46.73 billion (primarily reflecting higher client activity), trading assets of $38.30 billion (primarily due to increases in derivative instruments reflecting the impact of changes in interest rates and equity prices and increases in\nnon-U.S.\ngovernment and agency obligations reflecting our and our clients’ activities), collateralized agreements of $28.46 billion (reflecting the impact of our and our clients’ activities), investments of $24.51 billion (primarily reflecting an increase in U.S. government obligations accounted for as\navailable-for-sale),\nand cash and cash equivalents of $22.30 billion (primarily reflecting the impact of our activity). As of December 2020, approximately 25% of our total assets were held in our bank subsidiaries.\nAs of December 2020, total liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets were $1.07 trillion, an increase of $164.39 billion from December 2019, primarily reflecting increases in deposits of $69.94 billion (reflecting increases in consumer, transaction banking and private bank deposits), trading liabilities of $44.89 billion (primarily due to increases in equities and government obligations reflecting higher client activity and increases in derivative instruments reflecting the impact of changes in interest rate and equity price movements), collateralized financings of $21.93 billion (reflecting the impact of our and our clients’ activities), and customer and other payables of $15.84 billion (primarily reflecting higher client activity).\nOur total securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements), accounted for as collateralized financings, were $126.57 billion as of December 2020 and $117.76 billion as of December 2019, which were 24% higher as of December 2020 and 32% higher as of December 2019 than the average daily amount of repurchase agreements over the respective quarters, and 31% higher as of December 2020 and 40% higher as of December 2019 than the average daily amount of repurchase agreements over the respective years. As of December 2020, the increase in our repurchase agreements relative to the average daily amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter and year resulted from higher levels of our and our clients’ activities at the end of the period.\nThe level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between and within periods, primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral, such as liquid government and agency obligations, through collateralized financing activities.\nThe table below presents information about our balance sheet and leverage ratios.\nIn the table above:\nThe table below presents information about our shareholders’ equity and book value per common share, including the reconciliation of common shareholders’ equity to tangible common shareholders’ equity.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFunding Sources\nOur primary sources of funding are deposits, collateralized financings, unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, and shareholders’ equity. We seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and creditors to avoid funding concentrations.\nThe table below presents information about our funding sources.\nOur funding is primarily raised in U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound and Japanese yen. We generally distribute our funding products through our own sales force and third-party distributors to a large, diverse creditor base in a variety of markets in the Americas, Europe and Asia. We believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity. Our creditors include banks, governments, securities lenders, corporations, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and individuals. We have imposed various internal guidelines to monitor creditor concentration across our funding programs.\nDeposits.\nOur deposits provide us with a diversified source of funding and reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. We raise deposits, including savings, demand and time deposits, from private bank clients, consumers, transaction banking clients, other institutional clients, and through internal and third-party broker-dealers. Substantially all of our deposits are raised through GS Bank USA and GSIB. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our deposits.\nSecured Funding.\nWe fund a significant amount of inventory and a portion of investments on a secured basis. Secured funding includes collateralized financings in the consolidated balance sheets. We may also pledge our inventory and investments as collateral for securities borrowed under a securities lending agreement. We also use our own inventory and investments to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased. Secured funding is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecured funding, due to our posting of collateral to our lenders. Nonetheless, we analyze the refinancing risk of our secured funding activities, taking into account trade tenors, maturity profiles, counterparty concentrations, collateral eligibility and counterparty rollover probabilities. We seek to mitigate our refinancing risk by executing term trades with staggered maturities, diversifying counterparties, raising excess secured funding and\npre-funding\nresidual risk through our GCLA.\nWe seek to raise secured funding with a term appropriate for the liquidity of the assets that are being financed, and we seek longer maturities for secured funding collateralized by asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis, especially during times of market stress. Our secured funding, excluding funding collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations, is primarily executed for tenors of one month or greater and is primarily executed through term repurchase agreements and securities loaned contracts.\nThe weighted average maturity of our secured funding included in collateralized financings in the consolidated balance sheets, excluding funding that can only be collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations,\nexceeded 120 days as of December 2020.\nAssets that may be harder to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress include certain financial instruments in the following categories: mortgage and other asset-backed loans and securities,\nnon-investment-grade\ncorporate debt securities, equity securities and emerging market securities. Assets that are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are generally funded on an unsecured basis. See Notes 4 through 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy and “Unsecured Long-Term Borrowings” below for further information about the use of unsecured long-term borrowings as a source of funding.\nWe also raise financing through other types of collateralized financings, such as secured loans and notes. GS Bank USA has access to funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank. We had no outstanding borrowings against the Federal Home Loan Bank as of December 2020 and $527 million as of December 2019. Additionally, we have access to funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. However, we do not rely on this funding in our liquidity planning and stress testing.\nUnsecured Short-Term Borrowings.\nA significant portion of our unsecured short-term borrowings was originally long-term debt that is scheduled to mature within one year of the reporting date. We use unsecured short-term borrowings, including U.S. and\nnon-U.S.\nhybrid financial instruments and commercial paper, to finance liquid assets and for other cash management purposes. In accordance with regulatory requirements, Group Inc. does not issue debt with an original maturity of less than one year, other than to its subsidiaries. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured short-term borrowings.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nUnsecured Long-Term Borrowings.\nUnsecured long-term borrowings, including structured notes, are raised through syndicated U.S. registered offerings, U.S. registered and Rule 144A medium-term note programs, offshore medium-term note offerings and other debt offerings. We issue in different tenors, currencies and products to maximize the diversification of our investor base.\nThe table below presents our quarterly unsecured long-term borrowings maturity profile.\nThe weighted average maturity of our unsecured long-term borrowings as of December 2020 was approximately seven years. To mitigate refinancing risk, we seek to limit the principal amount of debt maturing over the course of any monthly, quarterly or annual time horizon. We enter into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our unsecured long-term borrowings into floating-rate obligations to manage our exposure to interest rates. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured long-term borrowings.\nShareholders’ Equity.\nShareholders’ equity is a stable and perpetual source of funding. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our shareholders’ equity.\nEquity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital\nCapital adequacy is of critical importance to us. We have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to assist us in maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital in both\nbusiness-as-usual\nand stressed conditions.\nEquity Capital Management\nWe determine the appropriate amount and composition of our equity capital by considering multiple factors, including our current and future regulatory capital requirements, the results of our capital planning and stress testing process, the results of resolution capital models and other factors, such as rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment and conditions in the financial markets.\nWe manage our capital requirements and the levels of our capital usage principally by setting limits on the balance sheet and/or limits on risk, in each case at both the firmwide and business levels.\nWe principally manage the level and composition of our equity capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock.\nWe may issue, redeem or repurchase our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts, and other subordinated debt or other forms of capital as business conditions warrant. Prior to such redemptions or repurchases, we must receive approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). See Notes 14 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our preferred stock, junior subordinated debt issued to trusts and other subordinated debt.\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing Process.\nAs part of capital planning, we project sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments, including stressed conditions. Our stress testing process is designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities, including market risk, credit risk and operational risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues.\nOur capital planning process incorporates an internal capital adequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our businesses. We incorporate stress scenarios into our capital planning process with a goal of holding sufficient capital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event. Our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into our overall risk management structure, governance and policy framework.\nOur stress tests incorporate our internally designed stress scenarios, including our internally developed severely adverse scenario, and those required by the FRB, and are designed to capture our specific vulnerabilities and risks. We provide further information about our stress test processes and a summary of the results on our website as described in “Business — Available Information” in Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-K.\nAs required by the FRB’s CCAR rules, we submit an annual capital plan for review by the FRB. The purpose of the FRB’s review is to ensure that we have a robust, forward-looking capital planning process that accounts for our unique risks and that permits continued operation during times of economic and financial stress.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe FRB evaluates us based, in part, on whether we have the capital necessary to continue operating under the baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB and those developed internally. This evaluation also takes into account our process for identifying risk, our controls and governance for capital planning, and our guidelines for making capital planning decisions. In addition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions (i.e., dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions of stock, subordinated debt or other capital securities) and issue capital, across the range of macroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific assumptions. The FRB determines the stress capital buffer (SCB) applicable to us based on its own annual stress test. The SCB under the Standardized approach is calculated as (i) the difference between our starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario and (ii) our planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon, expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets (RWAs).\nWe submitted our 2020 CCAR capital plan in April 2020 and published a summary of our annual DFAST results in June 2020. See “Business — Available Information” in Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-K.\nWith respect to our 2020 CCAR submission, the FRB notified us that our SCB beginning on October 1, 2020 is 6.6%, bringing our Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement to 13.6%. In light of the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic on the economy, the FRB required all large bank holding companies (BHCs) to suspend stock repurchases through the fourth quarter of 2020 and not to increase common stock dividends or pay common stock dividends in excess of their average net income over the prior four quarters. The FRB also required large BHCs, including us, to resubmit their capital plans in November 2020 under the updated scenarios provided by the FRB, and released the results of the resubmissions in December 2020.\nThe FRB did not change our SCB as a result of our resubmission, but has extended the period to recalculate it to March 31, 2021. The FRB also modified the existing restrictions on capital actions by permitting stock repurchases and common stock dividends, that in aggregate, do not exceed the average net income over the prior four quarters and requiring large BHCs to not increase their common stock dividend in the first quarter of 2021. We plan to maintain both common and preferred dividends, and resumed common stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2021, while complying with these capital restrictions. In addition, we will continue deploying capital to our businesses where returns are accretive and otherwise return it to our shareholders as permitted by the FRB.\nGS Bank USA has its own capital planning process, but was not required to submit its annual stress test results to the FRB in 2020. Based on growth in GS Bank USA’s average balance sheet, it will be required to submit its annual stress test results in 2022. Goldman Sachs International (GSI), GSIB and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE) also have their own capital planning and stress testing process, which incorporates internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of their respective regulators.\nContingency Capital Plan.\nAs part of our comprehensive capital management policy, we maintain a contingency capital plan. Our contingency capital plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to, identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as mitigants and potential actions. It outlines the appropriate communication procedures to follow during a crisis period, including internal dissemination of information, as well as timely communication with external stakeholders.\nCapital Attribution.\nWe assess each of our businesses’ capital usage based on our internal assessment of risks, which incorporates an attribution of our relevant regulatory capital requirements. These regulatory capital requirements are allocated using our attributed equity framework, which takes into consideration our most binding capital constraints. Our most binding capital constraint is based on the results of the FRB’s annual stress test, which includes the Standardized risk-based capital and leverage ratios. See “Segment Assets and Operating Results — Segment Operating Results” for information about our attributed equity by segment. Effective on January 1, 2021, we adjusted the attributed equity framework in line with the impact of the SCB Rule and our SCB of 6.6%, which became effective on October 1, 2020 under the Standardized approach.\nShare Repurchase Program.\nWe use our share repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with\nRule 10b5-1\nand accelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital position and our capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of CCAR. The amounts and timing of the repurchases may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nAs of December 2020, the remaining share authorization under our existing repurchase program was 49.7 million shares. See “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Part II, Item 5 of this\nForm 10-K\nand Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our share repurchase program, and see above for information about our capital planning and stress testing process.\nResolution Capital Models.\nIn connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established a Resolution Capital Adequacy and Positioning framework, which is designed to ensure that our major subsidiaries (GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), GSI, GSIB, Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P., Goldman Sachs Asset Management International (GSAMI) and GSBE) have access to sufficient loss-absorbing capacity (in the form of equity, subordinated debt and unsecured senior debt) so that they are able to wind-down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy.\nIn addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board) with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.\nRating Agency Guidelines\nThe credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of Group Inc., which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of our senior unsecured debt obligations. GS&Co. and GSI have been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings by certain credit rating agencies. GS Bank USA, GSIB and GSBE have also been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings, as well as ratings on their long- and short-term bank deposits. In addition, credit rating agencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations of certain other subsidiaries of Group Inc.\nThe level and composition of our equity capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings. Each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation. See “Risk Management — Liquidity Risk Management — Credit Ratings” for further information about credit ratings of Group Inc., GS Bank USA, GSIB, GSBE, GS&Co. and GSI.\nConsolidated Regulatory Capital\nWe are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). Under the Capital Framework, we are an “Advanced approach” banking organization and have been designated as a global systemically important bank\n(G-SIB).\nThe capital requirements calculated under the Capital Framework include the capital conservation buffer requirements, comprised of a 2.5% buffer (under the Advanced Capital Rules), a stress capital buffer (under the Standardized Capital Rules), and a countercyclical buffer and the\nG-SIB\nsurcharge (under both Capital Rules). Our\nG-SIB\nsurcharge is 2.5% for 2020, 2021 and 2022. We expect that our\nG-SIB\nsurcharge will be 3.0% beginning in 2023. The\nG-SIB\nsurcharge and countercyclical buffer in the future may differ due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes, and our SCB is likely to change from year to year based on the results of the annual supervisory stress tests. Our target Standardized CET1 capital ratio over the medium term is between 13.0% and 13.5% (including management buffers) based upon the execution of our previously announced strategic initiatives and achievement of capital efficiencies.\nSee Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios, and the Capital Framework.\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)\nWe are also subject to the FRB’s TLAC and related requirements. Failure to comply with the TLAC and related requirements could result in restrictions being imposed by the FRB and could limit our ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments.\nThe table below presents TLAC and external long-term debt requirements.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below presents information about our TLAC and external long-term debt ratios.\nIn the table above:\nSee “Business — Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-K\nfor further information about TLAC.\nSubsidiary Capital Requirements\nMany of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to separate regulation and capital requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate.\nBank Subsidiaries.\nGS Bank USA is our primary U.S. banking subsidiary and GSIB and GSBE are our primary\nnon-U.S.\nbanking subsidiaries. These entities are subject to regulatory capital requirements. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the regulatory capital requirements of our bank subsidiaries.\nU.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries.\nGS&Co. is our primary U.S. regulated broker-dealer subsidiary and is subject to regulatory capital requirements, including those imposed by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. In addition, GS&Co. is a registered futures commission merchant and is subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by the CFTC, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the National Futures Association.\nRule 15c3-1\nof the SEC and Rule 1.17 of the CFTC specify uniform minimum net capital requirements, as defined, for their registrants, and also effectively require that a significant part of the registrants’ assets be kept in relatively liquid form. GS&Co. has elected to calculate its minimum capital requirements in accordance with the “Alternative Net Capital Requirement” as permitted by\nRule 15c3-1.\nGS&Co. had regulatory net capital, as defined by\nRule 15c3-1,\nof $22.38 billion as of December 2020 and $20.88 billion as of December 2019, which exceeded the amount required by $18.45 billion as of December 2020 and $18.15 billion as of December 2019. In addition to its alternative minimum net capital requirements, GS&Co. is also required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $1 billion and net capital in excess of $500 million in accordance with the market and credit risk standards of Appendix E of\nRule 15c3-1.\nGS&Co. is also required to notify the SEC in the event that its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. As of both December 2020 and December 2019, GS&Co. had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of both the minimum and the notification requirements.\nNon-U.S.\nRegulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries.\nOur principal\nnon-U.S.\nregulated broker-dealer subsidiaries include GSI and GSJCL.\nGSI, our U.K. broker-dealer, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\nGSI is subject to the capital framework for E.U.-regulated financial institutions prescribed in the E.U. Fourth Capital Requirements Directive and the E.U. Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). These capital regulations are largely based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (Basel Committee) capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (Basel III).\nThe table below presents GSI’s risk-based capital requirements.\nIn the table above, the risk-based capital requirements incorporate capital guidance received from the PRA and could change in the future.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below presents information about GSI’s risk-based capital ratios.\nIn the table above, CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital as of December 2020 excluded GSI’s undistributed profits from October 2020 through December 2020, as such profits have not yet been approved to be included as regulatory capital by the PRA.\nIn June 2019, the European Commission finalized an amendment to the CRR that establishes a 3% leverage ratio requirement for certain E.U. financial institutions. This leverage ratio compares the CRR’s definition of Tier 1 capital to a measure of leverage exposure, defined as the sum of certain assets plus certain\noff-balance\nsheet exposures (which include a measure of derivatives, securities financing transactions, commitments and guarantees), less Tier 1 capital deductions. Following Brexit, GSI will become subject to a similar\nPRA-required\nleverage ratio that is expected to become effective in January 2022. GSI had a leverage ratio of 4.6% as of both December 2020 and December 2019. GSI’s leverage ratio as of December 2020 excluded GSI’s undistributed profits from October 2020 through December 2020, as such profits have not yet been approved to be included as regulatory capital by the PRA. This leverage ratio is based on our current interpretation and understanding of this rule and may evolve as we discuss the interpretation and application of this rule with GSI’s regulators.\nGSI is also subject to a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities issued to affiliates. This requirement is subject to a transitional period which began to phase in from January 2019 and will become fully effective beginning in January 2022. As of December 2020, GSI was in compliance with this requirement.\nGSJCL, our Japanese broker-dealer, is regulated by Japan’s Financial Services Agency. GSJCL and certain other\nnon-U.S.\nsubsidiaries are also subject to capital requirements promulgated by authorities of the countries in which they operate. As of both December 2020 and December 2019, these subsidiaries were in compliance with their local capital requirements.\nRegulatory and Other Matters\nRegulatory Matters\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation and supervision worldwide. Regulations have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide. Given that many of the new and proposed rules are highly complex, the full impact of regulatory reform will not be known until the rules are implemented and market practices develop under the final regulations.\nSee “Business — Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-K\nfor further information about the laws, rules and regulations and proposed laws, rules and regulations that apply to us and our operations.\nOther Matters\nBrexit.\nThe E.U. and the U.K. agreed to a withdrawal agreement (the Withdrawal Agreement), which became effective on January 31, 2020. The transition period under the Withdrawal Agreement ended on December 2020, after which E.U. law ceased to apply to the U.K. Effective December 31, 2020, and notwithstanding the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the E.U. and U.K. reached at the end of 2020, firms established in the U.K., including our U.K. subsidiaries, have lost their\npan-E.U.\n“passports” and are generally treated as any other entities in countries outside the E.U. whose access to the E.U. is governed by the E.U. and national law.\nThe U.K. has adopted E.U. financial services legislation that was in effect on December 31, 2020, which means that the U.K. financial services regime will remain substantially the same as under E.U. financial services legislation. However, in the future the U.K. may diverge from E.U. legislation and may decide not to adopt rules that correspond to E.U. legislation not already operative in the U.K.\nWe had prepared for a scenario where the U.K. financial services firms lost access to E.U. markets. Accordingly, we have managed to continue servicing our E.U. client base in the following manner:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nReplacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), including LIBOR.\nCentral banks and regulators in a number of major jurisdictions (for example, U.S., U.K., E.U., Switzerland and Japan) have convened working groups to find, and implement the transition to suitable replacements for IBORs. The administrator of LIBOR has proposed to extend the publication of the most commonly used U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings to June 30, 2023 and to cease publishing other LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021. The U.S. federal banking agencies have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using the U.S. Dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021.\nMarket-led\nworking groups in major jurisdictions, noted above, have already selected their preferred alternative risk-free reference rates. They have published and are expected to continue to publish consultations on issues, including methodologies for fallback provisions in contracts and financial instruments linked to IBORs and the development of term structures for alternative risk-free reference rates, which will be critical for financial markets to transition to the use of alternative risk-free reference rates in place of IBORs.\nIn October 2020, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) launched the IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, which became effective in January 2021 and provides derivatives market participants with new fallbacks for legacy and new derivatives contracts. Both counterparties will have to adhere to the Fallbacks Protocol or engage in bilateral amendments for the terms to be effective for derivative contracts. We have adhered to the Fallbacks Protocol for our eligible derivative contracts.\nWe are facilitating an orderly transition from IBORs to alternative risk-free reference rates for us and our clients. Our centralized LIBOR transition program continues to make progress with a focus on:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nAs part of this program, we have sought to systematically identify the risks inherent in this transition, including financial risks (for example, earnings volatility under stress due to widening swap spreads and the loss of funding sources as a result of counterparties’ reluctance to participate in transitioning their positions) and nonfinancial risks (for example, the inability to negotiate fallbacks with clients and/or counterparties, the potential for disputes relating to the interpretation and implementation of fallback provision and operational impediments to the transition).\nThe markets for alternative risk-free reference rates continue to develop and, where liquidity allows, we have begun participating in alternative risk-free reference rate markets. In particular, during 2020 we have:\nIn addition, in 2020, we, alongside the industry, successfully transitioned the discounting conventions of centrally cleared Euro interest rate derivatives from the Euro Overnight Index Average to the Euro Short-Term Rate and centrally cleared U.S. Dollar interest rate derivatives from Federal Funds to SOFR at Chicago Mercantile Exchange, London Clearing House and Eurex Exchange.\nWe are engaged with a range of industry and regulatory working groups (for example, ISDA, the Bank of England’s Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates, the Federal Reserve’s Alternative Reference Rates Committee and the Canadian Alternative Reference Rate Working Group) and will continue to engage with our clients and counterparties to facilitate an orderly transition to alternative risk-free reference rates.\nImpact of\nCOVID-19\nPandemic.\nThe resurgence in the spread of\nCOVID-19\ntoward the end of 2020 and into 2021 has created greater uncertainty regarding the economic outlook for the near term, even as early efforts to distribute vaccines are underway. While governments and central banks continued to be aggressive in providing fiscal and monetary stimulus, the global economic recovery remains fragile.\nWe have continued to successfully execute on our Business Continuity Planning (BCP) strategy since initially activating it in the first quarter of 2020 in response to the emergence of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic. Our priority has been to safeguard our employees and to seek to ensure continuity of business operations on behalf of our clients. Our business continuity response to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic is managed by a central team, which is led by our chief administrative officer and chief medical officer, and includes senior management within Risk and the chief operating officers across all regions and businesses. As a result of our BCP strategy, the majority of our employees worked remotely during most of 2020 and continue to do so in January 2021. In order to\nre-open\nour offices to employees after initial restrictions began to ease in the second quarter of 2020, we established policies and protocols to address safety considerations, taking into account the readiness of people, communities and facilities. Over the course of the pandemic, the extent to which our employees have worked from our offices has varied based on how circumstances in each location have evolved. We are in constant dialogue with key stakeholders to assess health and safety conditions across all of our office locations and to have robust procedures in place to protect the well-being of employees, such as controls around building access, strict physical distancing measures, enhanced cleaning regimes and\non-site\nCOVID-19\ntesting.\nOur systems and infrastructure have been robust throughout the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, enabling us to conduct our activities without disruption. We continue to maintain regular and active communication among our senior management, the rest of our employees and the Board, and our decision-making processes have remained disciplined and rigorous throughout the pandemic. Since the beginning of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, our Management Committee and other senior leaders have met regularly and our executive officers have provided regular and enhanced communications to promote connectivity with our clients and employees worldwide. In addition, as part of our vendor management processes, we have ongoing dialogues with third-party service providers, which are intended to ensure that they continue to meet our criteria for business continuity.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOur liquidity position during 2020 remained strong, as our GCLA averaged $283 billion for the year. We have continued to access our traditional funding sources in the normal course and service our debt and other obligations on a timely basis. Our CET1 capital ratios under the Standardized approach increased to 14.7% as of December 2020, up 140 basis points compared with December 2019, as we continued to support our clients, while managing our capital. We suspended stock repurchases during the first quarter of 2020 and, consistent with the FRB’s requirement for all large BHCs, extended the suspension of stock repurchases through the fourth quarter of 2020. We resumed stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2021. See “Balance Sheet and Funding Sources,” “Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital” and “Liquidity Risk Management” for further information.\nAs a result of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, we have had to apply a greater degree of judgment in making certain accounting estimates and assumptions. The process of estimating the allowance for credit losses is inherently judgmental in nature, given that it involves forecasts of future economic conditions. The uncertainty as to the severity and duration of the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic has made this process more challenging, as it has resulted in greater subjectivity in our economic forecasts. This uncertainty also impacts the estimation of the fair value for less liquid financial instruments that lack price transparency, where valuation involves judgment regarding estimated future cash flows or other significant unobservable inputs. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our allowance for credit losses and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about fair value measurements. In addition, we assessed goodwill for impairment as of December 2020 and determined that it was not impaired. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill.\nThe\nCOVID-19\npandemic gave rise to higher volatility levels in financial markets and correspondingly higher client activity levels. We have assisted clients in navigating the unpredictable and unprecedented operating environment by providing complex risk intermediation, financing solutions and bespoke advice, utilizing our balance sheet, as necessary. Our average daily\nValue-at-Risk\n(VaR) for 2020 was $94 million, $38 million higher than 2019. We have maintained our proactive approach to managing market risk levels, which entails ongoing review and monitoring of exposures and focusing on ways to mitigate risk. With respect to credit risk, the improvement in economic conditions in the second half of 2020 from the significant contraction in the second quarter of 2020 has, in general, helped to stabilize conditions in the credit markets. In relationship lending, the drawn balance on credit lines, which spiked early in the pandemic, was back to\npre-pandemic\nlevels as of December 2020. While borrowers, in general, faced less challenging circumstances in the second half of the year, credit risk remains high for borrowers in industries that continue to face significant disruptions due to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, such as companies in the oil and gas, gaming and lodging, and airlines industries. Throughout this crisis, we have remained highly focused on monitoring of credit exposures and management of margin calls and disputes. Our risk positions remained balanced, controlled and adequately provisioned for, both in terms of counterparty risk and sector exposure. See “Market Risk Management” and “Credit Risk Management” for further information.\nOur actions in response to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic have included granting forbearance to certain corporate and other borrowers who have made requests to defer payments. We had approximately $880 million of corporate loans and approximately $155 million of commercial real estate loans under forbearance as of December 2020. We have continued to provide relief to consumers through programs to help them manage the financial challenges that they face as a result of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic. The accommodations under these programs include providing borrowers of installment and credit card loans the ability to modify or defer payments without incurring interest charges and permitting Marcus depositors to access certificates of deposit early without a penalty. As of December 2020, installment and credit card loans with a gross carrying value of approximately $120 million were enrolled in such programs. In aggregate, loans under forbearance or relief programs represented approximately 1% of total loans.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe unpredictability of the trajectory of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic has significantly diminished visibility into the future operating environment. A sustained period of weak economic conditions as a result of the pandemic would be detrimental to our businesses as it would negatively affect factors that are important to our operating performance, such as the level of client activity, creditworthiness of counterparties and borrowers, and the amount of our AUS. We are monitoring the ongoing developments as the\nCOVID-19\nvaccines are being distributed and administered, and will take further action that are in the best interests of our employees, clients and counterparties. For further information about the risks associated with the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, see “Business — Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this\nForm 10-K.\nOff-Balance\nSheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nOff-Balance\nSheet Arrangements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into various types of\noff-balance\nsheet arrangements. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including:\nWe enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes, including securitizations. The securitization vehicles that purchase mortgages, corporate bonds, and other types of financial assets are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets, including the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities markets, since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process.\nWe also enter into these arrangements to underwrite client securitization transactions; provide secondary market liquidity; make investments in performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets, equity securities, real estate and other assets; provide investors with credit-linked and asset-repackaged notes; and receive or provide letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and settlement process.\nThe table below presents where information about our various\noff-balance\nsheet arrangements may be found in this\nForm 10-K.\nIn addition, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for information about our consolidation policies.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have certain contractual obligations which require us to make future cash payments. These contractual obligations include our time deposits, secured long-term financings, unsecured long-term borrowings, interest payments and operating lease payments.\nOur obligations to make future cash payments also include our commitments and guarantees related to\noff-balance\nsheet arrangements, which are excluded from the table below. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about such commitments and guarantees.\nDue to the uncertainty of the timing and amounts that will ultimately be paid, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the table below. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe table below presents our contractual obligations by type.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below presents our contractual obligations by expiration.\nIn the table above:\nRisk Management\nRisks are inherent in our businesses and include liquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal, compliance, conduct, regulatory and reputational risks. Our risks include the risks across our risk categories, regions or global businesses, as well as those which have uncertain outcomes and have the potential to materially impact our financial results, our liquidity and our reputation. For further information about our risk management processes, see “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” and for information about our areas of risk, see “Liquidity Risk Management,” “Market Risk Management,” “Credit Risk Management,” “Operational Risk Management” and “Model Risk Management” and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this\nForm 10-K.\nOverview and Structure of Risk Management\nOverview\nWe believe that effective risk management is critical to our success. Accordingly, we have established an enterprise risk management framework that employs a comprehensive, integrated approach to risk management, and is designed to enable comprehensive risk management processes through which we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities. Our risk management structure is built around three core components: governance, processes and people.\nGovernance.\nRisk management governance starts with the Board, which both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee, oversees our risk management policies and practices implemented through the enterprise risk management framework. The Board is also responsible for the annual review and approval of our risk appetite statement. The risk appetite statement describes the levels and types of risk we are willing to accept or to avoid, in order to achieve our objectives included in our strategic business plan, while remaining in compliance with regulatory requirements. The Board reviews our strategic business plan and is ultimately responsible for overseeing and providing direction about our strategy and risk appetite.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe Board receives regular briefings on firmwide risks, including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk, operational risk and model risk from our independent risk oversight and control functions, including the chief risk officer, and on compliance risk and conduct risk from Compliance, on legal and regulatory enforcement matters from the general counsel, and on other matters impacting our reputation from the chair of our Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee and our Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. The chief risk officer reports to our chief executive officer and to the Risk Committee of the Board. As part of the review of the firmwide risk portfolio, the chief risk officer regularly advises the Risk Committee of the Board of relevant risk metrics and material exposures, including risk limits and thresholds established in our risk appetite statement.\nThe implementation of our risk governance structure and core risk management processes are overseen by Enterprise Risk, which reports to our chief risk officer, and is responsible for ensuring that our enterprise risk management framework provides the Board, our risk committees and senior management with a consistent and integrated approach to managing our various risks in a manner consistent with our risk appetite.\nOur revenue-producing units, as well as Treasury, Engineering, Human Capital Management, Operations, and Corporate and Workplace Solutions, are considered our first line of defense. They are accountable for the outcomes of our risk-generating activities, as well as for assessing and managing those risks within our risk appetite.\nOur independent risk oversight and control functions are considered our second line of defense and provide independent assessment, oversight and challenge of the risks taken by our first line of defense, as well as lead and participate in risk committees. Independent risk oversight and control functions include Compliance, Conflicts Resolution, Controllers, Legal, Risk and Tax.\nInternal Audit is considered our third line of defense and reports to the Audit Committee of the Board and administratively to our chief executive officer. Internal Audit includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. Internal Audit is responsible for independently assessing and validating the effectiveness of key controls, including those within the risk management framework, and providing timely reporting to the Audit Committee of the Board, senior management and regulators.\nThe three lines of defense structure promotes the accountability of first line risk takers, provides a framework for effective challenge by the second line and empowers independent review from the third line.\nProcesses.\nWe maintain various processes that are critical components of our risk management framework, including (i) risk identification and assessment, (ii) risk appetite, limit and threshold setting, (iii) risk reporting and monitoring, and (iv) risk decision-making.\nTo effectively assess our risks, we maintain a daily discipline of marking substantially all of our inventory to current market levels. We carry our inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues. We do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our inventory exposures.\nAn important part of our risk management process is firmwide stress testing. It allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks, highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions. Firmwide stress tests are performed on a regular basis and are designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity and funding, operational and compliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into a single combined scenario. We also perform ad hoc stress tests in anticipation of market events or conditions. Stress tests are also used to assess capital adequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing process. See “Equity Capital Management and Regulatory Capital — Equity Capital Management” for further information.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe Risk Governance Committee is responsible for approving limits at firmwide, business and product levels. Certain limits may be set at levels that will require periodic adjustment, rather than at levels that reflect our maximum risk appetite. This fosters an ongoing dialogue about risk among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management, as well as rapid escalation of\nrisk-related\nmatters. Additionally, through delegated authority from the Risk Governance Committee, Market Risk sets limits at certain product and desk levels, and Credit Risk sets limits for individual counterparties, counterparties and their subsidiaries, industries and countries. Limits are reviewed regularly and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changing market conditions, business conditions or risk tolerance.\nWe maintain strong and proactive communication about risk and we have a culture of collaboration in decision-making among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management. While our first line of defense is responsible for management of their risk, we dedicate extensive resources to our second line of defense in order to ensure a strong oversight structure and an appropriate segregation of duties. We regularly reinforce our strong culture of escalation and accountability across all functions.\nPeople.\nEven the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time about the risks we are taking. Ultimately, effective risk management requires our people to interpret our risk data on an ongoing and timely basis and adjust risk positions accordingly. The experience of our professionals, and their understanding of the nuances and limitations of each risk measure, guides us in assessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent levels.\nWe reinforce a culture of effective risk management, consistent with our risk appetite, in our training and development programs, as well as in the way we evaluate performance, and recognize and reward our people. Our training and development programs, including certain sessions led by our most senior leaders, are focused on the importance of risk management, client relationships and reputational excellence. As part of our performance review process, we assess reputational excellence, including how an employee exercises good risk management and reputational judgment, and adheres to our code of conduct and compliance policies. Our review and reward processes are designed to communicate and reinforce to our professionals the link between behavior and how people are recognized, the need to focus on our clients and our reputation, and the need to always act in accordance with our highest standards.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nStructure\nUltimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of our Board. The Board oversees risk both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee. We have a series of committees with specific risk management mandates that have oversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities. Committee membership generally consists of senior managers from both our first and second lines of defense. We have established procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information barriers are in place. Our primary risk committees, most of which also have additional\nsub-committees\nor working groups, are described below. In addition to these committees, we have other risk committees that provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products, regions and entities. All of our committees have responsibility for considering the impact of transactions and activities, which they oversee, on our reputation.\nMembership of our risk committees is reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the committee members. Accordingly, the length of time that members serve on the respective committees varies as determined by the committee chairs and based on the responsibilities of the members.\nThe chart below presents an overview of our risk management governance structure.\nManagement Committee.\nThe Management Committee oversees our global activities. It provides this oversight directly and through authority delegated to committees it has established. This committee consists of our most senior leaders, and is chaired by our chief executive officer. Most members of the Management Committee are also members of other committees. The following are the committees that are principally involved in firmwide risk management.\nFirmwide Enterprise Risk Committee.\nThe Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing all of our financial and nonfinancial risks. As a part of such oversight, the committee is responsible for the ongoing review, approval and monitoring of our enterprise risk management framework, as well as our risk limits framework. This committee is\nco-chaired\nby our chief financial officer and our chief risk officer, who are appointed as chairs by our chief executive officer, and reports to the Management Committee. The following are the primary committees that report to the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFirmwide Client and Business Standards Committee.\nThe Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee is responsible for overseeing relationships with our clients, client service and experience, and related business standards, as well as client-related reputational matters. This committee is chaired by our president and chief operating officer, who is appointed as chair by the chief executive officer, and reports to the Management Committee. This committee periodically provides updates to, and receives guidance from, the Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board.\nThe following committees report jointly to the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee and the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFirmwide Asset Liability Committee.\nThe Firmwide Asset Liability Committee reviews and approves the strategic direction for our financial resources, including capital, liquidity, funding and balance sheet. This committee has oversight responsibility for asset liability management, including interest rate and currency risk, funds transfer pricing, capital allocation and incentives, and credit ratings. This committee makes recommendations as to any adjustments to asset liability management and financial resource allocation in light of current events, risks, exposures, and regulatory requirements and approves related policies. This committee is\nco-chaired\nby our chief financial officer and our global treasurer, who are appointed as chairs by our chief executive officer, and reports to the Management Committee.\nConflicts Management\nConflicts of interest and our approach to dealing with them are fundamental to our client relationships, our reputation and our long-term success. The term “conflict of interest” does not have a universally accepted meaning, and conflicts can arise in many forms within a business or between businesses. The responsibility for identifying potential conflicts, as well as complying with our policies and procedures, is shared by all of our employees.\nWe have a multilayered approach to resolving conflicts and addressing reputational risk. Our senior management oversees policies related to conflicts resolution, and, in conjunction with Conflicts Resolution, Legal and Compliance, the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee, and other internal committees, formulates policies, standards and principles, and assists in making judgments regarding the appropriate resolution of particular conflicts. Resolving potential conflicts necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular situation and the application of experienced and informed judgment.\nAs a general matter, Conflicts Resolution reviews financing and advisory assignments in Investment Banking and certain of our investing, lending and other activities. In addition, we have various transaction oversight committees, such as the Firmwide Capital, Commitments and Suitability Committees and other committees that also review new underwritings, loans, investments and structured products. These groups and committees work with internal and external counsel and Compliance to evaluate and address any actual or potential conflicts. Conflicts Resolution reports to our president and chief operating officer.\nWe regularly assess our policies and procedures that address conflicts of interest in an effort to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.\nCompliance Risk Management\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to our reputation arising from our failure to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations, and our internal policies and procedures. Compliance risk is inherent in all activities through which we conduct our businesses. Our Compliance Risk Management Program, administered by Compliance, assesses our compliance, regulatory and reputational risk; monitors for compliance with new or amended laws, rules and regulations; designs and implements controls, policies, procedures and training; conducts independent testing; investigates, surveils and monitors for compliance risks and breaches; and leads our responses to regulatory examinations, audits and inquiries. We monitor and review business practices to assess whether they meet or exceed minimum regulatory and legal standards in all markets and jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nLiquidity Risk Management\nOverview\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund ourselves or meet our liquidity needs in the event of firm-specific, broader industry or market liquidity stress events. We have in place a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies. Our principal objective is to be able to fund ourselves and to enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues, even under adverse circumstances.\nTreasury, which reports to our chief financial officer, has primary responsibility for developing, managing and executing our liquidity and funding strategy within our risk appetite.\nLiquidity Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and Treasury, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our liquidity risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses and the establishment of stress testing and limits frameworks.\nLiquidity Risk Management Principles\nWe manage liquidity risk according to three principles: (i) hold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of GCLA to cover outflows during a stressed period, (ii) maintain appropriate Asset-Liability Management and (iii) maintain a viable Contingency Funding Plan.\nGCLA.\nGCLA is liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. A primary liquidity principle is to\npre-fund\nour estimated potential cash and collateral needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. We believe that the securities held in our GCLA would be readily convertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation, by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of resale agreements, and that this cash would allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets.\nOur GCLA reflects the following principles:\nWe maintain our GCLA across Group Inc., Goldman Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC) and Group Inc.’s major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, asset types and clearing agents to provide us with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets, even in a difficult funding environment. In addition to the GCLA, we maintain cash balances and securities in several of our other entities, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity.\nAsset-Liability Management.\nOur liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets experience persistent stress. We manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across markets, products and counterparties, and seek to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.\nOur approach to asset-liability management includes:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOur goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our assets and meet our contractual and contingent obligations in normal times, as well as during periods of market stress. Through our dynamic balance sheet management process, we use actual and projected asset balances to determine secured and unsecured funding requirements. Funding plans are reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee. In addition, our independent risk oversight and control functions analyze, and the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee reviews, our consolidated total capital position (unsecured long-term borrowings plus total shareholders’ equity) so that we maintain a level of long-term funding that is sufficient to meet our long-term financing requirements. In a liquidity crisis, we would first use our GCLA in order to avoid reliance on asset sales (other than our GCLA). However, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis.\nSubsidiary Funding Policies\nThe majority of our unsecured funding is raised by Group Inc., which provides the necessary funds to Funding IHC and other subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset financing, liquidity and capital requirements. In addition, Group Inc. provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. The benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries. Funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products, including deposits, secured funding and unsecured borrowings.\nOur intercompany funding policies assume that a subsidiary’s funds or securities are not freely available to its parent, Funding IHC or other subsidiaries unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. or Funding IHC. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations. Accordingly, we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC until the maturity of such financing.\nGroup Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries. For example, as of December 2020, Group Inc. had $34.54 billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in GS&Co., its principal U.S. registered broker-dealer; $42.12 billion invested in GSI, a regulated U.K. broker-dealer; $3.32 billion invested in GSJCL, a regulated Japanese broker-dealer; $34.30 billion invested in GS Bank USA, a regulated New York State-chartered bank; $4.13 billion invested in GSIB, a regulated U.K. bank; and $4.06 billion invested in GSBE, a regulated German bank. Group Inc. also provided, directly or indirectly, $111.96 billion of unsubordinated loans (including secured loans of $47.98 billion) and $16.65 billion of collateral and cash deposits to these entities, substantially all of which was to GS&Co., GSI and GSJCL, as of December 2020. In addition, as of December 2020, Group Inc. had significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries.\nContingency Funding Plan.\nWe maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress. Our contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation. The contingency funding plan also describes in detail our potential responses if our assessments indicate that we have entered a liquidity crisis, which include\npre-funding\nfor what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs, as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity. Mitigants and action items to address specific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution.\nThe contingency funding plan identifies key groups of individuals and their responsibilities, which include fostering effective coordination, control and distribution of information, implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managing internal and external communication, all of which are critical in the management of a crisis or period of market stress.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nStress Tests\nIn order to determine the appropriate size of our GCLA, we model liquidity outflows over a range of scenarios and time horizons. One of our primary internal liquidity risk models, referred to as the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, quantifies our liquidity risks over a\n30-day\nstress scenario. We also consider other factors, including, but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs through an additional internal liquidity risk model, referred to as the Intraday Liquidity Model, the results of our long-term stress testing models, our resolution liquidity models and other applicable regulatory requirements and a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets. The results of the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, the Intraday Liquidity Model, the long-term stress testing models and the resolution liquidity models are reported to senior management on a regular basis. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about firmwide stress tests.\nModeled Liquidity Outflow.\nOur Modeled Liquidity Outflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios that include combinations of market-wide and firm-specific stress. These scenarios are characterized by the following qualitative elements:\nThe following are key modeling elements of our Modeled Liquidity Outflow:\nIntraday Liquidity Model.\nOur Intraday Liquidity Model measures our intraday liquidity needs using a scenario analysis characterized by the same qualitative elements as our Modeled Liquidity Outflow. The model assesses the risk of increased intraday liquidity requirements during a scenario where access to sources of intraday liquidity may become constrained.\nLong-Term Stress Testing.\nWe utilize longer-term stress tests to take a forward view on our liquidity position through prolonged stress periods in which we experience a severe liquidity stress and recover in an environment that continues to be challenging. We are focused on ensuring conservative asset-liability management to prepare for a prolonged period of potential stress, seeking to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets.\nResolution Liquidity Models.\nIn connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established our Resolution Liquidity Adequacy and Positioning framework, which estimates liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a stressed environment. The liquidity needs are measured using our Modeled Liquidity Outflow assumptions and include certain additional inter-affiliate exposures. We have also established our Resolution Liquidity Execution Need framework, which measures the liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries to stabilize and wind-down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy.\nIn addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the Board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.\nLimits\nWe use liquidity risk limits at various levels and across liquidity risk types to manage the size of our liquidity exposures. Limits are measured relative to acceptable levels of risk given our liquidity risk tolerance. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about the limit approval process.\nLimits are monitored by Treasury and Liquidity Risk. Liquidity Risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nGCLA and Unencumbered Metrics\nGCLA.\nBased on the results of our internal liquidity risk models, described above, as well as our consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to, a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets, we believe our liquidity position as of both December 2020 and December 2019 was appropriate. We strictly limit our GCLA to a narrowly defined list of securities and cash because they are highly liquid, even in a difficult funding environment. We do not include other potential sources of excess liquidity in our GCLA, such as less liquid unencumbered securities or committed credit facilities.\nThe table below presents information about our GCLA.\nIn the table above:\nWe maintain our GCLA to enable us to meet current and potential liquidity requirements of our parent company, Group Inc., and its subsidiaries. Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model incorporate a requirement for Group Inc., as well as a standalone requirement for each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. Funding IHC is required to provide the necessary liquidity to Group Inc. during the ordinary course of business, and is also obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to major subsidiaries in the event of our material financial distress or failure. Liquidity held directly in each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In addition, the Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model also incorporate a broader assessment of standalone liquidity requirements for other subsidiaries and we hold a portion of our GCLA directly at Group Inc. or Funding IHC to support such requirements.\nOther Unencumbered Assets.\nIn addition to our GCLA, we have a significant amount of other unencumbered cash and financial instruments, including other government obligations, high-grade money market securities, corporate obligations, marginable equities, loans and cash deposits not included in our GCLA. The fair value of our unencumbered assets averaged $214.06 billion for the three months ended December 2020, $206.01 billion for the three months ended December 2019, $207.60 billion for the year ended December 2020 and $202.03 billion for the year ended December 2019. We do not consider these assets liquid enough to be eligible for our GCLA.\nLiquidity Regulatory Framework\nAs a BHC, we are subject to a minimum Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. The LCR rule requires organizations to maintain an adequate ratio of eligible high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to expected net cash outflows under an acute short-term liquidity stress scenario. Eligible HQLA excludes HQLA held by subsidiaries that is in excess of their minimum requirement and is subject to transfer restrictions. We are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. We expect that fluctuations in client activity, business mix and the market environment will impact our LCR.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below presents information about our average daily LCR.\nIn October 2020, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that establishes a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) requirement for large U.S. banking organizations. This rule will become effective on July 1, 2021 and requires banking organizations to ensure they have access to stable funding over a\none-year\ntime horizon. The rule also requires disclosure of the ratio on a semi-annual basis and a description of the banking organization’s stable funding sources beginning in 2023.\nThe following provides information about our subsidiary liquidity regulatory requirements:\nThe implementation of these rules and any amendments adopted by the regulatory authorities could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future.\nCredit Ratings\nWe rely on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our\nday-to-day\noperations and the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. Credit ratings are also important when we are competing in certain markets, such as OTC derivatives, and when we seek to engage in longer-term transactions. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this\nForm 10-K\nfor information about the risks associated with a reduction in our credit ratings.\nThe table below presents the unsecured credit ratings and outlook of Group Inc.\nIn the table above:\nIn January 2021, Moody’s upgraded Group Inc.’s long-term debt ratings (from A3 to A2) and short-term debt ratings (from\nP-2\nto\nP-1),\nand has returned the outlook from ratings under review to stable.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below presents the unsecured credit ratings and outlook of GS Bank USA, GSIB, GSBE, GS&Co. and GSI.\nWe believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies’ assessment of:\nCertain of our derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. We manage our GCLA to ensure we would, among other potential requirements, be able to make the additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a\ntwo-notch\nreduction in our long-term credit ratings, as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them.\nSee Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about derivatives with credit-related contingent features and the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a\none-\nor\ntwo-notch\ndowngrade in our credit ratings.\nCash Flows\nAs a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets. Consequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the liquidity and asset-liability management policies described above. Cash flow analysis may, however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our businesses.\nYear Ended December 2020.\nOur cash and cash equivalents increased by $22.30 billion to $155.84 billion at the end of 2020, primarily due to net cash provided by financing activities, partially offset by net cash used for investing activities and operating activities. The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected an increase in net deposits, reflecting increases in consumer, transaction banking and private bank deposits. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected an increase in net purchases of investments, reflecting an increase in U.S. government obligations accounted for as\navailable-for-sale\nand an increase in net lending activities. The net cash used for operating activities primarily reflected an increase in trading assets, net customer and other receivables and payables, and collateralized transactions (an increase in collateralized agreements, partially offset by an increase in collateralized financings), partially offset by an increase in trading liabilities as a result of our and our clients’ activities.\nYear Ended December 2019.\nOur cash and cash equivalents increased by $3.00 billion to $133.55 billion at the end of 2019, primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities and financing activities, partially offset by net cash used for investing activities. The net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected cash provided by collateralized transactions (a decrease in collateralized agreements and an increase in collateralized financings) as a result of our and our clients’ activities, partially offset by an increase in trading assets, as a result of client activity. The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected an increase in consumer deposits, partially offset by net repayments of unsecured long-term borrowings and common stock repurchases. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected net purchases of investments and an increase in loans.\nFor an analysis of cash flows for the year ended December 2018, see Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nMarket Risk Management\nOverview\nMarket risk is the risk of loss in the value of our inventory, investments, loans and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value due to changes in market conditions. We hold such positions primarily for market making for our clients and for our investing and financing activities, and therefore, these positions change based on client demands and our investment opportunities. Since these positions are accounted for at fair value, they fluctuate on a daily basis, with the related gains and losses included in the consolidated statements of earnings. We employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections below, to monitor market risk. Categories of market risk include the following:\nMarket Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our market risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses.\nManagers in revenue-producing units and Market Risk discuss market information, positions and estimated loss scenarios on an ongoing basis. Managers in revenue-producing units are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits. These managers have\nin-depth\nknowledge of their positions, markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures.\nMarket Risk Management Process\nOur process for managing market risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” as well as the following:\nOur market risk management systems enable us to perform an independent calculation of VaR and stress measures, capture risk measures at individual position levels, attribute risk measures to individual risk factors of each position, report many different views of the risk measures (e.g., by desk, business, product type or entity) and produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner.\nRisk Measures\nWe produce risk measures and monitor them against established market risk limits. These measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at product, business and firmwide levels.\nWe use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short- and long-term time horizons. Our primary risk measures are VaR, which is used for shorter-term periods, and stress tests. Our risk reports detail key risks, drivers and changes for each desk and business, and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenue-producing units and our independent risk oversight and control functions.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nValue-at-Risk.\nVaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. For assets and liabilities included in VaR, see “Financial Statement Linkages to Market Risk Measures.” We typically employ a\none-day\ntime horizon with a 95% confidence level. We use a single VaR model, which captures risks, including interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. As such, VaR facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level.\nWe are aware of the inherent limitations to VaR and therefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk management process. Inherent limitations to VaR include:\nTo comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant risks in our VaR calculation, we use historical simulations with full valuation of market factors at the position level by simultaneously shocking the relevant market factors for that position. These market factors include spot prices, credit spreads, funding spreads, yield curves, volatility and correlation, and are updated periodically based on changes in the composition of positions, as well as variations in market conditions. We sample from five years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our VaR calculation. The historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time. This gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities, which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss. As a result, even if our positions included in VaR were unchanged, our VaR would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa.\nGiven its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions.\nOur VaR measure does not include:\nWe perform daily backtesting of our VaR model (i.e., comparing daily net revenues for positions included in VaR to the VaR measure calculated as of the prior business day) at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries.\nStress Testing.\nStress testing is a method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios. We use stress testing to examine risks of specific portfolios, as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures. We use a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios, including firmwide stress tests, sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. The results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management purposes. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about firmwide stress tests.\nSensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market shocks, ranging from those that could be expected over a\none-day\ntime horizon up to those that could take many months to occur. We also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity, which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures.\nScenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event, including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. For example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign positions, as well as the corresponding debt, equity and currency exposures associated with our\nnon-sovereign\npositions that may be impacted by the sovereign distress. When conducting scenario analysis, we often consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario, ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts. In addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios.\nUnlike VaR measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level, there may not be an implied probability that our stress testing scenarios will occur. Instead, stress testing is used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors. When estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so).\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nLimits\nWe use market risk limits at various levels to manage the size of our market exposures. These limits are set based on VaR and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about the limit approval process.\nMarket Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded (e.g., due to positional changes or changes in market conditions, such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations). Such instances are remediated by a reduction in the positions we hold and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the limit.\nMetrics\nWe analyze VaR at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels, including by risk category, business and region. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated.\nThe table below presents our average daily VaR.\nOur average daily VaR increased to $94 million in 2020 from $56 million in 2019, due to increases in the equity prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices categories, partially offset by an increase in the diversification effect. The overall increase was primarily due to higher levels of volatility.\nThe table below presents our\nperiod-end\nVaR.\nOur\nperiod-end\nVaR increased to $91 million as of December 2020 from $70 million as of December 2019, due to increases in the interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices categories, partially offset by an increase in the diversification effect. The overall increase was primarily due to increased exposures.\nDuring 2020, the firmwide VaR risk limit was exceeded on 16 occasions (all of which occurred during the first half of 2020), primarily due to higher levels of volatility. There were no permanent changes to the firmwide VaR risk limit during this period. However, there were temporary increases to the firmwide VaR risk limit as a result of the market environment. During 2019, the firmwide VaR risk limit was not exceeded, raised or reduced.\nThe table below presents our high and low VaR.\nThe chart below presents our daily VaR for 2020.\nThe table below presents, by number of business days, the frequency distribution of our daily net revenues for positions included in VaR.\nDaily net revenues for positions included in VaR are compared with VaR calculated as of the end of the prior business day. Net losses incurred on a single day for such positions exceeded our 95%\none-day\nVaR (i.e., a VaR exception) on two occasions during 2020 and did not exceed our 95%\none-day\nVaR during 2019.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nDuring periods in which we have significantly more positive net revenue days than net revenue loss days, we expect to have fewer VaR exceptions because, under normal conditions, our business model generally produces positive net revenues. In periods in which our franchise revenues are adversely affected, we generally have more loss days, resulting in more VaR exceptions. The daily net revenues for positions included in VaR used to determine VaR exceptions reflect the impact of any intraday activity, including bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature.\nSensitivity Measures\nCertain portfolios and individual positions are not included in VaR because VaR is not the most appropriate risk measure. Other sensitivity measures we use to analyze market risk are described below.\n10% Sensitivity Measures.\nThe table below presents our market risk by asset category for positions accounted for at fair value, that are not included in VaR.\nIn the table above:\nCredit and Funding Spread Sensitivity on Derivatives and Financial Liabilities.\nVaR excludes the impact of changes in counterparty credit spreads, our own credit spreads and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads (debt valuation adjustment) on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. The estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads (counterparty and our own) and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives (including hedges) was a loss of $3 million as of December 2020 and $2 million as of December 2019. In addition, the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected was a gain of $22 million as of December 2020 and $29 million as of December 2019. However, the actual net impact of a change in our own credit spreads is also affected by the liquidity, duration and convexity (as the sensitivity is not linear to changes in yields) of those financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected, as well as the relative performance of any hedges undertaken.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity.\nLoans accounted for at amortized cost were $99.69 billion as of December 2020 and $89.20 billion as of December 2019, substantially all of which had floating interest rates. The estimated sensitivity to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on such loans was $737 million as of December 2020 and $681 million as of December 2019 of additional interest income over a twelve-month period, which does not take into account the potential impact of an increase in costs to fund such loans. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about loans accounted for at amortized cost.\nOther Market Risk Considerations\nWe make investments in securities that are accounted for as\navailable-for-sale,\nheld-to-maturity\nor under the equity method which are included in investments in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nDirect investments in real estate are accounted for at cost less accumulated depreciation. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about other assets.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nFinancial Statement Linkages to Market Risk Measures\nWe employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections above, to monitor market risk across the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of earnings. The related gains and losses on these positions are included in market making, other principal transactions, interest income and interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings, and debt valuation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nThe table below presents certain assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and the market risk measures used to assess those assets and liabilities.\nCredit Risk Management\nOverview\nCredit risk represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty (e.g., an OTC derivatives counterparty or a borrower) or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold. Our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in OTC derivatives and loans and lending commitments. Credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks, securities financing transactions (i.e., resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities) and customer and other receivables.\nCredit Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our credit risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses. In addition, we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk (e.g., bonds and secondary bank loans). These credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures, which are monitored and managed by Market Risk. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. Such derivatives also give rise to credit risk, which is monitored and managed by Credit Risk.\nCredit Risk Management Process\nOur process for managing credit risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” as well as the following:\nWe also perform credit reviews, which include initial and ongoing analyses of our counterparties. For substantially all of our credit exposures, the core of our process is an annual counterparty credit review. A credit review is an independent analysis of the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations, resulting in an internal credit rating. The determination of internal credit ratings also incorporates assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the counterparty’s industry, and the economic environment. Senior personnel, with expertise in specific industries, inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings.\nOur risk assessment process may also include, where applicable, reviewing certain key metrics, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, collateral values, FICO credit scores and other risk factors.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nOur credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries. These systems also provide management with comprehensive information about our aggregate credit risk by product, internal credit rating, industry, country and region.\nRisk Measures\nWe measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of\nnon-payment\nby a counterparty using current and potential exposure. For derivatives and securities financing transactions, current exposure represents the amount presently owed to us after taking into account applicable netting and collateral arrangements, while potential exposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level. Potential exposure also takes into account netting and collateral arrangements. For loans and lending commitments, the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position.\nStress Tests\nWe conduct regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity prices). These shocks cover a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements, including shocks to multiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event. In the case of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the default, and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default. Unlike potential exposure, which is calculated within a specified confidence level, stress testing does not generally assume a probability of these events occurring. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about firmwide stress tests.\nTo supplement these regular stress tests, as described above, we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market events that we deem significant. We also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above. The parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test. We review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude, highlight potential loss concentrations, and assess and mitigate our exposures where necessary.\nLimits\nWe use credit risk limits at various levels, as well as underwriting standards to manage the size and nature of our credit exposures. Limits for industries and countries are based on our risk appetite and are designed to allow for regular monitoring, review, escalation and management of credit risk concentrations. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about the limit approval process.\nCredit Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded.\nRisk Mitigants\nTo reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. We may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the counterparty’s credit rating falls below a specified level. We monitor the fair value of the collateral to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized. We seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive.\nFor loans and lending commitments, depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction, we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk mitigants include collateral provisions, guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, for certain lending commitments, provisions in the legal documentation that allow us to adjust loan amounts, pricing, structure and other terms as market conditions change. The type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan or lending commitment.\nWhen we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterparty’s financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent, we may obtain third-party guarantees of the counterparty’s obligations. We may also mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nCredit Exposures\nAs of December 2020, our aggregate credit exposure increased as compared with December 2019, primarily reflecting increases in cash deposits with central banks and OTC derivatives. The percentage of our credit exposures arising from\nnon-investment-grade\ncounterparties (based on our internally determined public rating agency equivalents) increased as compared with December 2019, primarily reflecting an increase in\nnon-investment-grade\ncredit exposure related to OTC derivatives and loans and lending commitments. Our credit exposure to counterparties that defaulted during 2020 was higher as compared with our credit exposure to counterparties that defaulted during 2019, and such exposure was primarily related to loans and lending commitments. Our credit exposure to counterparties that defaulted during 2020 remained low, representing approximately 1% of our total credit exposure. Estimated losses associated with these defaults have been recognized in earnings. Our credit exposures are described further below.\nCash and Cash Equivalents.\nOur credit exposure on cash and cash equivalents arises from our unrestricted cash, and includes both interest-bearing and\nnon-interest-bearing\ndeposits. To mitigate the risk of credit loss, we place substantially all of our deposits with highly rated banks and central banks.\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.\nThe table above excludes cash segregated for regulatory and other purposes of $24.52 billion as of December 2020 and $22.78 billion as of December 2019.\nOTC Derivatives.\nOur credit exposure on OTC derivatives arises primarily from our market-making activities. As a market maker, we enter into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. We manage our credit exposure on OTC derivatives using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above.\nWe generally enter into OTC derivatives transactions under bilateral collateral arrangements that require the daily exchange of collateral. As credit risk is an essential component of fair value, we include a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk, as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. CVA is a function of the present value of expected exposure, the probability of counterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default.\nThe table below presents our net credit exposure from OTC derivatives and the concentration by industry and region.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below presents the distribution of our net credit exposure from OTC derivatives by tenor.\nIn the table above:\nThe tables below present the distribution of our net credit exposure from OTC derivatives by tenor and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.\nLending Activities.\nWe manage our lending activities using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above. Other lending positions, including secondary trading positions, are risk-managed as a component of market risk.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we conformed the classification of our lending portfolio with Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements. Prior period amounts have been conformed to the current presentation.\nThe table below presents our loans and lending commitments.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nCorporate.\nCorporate loans and lending commitments include term loans, revolving lines of credit, letter of credit facilities and bridge loans, and are principally used for operating and general corporate purposes, or in connection with acquisitions. Corporate loans may be secured or unsecured, depending on the loan purpose, the risk profile of the borrower and other factors.\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from corporate loans and lending commitments, and the concentration by industry, region, internally determined public rating agency equivalents and other credit metrics.\nIn the table above, credit exposure excludes $3.20 billion as of December 2020 and $4.10 billion as of December 2019 relating to issued letters of credit which are classified as guarantees in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about guarantees.\nWealth Management.\nWealth management loans and lending commitments are extended to private bank clients, including wealth management and other clients. These loans are used to finance investments in both financial and nonfinancial assets, bridge cash flow timing gaps or provide liquidity for other needs. Substantially all of such loans are secured by securities, residential real estate, commercial real estate or other assets.\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from wealth management loans and lending commitments, and the concentration by region, internally determined public rating agency equivalents and other credit metrics.\nIn the table above, other/unrated loans primarily include loans backed by residential real estate. Our risk assessment process for such loans include reviewing certain key metrics, such as\nloan-to-value\nratio and delinquency status.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nCommercial Real Estate.\nCommercial real estate loans and lending commitments include originated loans and lending commitments (other than those extended to private bank clients) that are directly or indirectly secured by hotels, retail stores, multifamily housing complexes and commercial and industrial properties. Commercial real estate loans and lending commitments also includes loans and lending commitments extended to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly backed by commercial real estate. In addition, commercial real estate includes loans purchased by us.\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from commercial real estate loans and lending commitments, and the concentration by region, internally determined public rating agency equivalents and other credit metrics.\nIn the table above, credit exposure includes loans and lending commitments of $7.88 billion as of December 2020 and $5.41 billion as of December 2019 which are extended to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly backed by commercial real estate.\nIn addition, we also have credit exposure to certain commercial real estate loans held for securitization of $503 million as of December 2020 and $1.55 billion as of December 2019. Such loans are included in trading assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nResidential Real Estate.\nResidential real estate loans and lending commitments are extended to clients (other than those extended to private bank clients) who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly secured by residential real estate and also includes loans purchased by us.\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from residential real estate loans and lending commitments, and the concentration by region, internally determined public rating agency equivalents and other credit metrics.\nIn the table above:\nIn addition, we also have exposure to residential real estate loans held for securitization of $5.57 billion as of December 2020 and $4.70 billion as of December 2019. Such loans are included in trading assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nInstallment and Credit Card Lending.\nWe originate unsecured installment loans and credit card loans (pursuant to revolving lines of credit) to consumers in the Americas. The credit card lines are cancellable by us and therefore do not result in credit exposure.\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from originated installment and credit card funded loans, and the concentration by the five most concentrated U.S. states.\nSee Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the credit quality indicators of installment and credit card loans.\nOther.\nOther loans and lending commitments are extended to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly secured by consumer loans, including auto loans and private student loans. Other loans also includes unsecured consumer and credit card loans purchased by us.\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from other loans and lending commitments, and the concentration by region internally determined public rating agency equivalents and other credit metrics.\nIn the table above:\nIn addition, we also have exposure to other loans held for securitization of $420 million as of December 2020 and $347 million as of December 2019. Such loans are included in trading assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nCredit Hedges\nTo mitigate the credit risk associated with our lending activities, we obtain credit protection on certain loans and lending commitments through credit default swaps, both single-name and index-based contracts, and through the issuance of credit-linked notes. In addition, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. provides us with credit loss protection on certain approved loan commitments.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nSecurities Financing Transactions.\nWe enter into securities financing transactions in order to, among other things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain activities. We bear credit risk related to resale agreements and securities borrowed only to the extent that cash advanced or the value of securities pledged or delivered to the counterparty exceeds the value of the collateral received. We also have credit exposure on repurchase agreements and securities loaned to the extent that the value of securities pledged or delivered to the counterparty for these transactions exceeds the amount of cash or collateral received. Securities collateral for these transactions primarily includes U.S. and\nnon-U.S.\ngovernment and agency obligations.\nThe table below presents our credit exposure from securities financing transactions and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.\nThe table above reflects both netting agreements and collateral that we consider when determining credit risk.\nOther Credit Exposures.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from our receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and customers and counterparties. Receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations primarily consist of initial margin placed with clearing organizations and receivables related to sales of securities which have traded, but not yet settled. These receivables generally have minimal credit risk due to the low probability of clearing organization default and the short-term nature of receivables related to securities settlements. Receivables from customers and counterparties generally consist of collateralized receivables related to customer securities transactions and generally have minimal credit risk due to both the value of the collateral received and the short-term nature of these receivables.\nThe table below presents our other credit exposures and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.\nThe table above reflects collateral that we consider when determining credit risk.\nSelected Exposures\nWe have credit and market exposures, as described below, that have had heightened focus given recent events and broad market concerns. Credit exposure represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty or borrower. Market exposure represents the potential for loss in value of our long and short positions due to changes in market prices.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nCountry Exposures.\nLiquidity pressures prompted the Argentine government to default and restructure local and foreign obligations in 2020. Economic challenges persist and the country still needs to secure new financial terms with the IMF. As of December 2020, our total credit exposure to Argentina was $164 million, which was with\nnon-sovereign\ncounterparties or borrowers, and was primarily related to loans and lending commitments. Our total market exposure to Argentina as of December 2020 was not material.\nThe restructuring of Lebanon’s sovereign debt and sharp currency depreciation have led to concerns about its financial and political stability. As of December 2020, our total credit exposure to Lebanon was $196 million, all of which related to loans and lending commitments with\nnon-sovereign\nborrowers. Our total market exposure to Lebanon as of December 2020 was not material.\nZambia’s sovereign debt default and ongoing liquidity pressures aggravated by the\nCOVID-19\npandemic have led to concerns about Zambia’s financial stability. As of December 2020, our total credit and market exposure for Zambia was not material.\nVenezuela has delayed payments on its sovereign debt and its political situation remains unclear. As of December 2020, our total credit and market exposure for Venezuela was not material.\nWe have a comprehensive framework to monitor, measure and assess our country exposures and to determine our risk appetite. We determine the country of risk by the location of the counterparty, issuer or underlier’s assets, where they generate revenue, the country in which they are headquartered, the jurisdiction where a claim against them could be enforced, and/or the government whose policies affect their ability to repay their obligations. We monitor our credit exposure to a specific country both at the individual counterparty level, as well as at the aggregate country level. See “Stress Tests” for information about stress tests that are designed to estimate the direct and indirect impact of events involving the above countries.\nIndustry Exposures.\nThe decline in oil prices has led to market concerns regarding the creditworthiness of certain companies in the oil and gas industry. As of December 2020, our credit exposure to oil and gas companies related to loans and lending commitments was $11.30 billion ($2.98 billion of loans and $8.32 billion of lending commitments). Such exposure included $4.96 billion of exposure to\nnon-investment-grade\ncounterparties ($2.11 billion related to loans and $2.85 billion related to lending commitments), of which 76% was secured. In addition, we have exposure to our clients in the oil and gas industry arising from derivatives. As of December 2020, our credit exposure related to derivatives and receivables with oil and gas companies was $2.22 billion ($455 million with investment-grade counterparties and $1.77 billion with\nnon-investment-grade\ncounterparties). After taking into consideration the benefit of $800 million of hedges, our net credit exposure was $12.72 billion. As of December 2020, our market exposure related to oil and gas companies was $(1.37) billion, which was primarily to investment-grade issuers or underliers. Such exposure consisted of $317 million related to debt, $(1.71) billion related to credit derivatives and $24 million related to equities.\nThe sharp decline in economic activity as a result of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic has resulted in a significant impact to the gaming and lodging industry. As of December 2020, our credit exposure to gaming and lodging companies (including hotel owners and operators) related to loans and lending commitments was $2.14 billion ($863 million of loans and $1.28 billion of lending commitments). Such exposure included $1.69 billion of exposure to\nnon-investment-grade\ncounterparties ($709 million related to loans and $977 million related to lending commitments), of which 84% was secured. In addition, we extend loans that are secured by hotel properties. As of December 2020, our exposure related to such loans and lending commitments was $1.31 billion and was to\nnon-investment-grade\ncounterparties. In addition, we have exposure to our clients in the gaming and lodging industry arising from derivatives. As of December 2020, our credit exposure related to derivatives and receivables with gaming and lodging companies was $232 million, with\nnon-investment-grade\ncounterparties. As of December 2020, our market exposure related to gaming and lodging companies was $95 million, which was primarily to\nnon-investment-grade\nissuers or underliers. Such exposure consisted of $103 million related to debt, $(175) million related to credit derivatives and $167 million related to equities.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nConcerns surrounding the\nCOVID-19\npandemic have resulted in a sharp decline in travel which has significantly impacted the airline industry. As of December 2020, our credit exposure to airline companies related to loans and lending commitments was $1.54 billion ($1.12 billion of loans and $416 million of lending commitments) to\nnon-investment-grade\ncounterparties, of which 84% was secured. In addition, we have exposure to our clients in the airline industry arising from derivatives. As of December 2020, our credit exposure related to derivatives and receivables with airline companies was $401 million ($152 million with investment-grade counterparties and $249 million with\nnon-investment-grade\ncounterparties). After taking into consideration the benefit of $278 million of hedges, our net credit exposure was $1.66 billion. As of December 2020, our market exposure related to airline companies was $(210) million, which was substantially all to\nnon-investment-grade\nissuers or underliers. Such exposure consisted of $114 million related to debt, $(307) million related to credit derivatives and $(17) million related to equities.\nOperational Risk Management\nOverview\nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. Our exposure to operational risk arises from routine processing errors, as well as extraordinary incidents, such as major systems failures or legal and regulatory matters.\nPotential types of loss events related to internal and external operational risk include:\nOperational Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for developing and implementing a formalized framework for assessing, monitoring and managing operational risk with the goal of maintaining our exposure to operational risk at levels that are within our risk appetite.\nOperational Risk Management Process\nOur process for managing operational risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” including a comprehensive data collection process, as well as firmwide policies and procedures, for operational risk events.\nWe combine\ntop-down\nand\nbottom-up\napproaches to manage and measure operational risk. From a\ntop-down\nperspective, our senior management assesses firmwide and business-level operational risk profiles. From a\nbottom-up\nperspective, our first and second lines of defense are responsible for risk identification and risk management on a\nday-to-day\nbasis, including escalating operational risks to senior management.\nWe maintain a comprehensive control framework designed to provide a well-controlled environment to minimize operational risks. The Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee is responsible for overseeing operational risk, and for ensuring our business and operational resilience.\nOur operational risk management framework is in part designed to comply with the operational risk measurement rules under the Capital Framework and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance.\nWe have established policies that require all employees to report and escalate operational risk events. When operational risk events are identified, our policies require that the events be documented and analyzed to determine whether changes are required in our systems and/or processes to further mitigate the risk of future events.\nWe use operational risk management applications to capture and organize operational risk event data and key metrics. One of our key risk identification and assessment tools is an operational risk and control self-assessment process, which is performed by our managers. This process consists of the identification and rating of operational risks, on a forward-looking basis, and the related controls. The results from this process are analyzed to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses, activities or products with heightened levels of operational risk.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nRisk Measurement\nWe measure our operational risk exposure using both statistical modeling and scenario analyses, which involve qualitative and quantitative assessments of internal and external operational risk event data and internal control factors for each of our businesses. Operational risk measurement also incorporates an assessment of business environment factors, including:\nThe results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that may have heightened exposure to operational risk. These analyses are used in the determination of the appropriate level of operational risk capital to hold. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about firmwide stress tests.\nTypes of Operational Risks\nIncreased reliance on technology and third-party relationships has resulted in increased operational risks, such as information and cyber security risk, third-party risk and business resilience risk. We manage those risks as follows:\nInformation and Cyber Security Risk.\nInformation and cyber security risk is the risk of compromising the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our data and systems, leading to an adverse impact to us, our reputation, our clients and/or the broader financial system. We seek to minimize the occurrence and impact of unauthorized access, disruption or use of information and/or information systems. We deploy and operate preventive and detective controls and processes to mitigate emerging and evolving information security and cyber security threats, including monitoring our network for known vulnerabilities and signs of unauthorized attempts to access our data and systems. There is increased information risk through diversification of our data across external service providers, including use of a variety of cloud-provided or -hosted services and applications. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this\nForm 10-K\nfor further information about information and cyber security risk.\nThird-Party Risk.\nThird-party risk, including vendor risk, is the risk of an adverse impact due to reliance on third parties performing services or activities on our behalf. These risks may include legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, operational or any other risks inherent in engaging a third party. We identify, manage and report key third-party risks and conduct due diligence across multiple risk domains, including information security and cyber security, resilience and additional third-party dependencies. The Third-Party Risk Program monitors, reviews and reassesses third-party risks on an ongoing basis. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this\nForm 10-K\nfor further information about third-party risk.\nBusiness Resilience Risk.\nBusiness resilience risk is the risk of disruption to our critical processes. We monitor threats and assess risks and seek to ensure our state of readiness in the event of a significant operational disruption to the normal operations of our critical functions or their dependencies, such as critical facilities, systems, third parties, data and/or personnel. We approach BCP through the lens of business and operational resilience. The resilience framework defines the fundamental principles for BCP and crisis management to ensure that critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption. The business continuity program is comprehensive, consistent firmwide and\nup-to-date,\nincorporating new information, techniques and technologies as and when they become available, and our resilience recovery plans incorporate and test specific and measurable recovery time objectives in accordance with local market best practices and regulatory requirements, and under specific scenarios. See “Regulatory and Other Matters — Other Matters” for information about the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic. See “Business — Business Continuity and Information Security” in Part I, Item 1 of this\nForm 10-K\nfor further information about business continuity.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nModel Risk Management\nOverview\nModel risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions made based on model outputs that may be incorrect or used inappropriately. We rely on quantitative models across our business activities primarily to value certain financial assets and liabilities, to monitor and manage our risk, and to measure and monitor our regulatory capital.\nModel Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units, model developers, model owners and model users, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our model risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses, and provides periodic updates to senior management, risk committees and the Risk Committee of the Board.\nOur model risk management framework is managed through a governance structure and risk management controls, which encompass standards designed to ensure we maintain a comprehensive model inventory, including risk assessment and classification, sound model development practices, independent review and model-specific usage controls. The Firmwide Model Risk Control Committee oversees our model risk management framework.\nModel Review and Validation Process\nModel Risk consists of quantitative professionals who perform an independent review, validation and approval of our models. This review includes an analysis of the model documentation, independent testing, an assessment of the appropriateness of the methodology used, and verification of compliance with model development and implementation standards.\nWe regularly refine and enhance our models to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and our business mix. All models are reviewed on an annual basis, and new models or significant changes to existing models and their assumptions are approved prior to implementation.\nThe model validation process incorporates a review of models and trade and risk parameters across a broad range of scenarios (including extreme conditions) in order to critically evaluate and verify:\nSee “Critical Accounting Policies — Fair Value — Review of Valuation Models,” “Liquidity Risk Management,” “Market Risk Management,” “Credit Risk Management” and “Operational Risk Management” for further information about our use of models within these areas.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

    "text": "Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the firm), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The firm’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the firm’s principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the firm’s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nAs of December 31, 2020, management conducted an assessment of the firm’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in\nInternal\nControl — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 was effective.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the firm; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the firm’s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nThe firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on pages 113 to 115, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the firm’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.:\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control\n—\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing on page 112. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\nAs described in Notes 4 through 10 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2020, the Company carries financial instruments at fair value, which includes $26.3 billion of financial assets and $32.9 billion of financial liabilities classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as one or more inputs to the financial instrument’s valuation technique are significant and unobservable. Significant unobservable inputs used by management to value certain of these Level 3 financial instruments included (i) industry multiples and public comparables, (ii) credit spreads\nand (iii) correlation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain Level 3 financial instruments\nis a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in valuing the financial instruments, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures related to the valuation of certain Level 3 financial instruments, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment and effort to evaluate the audit evidence obtained related to the aforementioned significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of certain Level 3 financial instruments, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of financial instruments, including controls over the methods and significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of certain Level 3 financial instruments.\nThese procedures also included, among others, for a sample of financial instruments, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in (i) developing an independent estimate of fair value or (ii) testing management’s process to determine the fair value of these financial instruments. Developing the independent estimate involved (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management, (ii) evaluating and utilizing management’s significant unobservable inputs or developing independent significant unobservable inputs, and (iii) comparing management’s estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value. Testing management’s process included evaluating the reasonableness of the aforementioned significant unobservable inputs, evaluating the appropriateness of the methods used, and testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management to determine the fair value of these instruments.\nAllowance for Loan Losses — Wholesale Loan Portfolio\nAs described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s allowance for loan losses related to wholesale loans reflects management’s estimate of loan losses over the remaining expected life of the loans and also considers forecasts of future economic conditions. As of December 31, 2020, $2.6 billion of the allowance for loan losses and $95.5 billion of the loans accounted for at amortized cost related to the wholesale loan portfolio. The allowance for wholesale loan losses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. In addition, it includes qualitative components to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk. The wholesale models determine the probability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors, including internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators, the borrower’s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower’s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for wholesale loans include forecasted U.S. unemployment rates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and industrial delinquency rates, short- and long-term interest rates, and oil prices.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in the determinations of internal credit ratings and the forecasted U.S. unemployment rates, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s determinations, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio, including controls over the model, certain data, and significant assumptions.\nThese procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating the allowance for loan losses for wholesale loans using a modeled approach, which involved evaluating the appropriateness of the model and methodology and testing the completeness and accuracy of certain data used in estimating the allowance for loan losses. The procedures also included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the model and methodology and (ii) the reasonableness of the internal credit ratings and the forecasted U.S. unemployment rates used in estimating the allowance for wholesale loan losses.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 19, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1922.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The firm also provides loans and accepts deposits through its consumer banking digital platform,\nMarcus by Goldman Sachs\n,\nand through its private bank, as well as issues credit cards to consumers.\nNote 2.\nBasis of Presentation\nThese consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of Group Inc. and all other entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nAll references to 2020, 2019 and 2018 refer to the firm’s years ended, or the dates, as the context requires, December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Any reference to a future year refers to a year ending on December 31 of that year.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees was renamed transaction based and additionally includes expenses resulting from completed transactions, which are directly related to client revenues. Such expenses were previously reported in other expenses. Previously reported amounts have been conformed to the current presentation.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 3.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThe firm’s significant accounting policies include when and how to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities, measuring the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost, and when to consolidate an entity. See Note 4 for policies on fair value measurements, Note 9 for policies on the allowance for credit losses, and below and Note 17 for policies on consolidation accounting. All other significant accounting policies are either described below or included in the following footnotes:\nConsolidation\nThe firm consolidates entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest. The firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity (VIE).\nVoting Interest Entities.\nVoting interest entities are entities in which (i) the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities independently and (ii) the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If the firm has a controlling majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity is consolidated.\nVariable Interest Entities.\nA VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. The firm has a controlling financial interest in a VIE when the firm has a variable interest or interests that provide it with (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for further information about VIEs.\nEquity-Method Investments.\nWhen the firm does not have a controlling financial interest in an entity but can exert significant influence over the entity’s operating and financial policies, the investment is generally accounted for at fair value by electing the fair value option available under U.S. GAAP. Significant influence generally exists when the firm owns 20% to 50% of the entity’s common stock or\nin-substance\ncommon stock.\nIn certain cases, the firm applies the equity method of accounting to new investments that are strategic in nature or closely related to the firm’s principal business activities, when the firm has a significant degree of involvement in the cash flows or operations of the investee or when cost-benefit considerations are less significant. See Note 8 for further information about equity-method investments.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nInvestment Funds.\nThe firm has formed investment funds with third-party investors. These funds are typically organized as limited partnerships or limited liability companies for which the firm acts as general partner or manager. Generally, the firm does not hold a majority of the economic interests in these funds. These funds are usually voting interest entities and generally are not consolidated because third-party investors typically have rights to terminate the funds or to remove the firm as general partner or manager. Investments in these funds are generally measured at net asset value (NAV) and are included in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and 22 for further information about investments in funds.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions, the most important of which relate to fair value measurements, the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost, accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and provisions for losses that may arise from tax audits. These estimates and assumptions are based on the best available information but actual results could be materially different.\nRevenue Recognition\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value.\nTrading assets and liabilities and certain investments are recorded at fair value either under the fair value option or in accordance with other U.S. GAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to account for certain of its loans and other financial assets and liabilities at fair value by electing the fair value option. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. Fair value gains or losses are generally included in market making or other principal transactions. See Note 4 for further information about fair value measurements.\nRevenue from Contracts with Clients.\nThe firm recognizes revenue earned from contracts with clients for services, such as investment banking, investment management, and execution and clearing (contracts with clients), when the performance obligations related to the underlying transaction are completed.\nRevenues from contracts with clients represent approximately\n45\n% of total\nnon-interest\nrevenues for 2020 (including approximately\n90\n% of investment banking revenues, approximately\n95\n% of investment management revenues and all commissions and fees), and approximately\n45\n% of total\nnon-interest\nrevenues for 2019 (including approximately\n85\n% of investment banking revenues, approximately\n95\n% of investment management revenues and all commissions and fees\n)\n. See Note 25 for information about net revenues by business segment.\nInvestment Banking\nAdvisory.\nFees from financial advisory assignments are recognized in revenues when the services related to the underlying transaction are completed under the terms of the assignment.\nNon-refundable\ndeposits and milestone payments in connection with financial advisory assignments are recognized in revenues upon completion of the underlying transaction or when the assignment is otherwise concluded.\nExpenses associated with financial advisory assignments are recognized when incurred and are included in transaction based expenses. Client reimbursements for such expenses are included in investment banking revenues.\nUnderwriting.\nFees from underwriting assignments are recognized in revenues upon completion of the underlying transaction based on the terms of the assignment.\nExpenses associated with underwriting assignments are generally deferred until the related revenue is recognized or the assignment is otherwise concluded. Such expenses are included in transaction based expenses for completed assignments.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nInvestment Management\nThe firm earns management fees and incentive fees for investment management services, which are included in investment management revenues. The firm makes payments to brokers and advisors related to the placement of the firm’s investment funds (distribution fees), which are included in transaction based expenses.\nManagement Fees.\nManagement fees for mutual funds are calculated as a percentage of daily net asset value and are received monthly. Management fees for hedge funds and separately managed accounts are calculated as a percentage of\nmonth-end\nnet asset value and are generally received quarterly. Management fees for private equity funds are calculated as a percentage of monthly invested capital or committed capital and are received quarterly, semi-annually or annually, depending on the fund. Management fees are recognized over time in the period the services are provided.\nDistribution fees paid by the firm are calculated based on either a percentage of the management fee, the investment fund’s net asset value or the committed capital. Such fees are included in transaction based expenses.\nIncentive Fees.\nIncentive fees are calculated as a percentage of a fund’s or separately managed account’s return, or excess return above a specified benchmark or other performance target. Incentive fees are generally based on investment performance over a twelve-month period or over the life of a fund. Fees that are based on performance over a twelve-month period are subject to adjustment prior to the end of the measurement period. For fees that are based on investment performance over the life of the fund, future investment underperformance may require fees previously distributed to the firm to be returned to the fund.\nIncentive fees earned from a fund or separately managed account are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account. Therefore, incentive fees recognized during the period may relate to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods.\nCommissions and Fees\nThe firm earns commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on stock, options and futures markets, as well as\nover-the-counter\n(OTC) transactions. Commissions and fees are recognized on the day the trade is executed. The firm also provides third-party research services to clients in connection with certain soft-dollar arrangements. Third-party research costs incurred by the firm in connection with such arrangements are presented net within commissions and fees.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations are services that the firm has committed to perform in the future in connection with its contracts with clients. The firm’s remaining performance obligations are generally related to its financial advisory assignments and certain investment management activities. Revenues associated with remaining performance obligations relating to financial advisory assignments cannot be determined until the outcome of the transaction. For the firm’s investment management activities, where fees are calculated based on the net asset value of the fund or separately managed account, future revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations cannot be determined as such fees are subject to fluctuations in the market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account.\nThe firm is able to determine the future revenues associated with management fees calculated based on committed capital. As of December 2020, substantially all future net revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations will be recognized through 2028. Annual revenues associated with such performance obligations average less than $\n250\nmillion through 2028.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when the firm has relinquished control over the assets transferred. For transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales, any gains or losses are recognized in net revenues. Assets or liabilities that arise from the firm’s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets are initially recognized at fair value. For transfers of financial assets that are not accounted for as sales, the assets are generally included in trading assets and the transfer is accounted for as a collateralized financing, with the related interest expense recognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 11 for further information about transfers of financial assets accounted for as collateralized financings and Note 16 for further information about transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe firm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid overnight deposits held in the ordinary course of business. Cash and cash equivalents included cash and due from banks of $\n11.95\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n12.57\nbillion as of December 2019. Cash and cash equivalents also included interest-bearing deposits with banks of $\n143.89\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n120.98\nbillion as of December 2019.\nThe firm segregates cash for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. Cash and cash equivalents segregated for regulatory and other purposes were $\n24.52\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n22.78\nbillion as of December 2019. In addition, the firm segregates securities for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. See Note 11 for further information about segregated securities.\nCustomer and Other Receivables\nCustomer and other receivables included receivables from customers and counterparties of $\n82.39\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n50.90\nbillion as of December 2019, and receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations of $\n38.94\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n23.71\nbillion as of December 2019. Such receivables primarily consist of customer margin loans, receivables resulting from unsettled transactions and collateral posted in connection with certain derivative transactions.\nSubstantially all of these receivables are accounted for at amortized cost net of any allowance for credit losses, which generally approximates fair value. As these receivables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these receivables been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2020 and December 2019. See Note 10 for further information about customer and other receivables accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. Interest on customer and other receivables is recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest income.\nCustomer and other receivables includes receivables from contracts with clients and contract assets. Contract assets represent the firm’s right to receive consideration for services provided in connection with its contracts with clients for which collection is conditional and not merely subject to the passage of time. The firm’s receivables from contracts with clients were $\n2.60\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n2.27\nbillion as of December 2019. As of both December 2020 and December 2019 contract assets were not material.\nCustomer and Other Payables\nCustomer and other payables included payables to customers and counterparties of $\n183.57\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n170.21\nbillion as of December 2019, and payables to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations of $\n7.09\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n4.61\nbillion as of December 2019. Such payables primarily consist of customer credit balances related to the firm’s prime brokerage activities. Customer and other payables are accounted for at cost plus accrued interest, which generally approximates fair value. As these payables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these payables been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2020 and December 2019. Interest on customer and other payables is recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest expense.\nOffsetting Assets and Liabilities\nTo reduce credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, the firm may enter into master netting agreements or similar arrangements (collectively, netting agreements) with counterparties that permit it to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. A netting agreement is a contract with a counterparty that permits net settlement of multiple transactions with that counterparty, including upon the exercise of termination rights by a\nnon-defaulting\nparty. Upon exercise of such termination rights, all transactions governed by the netting agreement are terminated and a net settlement amount is calculated. In addition, the firm receives and posts cash and securities collateral with respect to its derivatives and securities financing transactions, subject to the terms of the related credit support agreements or similar arrangements (collectively, credit support agreements). An enforceable credit support agreement grants the\nnon-defaulting\nparty exercising termination rights the right to liquidate the collateral and apply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In order to assess enforceability of the firm’s right of setoff under netting and credit support agreements, the firm evaluates various factors, including applicable bankruptcy laws, local statutes and regulatory provisions in the jurisdiction of the parties to the agreement.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDerivatives are reported on a\nnet-by-counterparty\nbasis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) in the consolidated balance sheets when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement. Resale agreements and securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) and securities borrowed and loaned transactions with the same term and currency are presented on a\nnet-by-counterparty\nbasis in the consolidated balance sheets when such transactions meet certain settlement criteria and are subject to netting agreements.\nIn the consolidated balance sheets, derivatives are reported net of cash collateral received and posted under enforceable credit support agreements, when transacted under an enforceable netting agreement. In the consolidated balance sheets, resale and repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed and loaned, are not reported net of the related cash and securities received or posted as collateral. See Note 11 for further information about collateral received and pledged, including rights to deliver or repledge collateral. See Notes 7 and 11 for further information about offsetting assets and liabilities.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAssets and liabilities denominated in\nnon-U.S.\ncurrencies are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the consolidated balance sheets and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the period. Foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses on transactions in nonfunctional currencies are recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on translation of the financial statements of a\nnon-U.S.\noperation, when the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are included, net of hedges and taxes, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nLeases (ASC 842).\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU\nNo. 2016-02,\n“Leases (Topic 842).” This ASU requires that, for leases longer than one year, a lessee recognize in the balance sheet a\nright-of-use\nasset, representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability, representing the liability to make lease payments. It also requires that for finance leases, a lessee recognize interest expense on the lease liability, separately from the amortization of the\nright-of-use\nasset in the statements of earnings, while for operating leases, such amounts should be recognized as a combined expense. It also requires that for qualifying sale-leaseback transactions the seller recognize any gain or loss (based on the estimated fair value of the asset at the time of sale) when control of the asset is transferred instead of amortizing it over the lease period. In addition, this ASU requires expanded disclosures about the nature and terms of lease agreements.\nThe firm adopted this ASU in January 2019 under a modified retrospective approach. Upon adoption, in accordance with the ASU, the firm elected to not reassess the lease classification or initial direct costs of existing leases, and to not reassess whether existing contracts contain a lease. In addition, the firm has elected to account for each contract’s lease and\nnon-lease\ncomponents as a single lease component. The impact of adoption was a gross up of $\n1.77\nbillion on the firm’s consolidated balance sheet and an increase to retained earnings of $\n12\nmillion (net of tax) as of January 1, 2019.\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASC 326).\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU\nNo. 2016-13,\n“Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326) — Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” This ASU amends several aspects of the measurement of credit losses on certain financial instruments, including replacing the existing incurred credit loss model and other models with the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) model and amending certain aspects of accounting for purchased financial assets with deterioration in credit quality since origination.\nThe firm adopted this ASU in January 2020 under a modified retrospective approach. As a result of adopting this ASU, the firm’s allowance for credit losses on financial assets and commitments that are measured at amortized cost reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets and commitments, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. These expected credit losses are measured based on historical experience, current conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.\nThe cumulative effect of measuring the allowance under CECL as a result of adopting this ASU as of January 1, 2020 was an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $\n848\nmillion. The increase in the allowance is driven by the fact that the allowance under CECL covers expected credit losses over the full expected life of the loan portfolios and also takes into account forecasts of expected future economic conditions. In addition, in accordance with the ASU, the firm elected the fair value option for loans that were previously accounted for as Purchased Credit Impaired (PCI), which resulted in a decrease to the allowance for PCI loans of $\n169\nmillion. The cumulative effect of adopting this ASU was a decrease to retained earnings of $\n638\nmillion (net of tax).\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASC 848).\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU\nNo. 2020-04,\n“Reference Rate Reform — Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.” This ASU provides optional relief from applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. In addition, in January 2021 the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01 “Reference Rate Reform — Scope,” which clarified the scope of ASC 848 relating to contract modifications. The firm adopted these ASUs upon issuance and elected to apply the relief available to certain modified derivatives. The adoption of these ASUs did not have a material impact on the firm’s consolidated financial statements.\nNote 4.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. The firm measures certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks).\nThe best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active market. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is determined by reference to prices for similar instruments, quoted prices or recent transactions in less active markets, or internally developed models that primarily use market-based or independently sourced inputs, including, but not limited to, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, credit spreads and funding spreads (i.e., the spread or difference between the interest rate at which a borrower could finance a given financial instrument relative to a benchmark interest rate).\nU.S. GAAP has a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. This hierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, giving the highest priority to level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial instrument’s level in this hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to its fair value measurement. In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, the firm considers, among other factors, a portfolio’s net risk exposure to that input. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:\nLevel 1.\nInputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets to which the firm had access at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2.\nInputs to valuation techniques are observable, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3.\nOne or more inputs to valuation techniques are significant and unobservable.\nThe fair values for substantially all of the firm’s financial assets and liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and liabilities may require valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as counterparty and the firm’s credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence.\nThe valuation techniques and nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the firm’s financial instruments are described below. See Notes 5 through 10 for further information about significant unobservable inputs used to value level 3 financial instruments.\nValuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Trading Cash Instruments, Investments and Loans\nLevel 1.\nLevel 1 instruments include U.S. government obligations, most\nnon-U.S.\ngovernment obligations, certain agency obligations, certain corporate debt instruments, certain money market instruments and actively traded listed equities. These instruments are valued using quoted prices for identical unrestricted instruments in active markets. The firm defines active markets for equity instruments based on the average daily trading volume both in absolute terms and relative to the market capitalization for the instrument. The firm defines active markets for debt instruments based on both the average daily trading volume and the number of days with trading activity.\nLevel 2.\nLevel 2 instruments include certain\nnon-U.S.\ngovernment obligations, most agency obligations, most mortgage-backed loans and securities, most corporate debt instruments, most state and municipal obligations, most money market instruments, most other debt obligations, restricted or less liquid listed equities, certain private equities, commodities and certain lending commitments.\nValuations of level 2 instruments can be verified to quoted prices, recent trading activity for identical or similar instruments, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or firm) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nValuation adjustments are typically made to level 2 instruments (i) if the instrument is subject to transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other premiums and liquidity discounts that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value. Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence.\nLevel 3.\nLevel 3 instruments have one or more significant valuation inputs that are not observable. Absent evidence to the contrary, level 3 instruments are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequently, the firm uses other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Valuation inputs and assumptions are changed when corroborated by substantive observable evidence, including values realized on sales.\nValuation techniques of level 3 instruments vary by instrument, but are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques. The valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair values of each type of level 3 instrument are described below:\nLoans and Securities Backed by Commercial Real Estate\nLoans and securities backed by commercial real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by a single property or a portfolio of properties, and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. Significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses and include:\nLoans and Securities Backed by Residential Real Estate\nLoans and securities backed by residential real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by portfolios of residential real estate and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. Significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons to instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles. Significant inputs include:\nCorporate Debt Instruments\nCorporate debt instruments includes corporate loans, debt securities and convertible debentures. Significant inputs for corporate debt instruments are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons both to prices of credit default swaps that reference the same or similar underlying instrument or entity and to other debt instruments for the same or similar issuer for which observable prices or broker quotations are available. Significant inputs include:\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities consists of private equities. Recent third-party completed or pending transactions (e.g., merger proposals, debt restructurings, tender offers) are considered the best evidence for any change in fair value. When these are not available, the following valuation methodologies are used, as appropriate:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe firm also considers changes in the outlook for the relevant industry and financial performance of the issuer as compared to projected performance. Significant inputs include:\nOther Trading Cash Instruments, Investments and Loans\nThe significant inputs to the valuation of other instruments, such as\nnon-U.S.\ngovernment obligations and U.S. and\nnon-U.S.\nagency obligations, state and municipal obligations, and other loans and debt obligations are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons both to prices of credit default swaps that reference the same or similar underlying instrument or entity and to other debt instruments for the same issuer for which observable prices or broker quotations are available. Significant inputs include:\nValuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Derivatives\nThe firm’s level 2 and level 3 derivatives are valued using derivative pricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow models, correlation models and models that incorporate option pricing methodologies, such as Monte Carlo simulations). Price transparency of derivatives can generally be characterized by product type, as described below.\nLiquidity is essential to observability of all product types. If transaction volumes decline, previously transparent prices and other inputs may become unobservable. Conversely, even highly structured products may at times have trading volumes large enough to provide observability of prices and other inputs.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nLevel 1.\nLevel 1 derivatives include short-term contracts for future delivery of securities when the underlying security is a level 1 instrument, and exchange-traded derivatives if they are actively traded and are valued at their quoted market price.\nLevel 2.\nLevel 2 derivatives include OTC derivatives for which all significant valuation inputs are corroborated by market evidence and exchange-traded derivatives that are not actively traded and/or that are valued using models that calibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC derivatives.\nThe selection of a particular model to value a derivative depends on the contractual terms of and specific risks inherent in the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, model selection does not involve significant management judgment because outputs of models can be calibrated to market-clearing levels.\nValuation models require a variety of inputs, such as contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, discount rates (including those derived from interest rates on collateral received and posted as specified in credit support agreements for collateralized derivatives), credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, loss severity rates and correlations of such inputs. Significant inputs to the valuations of level 2 derivatives can be verified to market transactions, broker or dealer quotations or other alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or firm) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources.\nLevel 3.\nLevel 3 derivatives are valued using models which utilize observable level 1 and/or level 2 inputs, as well as unobservable level 3 inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm’s level 3 derivatives are described below.\nSubsequent to the initial valuation of a level 3 derivative, the firm updates the level 1 and level 2 inputs to reflect observable market changes and any resulting gains and losses are classified in level 3. Level 3 inputs are changed when corroborated by evidence, such as similar market transactions, third-party pricing services and/or broker or dealer quotations or other empirical market data. In circumstances where the firm cannot verify the model value by reference to market transactions, it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value. See Note 7 for further information about significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of level 3 derivatives.\nValuation Adjustments.\nValuation adjustments are integral to determining the fair value of derivative portfolios and are used to adjust the\nmid-market\nvaluations produced by derivative pricing models to the exit price valuation. These adjustments incorporate bid/offer spreads, the cost of liquidity, credit valuation adjustments and funding valuation adjustments, which account for the credit and funding risk inherent in the uncollateralized portion of derivative portfolios. The firm also makes funding valuation adjustments to collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the firm to deliver or repledge collateral received. Market-based inputs are generally used when calibrating valuation adjustments to market-clearing levels.\nIn addition, for derivatives that include significant unobservable inputs, the firm makes model or exit price adjustments to account for the valuation uncertainty present in the transaction.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nValuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Other Financial Instruments at Fair Value\nIn addition to trading cash instruments, derivatives, and certain investments and loans, the firm accounts for certain of its other financial assets and liabilities at fair value under the fair value option. Such instruments include repurchase agreements and substantially all resale agreements; securities borrowed and loaned in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) financing; certain customer and other receivables, including certain margin loans; certain time deposits, including structured certificates of deposit, which are hybrid financial instruments; substantially all other secured financings, including transfers of assets accounted for as financings; certain unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, substantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments; and other liabilities. These instruments are generally valued based on discounted cash flow techniques, which incorporate inputs with reasonable levels of price transparency, and are generally classified in level 2 because the inputs are observable. Valuation adjustments may be made for liquidity and for counterparty and the firm’s credit quality. The significant inputs used to value the firm’s other financial instruments are described below.\nResale and Repurchase Agreements and Securities Borrowed and Loaned.\nThe significant inputs to the valuation of resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and loaned are funding spreads, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and interest rates.\nCustomer and Other Receivables.\nThe significant inputs to the valuation of receivables are interest rates, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and funding spreads.\nDeposits.\nThe significant inputs to the valuation of time deposits are interest rates and the amount and timing of future cash flows.

Derivatives may be traded on an exchange (exchange-traded) or they may be privately negotiated contracts, which are usually referred to as OTC derivatives. Certain of the firm’s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties\n(OTC-cleared),\nwhile others are bilateral contracts between two counterparties (bilateral OTC).\nMarket Making.\nAs a market maker, the firm enters into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. In this role, the firm typically acts as principal and is required to commit capital to provide execution, and maintains market-making positions in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nRisk Management.\nThe firm also enters into derivatives to actively manage risk exposures that arise from its market-making and investing and financing activities. The firm’s holdings and exposures are hedged, in many cases, on either a portfolio or risk-specific basis, as opposed to an\ninstrument-by-instrument\nbasis. The offsetting impact of this economic hedging is reflected in the same business segment as the related revenues. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives designated as hedges under U.S. GAAP. These derivatives are used to manage interest rate exposure of certain fixed-rate unsecured borrowings and deposits, as well as to manage foreign exchange risk of certain\navailable-for-sale\nsecurities and the net investment in certain\nnon-U.S.\noperations.\nThe firm enters into various types of derivatives, including:\nDerivatives are reported on a\nnet-by-counterparty\nbasis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting). Derivatives are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received or posted under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting). Derivative assets are included in trading assets and derivative liabilities are included in trading liabilities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges are included in market making (for derivatives included in the Global Markets segment), and other principal transactions (for derivatives included in the remaining business segments) in the consolidated statements of earnings. For both the years ended December 2020 and December 2019, substantially all of the firm’s derivatives were included in the Global Markets segment.\nThe tables below present the gross fair value and the notional amounts of derivative contracts by major product type, the amounts of counterparty and cash collateral netting in the consolidated balance sheets, as well as cash and securities collateral posted and received under enforceable credit support agreements that do not meet the criteria for netting under U.S. GAAP.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents information, by product type, for derivatives included in the summary table above.\nLevel 3 Rollforward Commentary\nYear Ended December 2020.\nThe net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 derivatives of $\n838\nmillion (reflecting $\n226\nmillion of net realized gains and $\n612\nmillion of net unrealized gains) for 2020 included gains of $\n900\nmillion reported in market making and losses of $\n62\nmillion reported in other principal transactions.\nThe net unrealized gains on level 3 derivatives for 2020 were primarily attributable to gains on certain equity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in equity prices), gains on certain interest rate derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates), gains on certain commodity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of changes in commodity prices), and gains on certain credit derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in interest rates), partially offset by losses on certain currency derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and a decrease in interest rates).\nThe drivers of both transfers into level 3 derivatives and transfers out of level 3 derivatives during 2020 were not material.\nYear Ended December 2019.\nThe net realized and unrealized losses on level 3 derivatives of $\n336\nmillion (reflecting $\n118\nmillion of net realized gains and $\n454\nmillion of net unrealized losses) for 2019 included losses of $\n305\nmillion reported in market making and $\n31\nmillion reported in other principal transactions.\nThe net unrealized losses on level 3 derivatives for 2019 were primarily attributable to losses on certain equity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in equity prices), and losses on certain currency derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates), partially offset by gains on certain credit derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in interest rates), gains on certain commodity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of changes in commodity prices), and gains on certain interest rate derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in interest rates).\nThe drivers of transfers into level 3 derivatives during 2019 were not material.\nTransfers out of level 3 derivatives during 2019 primarily reflected transfers of certain equity derivative assets to level 2, principally due to certain unobservable inputs no longer being significant to the valuation of these derivatives.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nOTC Derivatives\nThe table below presents OTC derivative assets and liabilities by tenor and major product type.\nIn the table above:\nCredit Derivatives\nThe firm enters into a broad array of credit derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage the credit risk associated with market-making and investing and financing activities. Credit derivatives are actively managed based on the firm’s net risk position. Credit derivatives are generally individually negotiated contracts and can have various settlement and payment conventions. Credit events include failure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration of indebtedness, restructuring, repudiation and dissolution of the reference entity.\nThe firm enters into the following types of credit derivatives:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe firm economically hedges its exposure to written credit derivatives primarily by entering into offsetting purchased credit derivatives with identical underliers. Substantially all of the firm’s purchased credit derivative transactions are with financial institutions and are subject to stringent collateral thresholds. In addition, upon the occurrence of a specified trigger event, the firm may take possession of the reference obligations underlying a particular written credit derivative, and consequently may, upon liquidation of the reference obligations, recover amounts on the underlying reference obligations in the event of default.\nAs of December 2020, written credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $\n515.85\nbillion and purchased credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $\n558.18\nbillion, for total net notional purchased protection of $\n42.33\nbillion. As of December 2019, written credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $\n522.57\nbillion and purchased credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $\n581.76\nbillion, for total net notional purchased protection of $\n59.19\nbillion. The firm’s written and purchased credit derivatives primarily consist of credit default swaps.\nThe table below presents information about credit derivatives.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nImpact of Credit and Funding Spreads on Derivatives\nThe firm realizes gains or losses on its derivative contracts. These gains or losses include credit valuation adjustments (CVA) relating to uncollateralized derivative assets and liabilities, which represents the gains or losses (including hedges) attributable to the impact of changes in credit exposure, counterparty credit spreads, liability funding spreads (which includes the firm’s own credit), probability of default and assumed recovery. These gains or losses also include funding valuation adjustments (FVA) relating to uncollateralized derivative assets, which represents the gains or losses (including hedges) attributable to the impact of changes in expected funding exposures and funding spreads.\nThe table below presents information about CVA and FVA.\nBifurcated Embedded Derivatives\nThe table below presents the fair value and the notional amount of derivatives that have been bifurcated from their related borrowings.\nIn the table above, derivatives that have been bifurcated from their related borrowings are recorded at fair value and primarily consist of interest rate, equity and commodity products. These derivatives are included in unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, as well as other secured financings, with the related borrowings.\nDerivatives with Credit-Related Contingent Features\nCertain of the firm’s derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require the firm to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in the firm’s credit ratings. The firm assesses the impact of these bilateral agreements by determining the collateral or termination payments that would occur assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies. A downgrade by any one rating agency, depending on the agency’s relative ratings of the firm at the time of the downgrade, may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies.\nThe table below presents information about net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements (excluding collateral posted), the fair value of collateral posted and additional collateral or termination payments that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a\none-\nor\ntwo-notch\ndowngrade in the firm’s credit ratings.\nHedge Accounting\nThe firm applies hedge accounting for (i) certain interest rate swaps used to manage the interest rate exposure of certain fixed-rate unsecured long- and short-term borrowings and certain fixed-rate certificates of deposit, (ii) foreign exchange forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange risk of certain\navailable-for-sale\nsecurities and (iii) certain foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt used to manage foreign currency exposures on the firm’s net investment in certain\nnon-U.S.\noperations.\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging instrument must be highly effective at reducing the risk from the exposure being hedged. Additionally, the firm must formally document the hedging relationship at inception and assess the hedging relationship at least on a quarterly basis to ensure the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective over the life of the hedging relationship.\nFair Value Hedges\nThe firm designates certain interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of certain fixed-rate unsecured long- and short-term debt and fixed-rate certificates of deposit. These interest rate swaps hedge changes in fair value attributable to the designated benchmark interest rate (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate or Overnight Index Swap Rate), effectively converting a substantial portion of fixed-rate obligations into floating-rate obligations.\nThe firm applies a statistical method that utilizes regression analysis when assessing the effectiveness of these hedging relationships in achieving offsetting changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument and the risk being hedged (i.e., interest rate risk). An interest rate swap is considered highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value attributable to changes in the hedged risk when the regression analysis results in a coefficient of determination of 80% or greater and a slope between 80% and 125%.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor qualifying fair value hedges, gains or losses on derivatives are included in interest expense. The change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged is reported as an adjustment to its carrying value (hedging adjustment) and is also included in interest expense. When a derivative is no longer designated as a hedge, any remaining difference between the carrying value and par value of the hedged item is amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the hedged item using the effective interest method. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense.\nThe table below presents the gains/(losses) from interest rate derivatives accounted for as hedges and the related hedged borrowings and deposits, and total interest expense.\nThe table below presents the carrying value of deposits and unsecured borrowings that are designated in a hedging relationship and the related cumulative hedging adjustment (increase/(decrease)) from current and prior hedging relationships included in such carrying values.\nIn the table above, cumulative hedging adjustment included $\n6.34\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n3.48\nbillion as of December 2019 of hedging adjustments from prior hedging relationships that were\nde-designated\nand substantially all were related to unsecured long-term borrowings.\nIn addition,\ncumulative hedging adjustments for items no longer designated in a hedging relationship were $\n489\nmillion as of December 2020 and $\n425\nmillion as of December 2019 and substantially all were related to unsecured long-term borrowings.\nDuring 2020, the firm designated certain foreign exchange forward contracts as fair value hedges of the foreign exchange risk of certain\navailable-for-sale\nsecurities included in investments. The carrying value of such securities was $\n2.09\nbillion as of December 2020. The effectiveness of such hedges is assessed based on changes in spot rates. The losses on the hedges (relating to both spot and forward points) were $\n112\nmillion and the gains on the related available-for-sale securities were $\n110\nmillion, and were included in market making for 2020.\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe firm seeks to reduce the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on its net investments in certain\nnon-U.S.\noperations through the use of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt. For foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges, the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed based on the overall changes in the fair value of the forward contracts (i.e., based on changes in forward rates). For foreign currency-denominated debt designated as a hedge, the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed based on changes in spot rates. For qualifying net investment hedges, all gains or losses on the hedging instruments are included in currency translation.\nThe table below presents the gains/(losses) from net investment hedging.\nGains or losses on individual net investments in\nnon-U.S.\noperations are reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) when such net investments are sold or substantially liquidated. The gross and net gains and losses on hedges and the related net investments in\nnon-U.S.\noperations reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income for 2020 was $\n61\nmillion (reflecting a gain of $\n214\nmillion related to hedges and a loss of $\n153\nmillion on the related net investments in\nnon-U.S.\noperations). The gross and net gains and losses reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income were not material for both 2019 and 2018.\nThe firm had designated $\n4.97\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n3.05\nbillion as of December 2019 of foreign currency-denominated debt, included in unsecured long- and short-term borrowings, as hedges of net investments in\nnon-U.S.\nsubsidiaries.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 8.\nInvestments\nInvestments includes debt instruments and equity securities that are accounted for at fair value and are generally held by the firm in connection with its long-term investing activities. In addition, investments includes debt securities classified as\navailable-for-sale\nand\nheld-to-maturity\nthat are generally held in connection with the firm’s asset-liability management activities. Investments also consists of equity securities that are accounted for under the equity method.\nThe table below presents information about investments.\nEquity Securities and Debt Instruments, at Fair Value\nEquity securities and debt instruments, at fair value are accounted for at fair value either under the fair value option or in accordance with other U.S. GAAP, and the related fair value gains and losses are recognized in earnings.\nEquity Securities, at Fair Value.\nEquity securities, at fair value consists of the firm’s public and private equity-related investments in corporate and real estate entities.\nThe table below presents information about equity securities, at fair value.\nIn the table above:\nDebt Instruments, at Fair Value.\nDebt instruments, at fair value primarily includes mezzanine, senior and distressed debt.\nThe table below presents information about debt instruments, at fair value.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nInvestments in Funds at Net Asset Value Per Share.\nEquity securities and debt instruments,\nat fair value include investments in funds that are measured at NAV of the investment fund. The firm uses NAV to measure the fair value of fund investments when (i) the fund investment does not have a readily determinable fair value and (ii) the NAV of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of investment company accounting, including measurement of the investments at fair value.\nSubstantially all of the firm’s investments in funds at NAV consist of investments in firm-sponsored private equity, credit, real estate and hedge funds where the firm\nco-invests\nwith third-party investors.\nPrivate equity funds primarily invest in a broad range of industries worldwide, including leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations, growth investments and distressed investments. Credit funds generally invest in loans and other fixed income instruments and are focused on providing private high-yield capital for leveraged and management buyout transactions, recapitalizations, financings, refinancings, acquisitions and restructurings for private equity firms, private family companies and corporate issuers. Real estate funds invest globally, primarily in real estate companies, loan portfolios, debt recapitalizations and property. Private equity, credit and real estate funds are\nclosed-end\nfunds in which the firm’s investments are generally not eligible for redemption. Distributions will be received from these funds as the underlying assets are liquidated or distributed, the timing of which is uncertain.\nThe firm also invests in hedge funds, primarily multi-disciplinary hedge funds that employ a fundamental\nbottom-up\ninvestment approach across various asset classes and strategies. The firm’s investments in hedge funds primarily include interests where the underlying assets are illiquid in nature, and proceeds from redemptions will not be received until the underlying assets are liquidated or distributed, the timing of which is uncertain.\nPrivate equity, hedge and real estate funds described above are primarily “covered funds” as defined in the Volcker Rule of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) extended the conformance period to July 2022 for the firm’s investments in, and relationships with, certain legacy “illiquid funds” (as defined in the Volcker Rule) that were in place prior to December 2013. This extension is applicable to substantially all of the firm’s remaining investments in, and relationships with, such covered funds. Substantially all of the credit funds described above are not covered funds.\nThe table below presents the fair value of investments in funds at NAV and the related unfunded commitments.\nAvailable-for-Sale\nSecurities\nAvailable-for-sale\nsecurities are accounted for at fair value, and the related unrealized fair value gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) unless designated in a fair value hedging relationship.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nTransfers into level 3 investments during 2020 primarily reflected transfers of certain corporate debt securities from level 2 (principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer transactions in these instruments, and certain unobservable yield and duration inputs becoming significant to the valuation of these instruments) and transfers of certain private equity securities from level 2 (principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer transactions in these instruments).\nTransfers out of level 3 investments during 2020 primarily reflected transfers of certain private equity securities and corporate debt securities to level 2 (principally due to increased price transparency as a result of market evidence, including market transactions in these instruments).\nYear Ended December 2019.\nThe net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 investments of $\n1.55\nbillion (reflecting $\n252\nmillion of net realized gains and $\n1.30\nbillion of net unrealized gains) for 2019 included gains of $\n1.44\nbillion reported in other principal transactions and $\n108\nmillion reported in interest income.\nThe net unrealized gains on level 3 investments for 2019 primarily reflected gains on private equity securities, principally driven by corporate performance and company-specific events.\nTransfers into level 3 investments during 2019 primarily reflected transfers of certain private equity securities and corporate debt securities from level 2 (principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer transactions in these instruments).\nTransfers out of level 3 investments during 2019 primarily reflected transfers of certain private equity securities and corporate debt securities to level 2 (principally due to increased price transparency as a result of market evidence, including market transactions in these instruments).\nHeld-to-Maturity\nSecurities\nHeld-to-maturity\nsecurities are accounted for at amortized cost.\nThe table below presents information about\nheld-to-maturity\nsecurities by type and tenor.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 9.\nLoans\nLoans include (i) loans held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost net of allowance for loan losses or at fair value under the fair value option and (ii) loans held for sale that are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value. Interest on loans is recognized over the life of the loan and is recorded on an accrual basis.\nThe table below presents information about loans.\nThe following is a description of the loan types in the table above:\nLoans accounted for at amortized cost included PCI loans with a carrying value of $\n1.62\nbillion (outstanding principal balance of $\n3.23\nbillion and accretable yield of $\n220\nmillion) as of December 2019, which were secured by commercial and residential real estate. In January 2020, the firm elected the fair value option for these PCI loans in accordance with ASU\nNo. 2016-13.\nThese loans were primarily transferred to trading assets. See Note 3 for further information about adoption of this ASU.\nCredit Quality\nRisk Assessment.\nThe firm’s risk assessment process includes evaluating the credit quality of its loans. For corporate loans and a majority of wealth management, real estate and other loans, the firm performs credit reviews which include initial and ongoing analyses of its borrowers, resulting in an internal credit rating. A credit review is an independent analysis of the capacity and willingness of a borrower to meet its financial obligations and is performed on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances change that indicate that a review may be necessary. The determination of internal credit ratings also incorporates assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the borrower’s industry and the economic environment.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents gross loans by an internally determined public rating agency equivalent or other credit metrics and the concentration of secured and unsecured loans.\nIn the table above, other/unrated loans include installment and credit card loans of $\n8.09\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n6.61\nbillion as of December 2019 for which an important credit-quality indicator is the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit score (which measures a borrower’s creditworthiness by considering factors such as payment and credit history). FICO credit scores are periodically refreshed by the firm to assess the updated creditworthiness of the borrower. See “Vintage” below for information about installment and credit card loans by FICO credit scores. The vast majority of the remaining loans of $\n9.73\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n9.54\nbillion as of December 2019 included in the other/unrated category are secured. These loans primarily consist of wealth management loans backed by residential real estate and securities, and purchased real estate-backed loans. The firm’s risk assessment process for such loans includes reviewing certain key metrics, such as\nloan-to-value\nratio, delinquency status, collateral values, expected cash flows and other risk factors.\nThe firm also assigns a regulatory risk rating to its loans based on the definitions provided by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. Total loans included\n85\n% of loans as of December 2020 and\n91\n% of loans as of December 2019 that were rated\npass/non-criticized.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nVintage.\nThe table below presents gross loans accounted for at amortized cost (excluding installment and credit card loans) by an internally determined public rating agency equivalent or other credit metrics and origination year for term loans.\nIn the table above, revolving loans which converted to term loans were not material as of December 2020.\nThe table below presents gross installment loans by refreshed FICO credit scores and origination year and gross credit card loans by refreshed FICO credit scores.\nIn the table above, credit card loans consist of revolving lines of credit.\nCredit Concentrations.\nThe table below presents the concentration of gross loans by region.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNonaccrual and Past Due Loans.\nLoans accounted for at amortized cost (other than credit card loans) are placed on nonaccrual status when it is probable that the firm will not collect all principal and interest due under the contractual terms, regardless of the delinquency status or if a loan is past due for 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well collateralized and in the process of collection. At that time, all accrued but uncollected interest is reversed against interest income and interest subsequently collected is recognized on a cash basis to the extent the loan balance is deemed collectible. Otherwise, all cash received is used to reduce the outstanding loan balance. A loan is considered past due when a principal or interest payment has not been made according to its contractual terms. Credit card loans are not placed on nonaccrual status and accrue interest until the loan is paid in full or is\ncharged-off.\nIn certain circumstances, the firm may modify the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, typically in the form of a modification of loan covenants, but may also include forbearance of interest or principal, payment extensions or interest rate reductions. These modifications, to the extent significant, are considered troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). Loan modifications that extend payment terms for a period of less than 90 days are generally considered insignificant and therefore not reported as TDRs.\nIn response to the global outbreak of the coronavirus\n(COVID-19)\npandemic, the firm adopted the relief issued under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, as amended, and certain interpretive guidance issued by the U.S. banking agencies that provides for certain modified loans that would otherwise meet the definition of a TDR to not be classified as such. As of December 2020, the firm had $\n184\nmillion of loans accounted for at amortized cost that were not classified as TDRs as a result of this relief and interpretive guidance.\nThe table below presents information about past due loans.\nThe table below presents information about nonaccrual loans.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe firm’s allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost. Loans and lending commitments accounted for at fair value or accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value are not subject to an allowance for credit losses.\nThe firm adopted ASU\nNo. 2016-13\nin January 2020, which replaced the incurred credit loss model for recognizing credit losses with the CECL model. As a result, the firm’s allowance for credit losses effective January 2020 reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such loans and also considers forecasts of future economic conditions. Prior to January 2020, the allowance for credit losses reflected probable incurred credit losses. See Note 3 for further information about the adoption of CECL.\nTo determine the allowance for credit losses, the firm classifies its loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolios. Prior to January 2020, the firm also had PCI loans which were classified as a separate portfolio. These portfolios represent the level at which the firm has developed and documented its methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics.\nUnder CECL, the allowance for credit losses takes into account the weighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic conditions over the expected life of the loan and lending commitments. The expected life of each loan or lending commitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for extension options or demand features. The forecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse economic scenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expected lives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss information based on a\nnon-linear\nmodeled approach. The forecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk factors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios described below. The firm applies judgment in weighing individual scenarios each quarter based on a variety of factors, including the firm’s internally derived economic outlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and industry trends.\nThe allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk.\nManagement’s estimate of credit losses entails judgment about loan collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. The allowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves review and approval by senior management within the firm’s independent risk oversight and control functions. Personnel within the firm’s independent risk oversight and control functions are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected credit losses. While management uses the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used.\nThe table below presents gross loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost by portfolio.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn the table above, wholesale loans included $\n3.51\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n1.49\nbillion as of December 2019 of nonaccrual loans for which the allowance for credit losses was measured on an asset-specific basis. The allowance for credit losses on these loans was $\n649\nmillion as of December 2020 and $\n207\nmillion as of December 2019. These loans included $\n584\nmillion as of December 2020 and $\n754\nmillion as of December 2019 of loans which did not require a reserve as the loan was deemed to be recoverable.\nSee Note 18 for further information about lending commitments.\nThe following is a description of the methodology used to calculate the allowance for credit losses:\nWholesale.\nThe allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans and lending commitments that exhibit similar risk characteristics is measured using a modeled approach. These models determine the probability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors, including internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators, the borrower’s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower’s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. For lending commitments, the methodology also considers probability of drawdowns or funding. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include the\nloan-to-value\nratio, debt service ratio and home price index. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for wholesale loans and lending commitments include unemployment rates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and industrial delinquency rates, short- and long-term interest rates, and oil prices.\nThe allowance for loan losses for wholesale loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, such as nonaccrual loans or loans in a troubled debt restructuring, is calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective rate, the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral.\nWholesale loans are\ncharged-off\nagainst the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible.\nConsumer.\nThe allowance for credit losses for consumer loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics is calculated using a modeled approach which classifies consumer loans into pools based on borrower-related and exposure-related characteristics that differentiate a pool’s risk characteristics from other pools. The factors considered in determining a pool are generally consistent with the risk characteristics used for internal credit risk measurement and management and include key metrics, such as FICO credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for consumer loans include unemployment rates and delinquency rates. The expected life of revolving credit card loans is determined by modeling expected future draws and the timing and amount of repayments allocated to the funded balance. The firm does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on credit card lending commitments as they are cancellable by the firm.\nThe allowance for credit losses for consumer loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, such as loans in a troubled debt restructuring, is calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective rate.\nInstallment loans are\ncharged-off\nwhen they are 120 days past due. Credit card loans are\ncharged-off\nwhen they are 180 days past due.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAllowance for Credit Losses Rollforward\nThe table below presents information about the allowance for credit losses.\nIn the table above:\nAllowance for Credit Losses Rollforward Commentary\nYear Ended December 2020.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased by $\n2.63\nbillion during 2020.\nThe impact of CECL adoption for wholesale and consumer loans was driven by the fact that the allowance under CECL covers expected credit losses over the full expected life of the loan portfolios and also considers forecasts of expected future economic conditions. The impact of CECL adoption for PCI loans was as a result of the firm electing to apply the fair value option for such loans.\nThe provision for credit losses for wholesale and consumer loans reflected the continued impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic on economic conditions, which resulted in higher modeled expected losses and lower recoveries. The allowance for loan losses ratio for wholesale loans increased to\n2.7\n% as of December 2020 compared with\n1.1\n% as of December 2019, while the allowance for loan losses ratio for consumer loans increased to\n15.9\n% as of December 2020 compared with\n6.0\n% as of December 2019. The increase in the allowance for loan losses ratios reflected both the impact of adopting the CECL standard, as well as higher provision for credit losses.\nWhen modeling expected credit losses, the firm employs a weighted, multivariate forecast, which includes baseline, adverse and favorable economic scenarios. As of December 2020, the forecasted economic scenarios were most heavily weighted towards the baseline and adverse scenarios. The forecast model incorporated adjustments to reflect the impact of\nCOVID-19-related\neconomic support programs provided by national governments.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents the forecasted range (across the baseline, adverse and favorable scenarios) of the U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates used in the forecast model as of December 2020.\nIn the table above:\nIn addition, the provision for credit losses for wholesale loans was impacted by asset-specific provisions and ratings downgrades primarily related to borrowers in the diversified industrials, technology, media & communications and natural resources industries. Besides the weaker economic outlook related to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, the provision for credit losses for consumer loans for 2020 was also impacted by the growth of the credit card portfolio.\nNet charge-offs for 2020 for wholesale loans were substantially all related to corporate loans and net charge-offs for consumer loans were primarily related to installment loans.\nYear Ended December 2019.\nThe allowance for credit losses increased by $\n450\nmillion during the year ended December 2019.\nThe provision for credit losses for wholesale loans was substantially all related to corporate loans for the year ended December 2019. The provision for credit losses related to consumer loans was primarily related to installment loans for the year ended December 2019.\nNet charge-offs for wholesale loans were primarily related to corporate loans for the year ended December 2019. Net charge-offs for consumer loans were substantially all related to installment loans for the year ended December 2019.\nFair Value of Loans by Level\nThe table below presents loans held for investment accounted for at fair value under the fair value option by level within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe gains as a result of changes in the fair value of loans held for investment for which the fair value option was elected were $\n151\nmillion for 2020 and $\n355\nmillion for 2019. These gains were included in other principal transactions.\nSee Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value measurement policies and the valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of loans.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 10.\nFair Value Option\nOther Financial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value\nIn addition to trading assets and liabilities, and certain investments and loans, the firm accounts for certain of its other financial assets and liabilities at fair value, substantially all under the fair value option. The primary reasons for electing the fair value option are to:\nHybrid financial instruments are instruments that contain bifurcatable embedded derivatives and do not require settlement by physical delivery of nonfinancial assets (e.g., physical commodities). If the firm elects to bifurcate the embedded derivative from the associated debt, the derivative is accounted for at fair value and the host contract is accounted for at amortized cost, adjusted for the effective portion of any fair value hedges. If the firm does not elect to bifurcate, the entire hybrid financial instrument is accounted for at fair value under the fair value option.\nOther financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value under the fair value option include:\nFair Value of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities by Level\nThe table below presents, by level within the fair value hierarchy, other financial assets and liabilities at fair value, substantially all of which are accounted for at fair value under the fair value option.\nIn the table above, other financial assets are shown as positive amounts and other financial liabilities are shown as negative amounts.\nSee Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value measurement policies and the valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of other financial assets and liabilities.\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs\nSee below for information about the significant unobservable inputs used to value level 3 other financial assets and liabilities at fair value as of both December 2020 and December 2019.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nOther Secured Financings.\nThe ranges and weighted averages of significant unobservable inputs used to value level 3 other secured financings are presented below. These ranges and weighted averages exclude unobservable inputs that are only relevant to a single instrument, and therefore are not meaningful.\nAs of December 2020:\nAs of December 2019:\nGenerally, increases in yield or duration, in isolation, would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement as of\nperiod-end.\nDue to the distinctive nature of each of level 3 other secured financings, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform across such financings. See Note 11 for further information about other secured financings.\nDeposits, Unsecured Borrowings and Other Liabilities.\nSubstantially all of the firm’s deposits, unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, and other liabilities that are classified in level 3 are hybrid financial instruments. As the significant unobservable inputs used to value hybrid financial instruments primarily relate to the embedded derivative component of these deposits, unsecured borrowings and other liabilities, these unobservable inputs are incorporated in the firm’s derivative disclosures in Note 7. See Note 13 for further information about deposits, Note 14 for further information about unsecured borrowings and Note 15 for further information about other liabilities.\nRepurchase Agreements.\nAs of both December 2020 and December 2019, the firm’s level 3 repurchase agreements were not material.\nLevel 3 Rollforward\nThe table below presents a summary of the changes in fair value for level 3 other financial liabilities accounted for at fair value.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nGains and Losses on Other Financial Assets and Liabilities Accounted for at Fair Value Under the Fair Value Option\nThe table below presents the gains and losses recognized in earnings as a result of the election to apply the fair value option to certain financial assets and liabilities.\nIn the table above:\nSee Note 8 for information about gains/(losses) on equity securities and Note 9 for information about gains/(losses) on loans which are accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. Gains/(losses) on trading assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value under the fair value option are included in market making. See Note 5 for further information about gains/(losses) from market making.\nLong-Term Debt Instruments\nThe difference between the aggregate contractual principal amount and the related fair value of long-term other secured financings for which the fair value option was elected was not material as of both December 2020 and December 2019.\nThe fair value of unsecured long-term borrowings, for which the fair value option was elected, exceeded the aggregate contractual principal amount by $\n445\nmillion as of December 2020 and $\n199\nmillion as of December 2019. The amounts above include both principal-protected and\nnon-principal-protected\nlong-term borrowings.\nDebt Valuation Adjustment\nThe firm calculates the fair value of financial liabilities for which the fair value option is elected by discounting future cash flows at a rate which incorporates the firm’s credit spreads.\nThe table below presents information about the net debt valuation adjustment (DVA) gains/(losses) on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nLoans and Lending Commitments\nThe table below presents the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate contractual principal amount for loans (included in trading assets and loans in the consolidated balance sheets) for which the fair value option was elected.\nIn the table above, the aggregate contractual principal amount of loans on nonaccrual status and/or more than 90 days past due (which excludes loans carried at zero fair value and considered uncollectible) exceeds the related fair value primarily because the firm regularly purchases loans, such as distressed loans, at values significantly below the contractual principal amounts.\nThe fair value of unfunded lending commitments for which the fair value option was elected was a liability of $\n25\nmillion as of December 2020 and $\n24\nmillion as of December 2019, and the related total contractual amount of these lending commitments was $\n1.64\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n1.55\nbillion as of December 2019. See Note 18 for further information about lending commitments.\nImpact of Credit Spreads on Loans and Lending Commitments\nThe estimated net gain/(loss) attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit spreads on loans and lending commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $(\n106\n) million for 2020, $\n134\nmillion for 2019 and $\n211\nmillion for 2018. The firm generally calculates the fair value of loans and lending commitments for which the fair value option is elected by discounting future cash flows at a rate which incorporates the instrument-specific credit spreads. For floating-rate loans and lending commitments, substantially all changes in fair value are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit spreads, whereas for fixed-rate loans and lending commitments, changes in fair value are also attributable to changes in interest rates.\nNote 11.\nCollateralized Agreements and Financings\nCollateralized agreements are resale agreements and securities borrowed. Collateralized financings are repurchase agreements, securities loaned and other secured financings. The firm enters into these transactions in order to, among other things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain firm activities.\nCollateralized agreements and financings are presented on a\nnet-by-counterparty\nbasis when a legal right of setoff exists. Interest on collateralized agreements, which is included in interest income, and collateralized financings, which is included in interest expense, is recognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense.\nResale and Repurchase Agreements\nA resale agreement is a transaction in which the firm purchases financial instruments from a seller, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to resell the same or substantially the same financial instruments to the seller at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date.\nA repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date.\nEven though repurchase and resale agreements (including “repos- and\nreverses-to-maturity”)\ninvolve the legal transfer of ownership of financial instruments, they are accounted for as financing arrangements because they require the financial instruments to be repurchased or resold before or at the maturity of the agreement. The financial instruments purchased or sold in resale and repurchase agreements typically include U.S. government and agency, and investment-grade sovereign obligations.\nThe firm receives financial instruments purchased under resale agreements and makes delivery of financial instruments sold under repurchase agreements. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors the market value of these financial instruments on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in the market value of the financial instruments, as appropriate. For resale agreements, the firm typically requires collateral with a fair value approximately equal to the carrying value of the relevant assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nSecurities Borrowed and Loaned Transactions\nIn a securities borrowed transaction, the firm borrows securities from a counterparty in exchange for cash or securities. When the firm returns the securities, the counterparty returns the cash or securities. Interest is generally paid periodically over the life of the transaction.\nIn a securities loaned transaction, the firm lends securities to a counterparty in exchange for cash or securities. When the counterparty returns the securities, the firm returns the cash or securities posted as collateral. Interest is generally paid periodically over the life of the transaction.\nThe firm receives securities borrowed and makes delivery of securities loaned. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors the market value of these securities on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in the market value of the securities, as appropriate. For securities borrowed transactions, the firm typically requires collateral with a fair value approximately equal to the carrying value of the securities borrowed transaction.\nSecurities borrowed and loaned within FICC financing are recorded at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 10 for further information about securities borrowed and loaned accounted for at fair value.\nSecurities borrowed and loaned within Equities financing are recorded based on the amount of cash collateral advanced or received plus accrued interest. The firm also reviews securities borrowed to determine if an allowance for credit losses should be recorded by taking into consideration the fair value of collateral received. As these agreements generally can be terminated on demand, they exhibit little, if any, sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Therefore, the carrying value of such agreements approximates fair value. As these agreements are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these agreements been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, they would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2020 and December 2019.\nOffsetting Arrangements\nThe table below presents resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and loaned transactions included in the consolidated balance sheets, as well as the amounts not offset in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nGross Carrying Value of Repurchase Agreements and Securities Loaned\nThe table below presents the gross carrying value of repurchase agreements and securities loaned by class of collateral pledged.\nThe table below presents the gross carrying value of repurchase agreements and securities loaned by maturity.\nIn the table above:\nOther Secured Financings\nIn addition to repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions, the firm funds certain assets through the use of other secured financings and pledges financial instruments and other assets as collateral in these transactions. These other secured financings include:\nOther secured financings included nonrecourse arrangements. Nonrecourse other secured financings were $\n12.31\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n10.91\nbillion as of December 2019.\nThe firm has elected to apply the fair value option to substantially all other secured financings because the use of fair value eliminates\nnon-economic\nvolatility in earnings that would arise from using different measurement attributes. See Note 10 for further information about other secured financings that are accounted for at fair value.\nOther secured financings that are not recorded at fair value are recorded based on the amount of cash received plus accrued interest, which generally approximates fair value.\nAs these financings are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these financings been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, they would have been primarily classified in level 3 as of December 2020 and primarily classified in level 2 as of December 2019.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents information about other secured financings.\nIn the table above:\nThe table below presents other secured financings by maturity.\nIn the table above:\nCollateral Received and Pledged\nThe firm receives cash and securities (e.g., U.S. government and agency obligations, other sovereign and corporate obligations, as well as equity securities) as collateral, primarily in connection with resale agreements, securities borrowed, derivative transactions and customer margin loans. The firm obtains cash and securities as collateral on an upfront or contingent basis for derivative instruments and collateralized agreements to reduce its credit exposure to individual counterparties.\nIn many cases, the firm is permitted to deliver or repledge financial instruments received as collateral when entering into repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions, primarily in connection with secured client financing activities. The firm is also permitted to deliver or repledge these financial instruments in connection with other secured financings, collateralized derivative transactions and firm or customer settlement requirements.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe firm also pledges certain trading assets in connection with repurchase agreements, securities loaned transactions and other secured financings, and other assets (substantially all real estate and cash) in connection with other secured financings to counterparties who may or may not have the right to deliver or repledge them.\nThe table below presents financial instruments at fair value received as collateral that were available to be delivered or repledged and were delivered or repledged.\nThe table below presents information about assets pledged.\nThe firm also segregates securities for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. Such securities are segregated from trading assets and investments, as well as from securities received as collateral under resale agreements and securities borrowed transactions. Securities segregated by the firm were $\n32.97\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n26.76\nbillion as of December 2019.\nNote 12.\nOther Assets\nThe table below presents other assets by type.\nProperty, Leasehold Improvements and Equipment\nProperty, leasehold improvements and equipment is net of accumulated depreciation and amortization of $\n10.12\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n9.95\nbillion as of December 2019. Property, leasehold improvements and equipment included $\n6.54\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n6.16\nbillion as of December 2019 that the firm uses in connection with its operations, and $\n318\nmillion as of December 2020 and $\n521\nmillion as of December 2019 of foreclosed real estate primarily related to distressed loans that were purchased by the firm. The remainder is held by investment entities, including VIEs, consolidated by the firm.\nSubstantially all property and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease. Capitalized costs of software developed or obtained for internal use are amortized on a straight-line basis over\nthree years\n.\nThe firm tests property, leasehold improvements and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. To the extent the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group, the firm determines the asset or asset group is impaired and records an impairment equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset or asset group. In addition, the firm will recognize an impairment prior to the sale of an asset or asset group if the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.\nDuring 2020, there were $\n171\nmillion of impairments, primarily relating to properties held by the firm’s investment entities. There were no material impairments during 2019 or 2018.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date.\nThe table below presents the carrying value of goodwill by reporting unit.\nIn the table above, the increase in goodwill in Equities from December 2019 to December 2020 reflects the acquisition of Folio Financial, Inc. during 2020.\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment.\nThe quantitative goodwill test compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its estimated net book value (including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets). If the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its estimated net book value, goodwill is not impaired. An impairment is recognized if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated net book value.\nTo estimate the fair value of each reporting unit, other than Consumer banking, a relative value technique is used because the firm believes market participants would use this technique to value these reporting units. The relative value technique applies observable\nprice-to-earnings\nmultiples or\nprice-to-book\nmultiples of comparable competitors to reporting units’ net earnings or net book value. To estimate the fair value of Consumer banking, a discounted cash flow valuation approach is used because the firm believes market participants would use this technique to value that reporting unit given its early stage of development. The estimated net carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders’ equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders’ equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements.\nDuring 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic broadly impacted the operating environment. Uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic and its continued impact persisted throughout the year. As a result, the firm performed a qualitative assessment in each of the first, second and third quarters of 2020 with respect to each of the firm’s reporting units to determine whether it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of any of these reporting units was less than its estimated carrying value. Based on these qualitative assessments, the firm determined that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective estimated carrying value, and that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in each quarter, was not a triggering event to perform a quantitative test.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the firm performed its annual assessment of goodwill for impairment, for each of its reporting units, by performing a qualitative assessment. Multiple factors were assessed with respect to each of the firm’s reporting units to determine whether it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of any of these reporting units was less than its estimated carrying value. The qualitative assessment also considered changes since the quantitative test performed in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe firm considered the following factors in the qualitative annual assessment when evaluating whether it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit was less than its estimated carrying value:\nAs a result of the qualitative assessment, the firm determined that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective estimated carrying value. Therefore, the firm determined that goodwill for each reporting unit was not impaired and that a quantitative goodwill test was not required.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets\nThe table below presents identifiable intangible assets by reporting unit and type.\nThe firm acquired $\n155\nmillion of intangible assets during 2020, primarily related to acquired leases and customer lists, with a weighted average amortization period of\n10\nyears. The firm acquired $\n515\nmillion of intangible assets during 2019, primarily related to customer lists, with a weighted average amortization period of\n10\nyears.\nSubstantially all of the firm’s identifiable intangible assets have finite useful lives and are amortized over their estimated useful lives generally using the straight-line method.\nThe tables below present information about the amortization of identifiable intangible assets.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe firm tests intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. To the extent the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group, the firm determines the asset or asset group is impaired and records an impairment equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset or asset group. In addition, the firm will recognize an impairment prior to the sale of an asset or asset group if the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. There were no material impairments during 2020, 2019 or 2018.\nOperating Lease\nRight-of-Use\nAssets\nThe firm enters into operating leases for real estate, office equipment and other assets, substantially all of which are used in connection with its operations. For leases longer than one year, the firm recognizes a\nright-of-use\nasset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability representing the liability to make payments. The lease term is generally determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease. For leases where the firm has the option to terminate or extend the lease, an assessment of the likelihood of exercising the option is incorporated into the determination of the lease term. Such assessment is initially performed at the inception of the lease and is updated if events occur that impact the original assessment.\nAn operating lease\nright-of-use\nasset is initially determined based on the operating lease liability, adjusted for initial direct costs, lease incentives and amounts paid at or prior to lease commencement. This amount is then amortized over the lease term. The firm recognized $\n182\nmillion for 2020 and $\n963\nmillion (primarily related to the firm’s new European headquarters in London) for 2019 of\nright-of-use\nassets and operating lease liabilities in\nnon-cash\ntransactions for leases entered into or assumed. See Note 15 for information about operating lease liabilities.\nFor leases where the firm will derive no economic benefit from leased space that it has vacated or where the firm has shortened the term of a lease when space is no longer needed, the firm will record an impairment or accelerated amortization of\nright-of-use\nassets. There were no material impairments or accelerated amortizations during 2020 and 2019. See Note 3 for further information about ASU No. 2016-02 which was adopted in January 2019.\nMiscellaneous Receivables and Other\nMiscellaneous receivables and other included:\nNote 13.\nDeposits\nThe table below presents the types and sources of deposits.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents the location of deposits.\nIn the table above, U.S. deposits were held at Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA) and substantially all\nnon-U.S.\ndeposits were held at Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB).\nThe table below presents maturities of time deposits held in U.S. and\nnon-U.S.\noffices.\nAs of December 2020, deposits in U.S. offices included $\n11.71\nbillion and deposits in\nnon-U.S.\noffices included $\n12.25\nbillion of time deposits in denominations that met or exceeded the applicable insurance limits, or were otherwise not covered by insurance.\nThe firm’s savings and demand deposits are recorded based on the amount of cash received plus accrued interest\n, which approximates fair value. In addition, the firm designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges to convert a portion of its time deposits not accounted for at fair value from fixed-rate obligations into floating-rate obligations. The carrying value of time deposits not accounted for at fair value approximated fair value as of both December 2020 and December 2019. As these savings and demand deposits and time deposits are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these deposits been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, they would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2020 and December 2019.\nNote 14.\nUnsecured Borrowings\nThe table below presents information about unsecured borrowings.\nUnsecured Short-Term Borrowings\nUnsecured short-term borrowings includes the portion of unsecured long-term borrowings maturing within one year of the financial statement date and unsecured long-term borrowings that are redeemable within one year of the financial statement date at the option of the holder.\nThe firm accounts for certain hybrid financial instruments at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 10 for further information about unsecured short-term borrowings that are accounted for at fair value. In addition, the firm designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges to convert a portion of its unsecured short-term borrowings not accounted for at fair value from fixed-rate obligations into floating-rate obligations. The carrying value of unsecured short-term borrowings that are not recorded at fair value generally approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the obligations. As these unsecured short-term borrowings are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these borrowings been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2020 and December 2019.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents information about unsecured short-term borrowings.\nIn the table above:\nUnsecured Long-Term Borrowings\nThe table below presents information about unsecured long-term borrowings.\nIn the table above:\nThe table below presents unsecured long-term borrowings by maturity.\nIn the table above:\nThe firm designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges to convert a portion of fixed-rate unsecured long-term borrowings not accounted for at fair value into floating-rate obligations. See Note 7 for further information about hedging activities.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents unsecured long-term borrowings, after giving effect to such hedging activities.\nIn the table above, the aggregate amounts of unsecured long-term borrowings had weighted average interest rates of\n2.01\n% (\n3.34\n% related to fixed-rate obligations and\n1.70\n% related to floating-rate obligations) as of December 2020 and\n2.87\n% (\n3.77\n% related to fixed-rate obligations and\n2.48\n% related to floating-rate obligations) as of December 2019. These rates exclude unsecured long-term borrowings accounted for at fair value under the fair value option.\nThe carrying value of unsecured long-term borrowings for which the firm did not elect the fair value option was $\n172.57\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n163.42\nbillion as of December 2019. The estimated fair value of such unsecured long-term borrowings was $\n183.29\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n168.60\nbillion as of December 2019. As these borrowings are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these borrowings been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2020 and December 2019.\nSubordinated Borrowings\nUnsecured long-term borrowings includes subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt. Subordinated debt that matures within one year is included in unsecured short-term borrowings. Junior subordinated debt is junior in right of payment to other subordinated borrowings, which are junior to senior borrowings. Long-term subordinated debt had maturities ranging from\n2025\nto\n2045\nas of December 2020 and\n2021\nto\n2045\nas of December 2019.\nThe table below presents information about subordinated borrowings.\nIn the table above:\nJunior Subordinated Debt\nIn 2004, Group Inc. issued $\n2.84\nbillion of junior subordinated debt to Goldman Sachs Capital I (Trust), a Delaware statutory trust. The Trust issued $\n2.75\nbillion of guaranteed preferred beneficial interests (Trust Preferred securities) to third parties and $\n85\nmillion of common beneficial interests to Group Inc. As of December 2020, the outstanding par amount of junior subordinated debt held by the Trust was $\n968\nmillion and the outstanding par amount of Trust Preferred securities and common beneficial interests issued by the Trust was $\n939\nmillion and $\n29\nmillion, respectively. As of December 2019, the outstanding par amount of junior subordinated debt held by the Trust was $\n976\nmillion and the outstanding par amount of Trust Preferred securities and common beneficial interests issued by the Trust was $\n947\nmillion and $\n29\nmillion, respectively.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe firm purchased Trust Preferred securities with a par amount and a carrying value of $\n7.9\nmillion and $\n11.0\nmillion in 2020, $\n159\nmillion and $\n206\nmillion in 2019 and $\n28\nmillion and $\n35\nmillion in 2018, respectively. These securities were delivered to the Trust, along with common beneficial interests of $\n0.2\nmillion in 2020, $\n5\nmillion in 2019 and $\n1\nmillion in 2018, in a\nnon-cash\nexchange for junior subordinated debt with a par amount and carrying value of $\n8.1\nmillion and $\n12.5\nmillion in 2020, $\n164\nmillion and $\n231\nmillion in 2019, and $\n29\nmillion and $\n36\nmillion in 2018, respectively. Following the exchange, these Trust Preferred securities, common beneficial interests and junior subordinated debt were extinguished. The Trust is a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm for regulatory and legal purposes but is not consolidated for accounting purposes.\nThe firm pays interest semi-annually on the junior subordinated debt at an annual rate of\n6.345\n% and the debt matures on\nFebruary 15, 2034\n. The coupon rate and the payment dates applicable to the beneficial interests are the same as the interest rate and payment dates for the junior subordinated debt. The firm has the right, from time to time, to defer payment of interest on the junior subordinated debt, and therefore cause payment on the Trust’s preferred beneficial interests to be deferred, in each case up to ten consecutive semi-annual periods. During any such deferral period, the firm will not be permitted to, among other things, pay dividends on or make certain repurchases of its common stock. The Trust is not permitted to pay any distributions on the common beneficial interests held by Group Inc. unless all dividends payable on the preferred beneficial interests have been paid in full.\nThe firm has covenanted in favor of the holders of Group Inc.’s\n6.345\n% junior subordinated debt due\nFebruary 15, 2034\n, that, subject to certain exceptions, the firm will not redeem or purchase the capital securities issued by Goldman Sachs Capital II and Goldman Sachs Capital III (APEX Trusts) or shares of Group Inc.’s Perpetual\nNon-Cumulative\nPreferred Stock, Series E (Series E Preferred Stock), Perpetual\nNon-Cumulative\nPreferred Stock, Series F (Series F Preferred Stock) or Perpetual\nNon-Cumulative\nPreferred Stock, Series O, if the redemption or purchase results in less than $\n253\nmillion aggregate liquidation preference of that series outstanding, prior to specified dates in 2022 for a price that exceeds a maximum amount determined by reference to the net cash proceeds that the firm has received from the sale of qualifying securities.\nThe APEX Trusts hold Group Inc.’s Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock. These trusts are Delaware statutory trusts sponsored by the firm and wholly-owned finance subsidiaries of the firm for regulatory and legal purposes but are not consolidated for accounting purposes.\nNote 15.\nOther Liabilities\nThe table below presents other liabilities by type.\nIn the table above, accrued expenses and other includes contract liabilities, which represent consideration received by the firm in connection with its contracts with clients, prior to providing the service. As of both December 2020 and December 2019, the firm’s contract liabilities were not material.\nOperating Lease Liabilities\nFor leases longer than one year, the firm recognizes a\nright-of-use\nasset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability representing the liability to make payments. See Note 12 for information about operating lease\nright-of-use\nassets.\nThe table below presents information about operating lease liabilities.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn the table above, the weighted average discount rate represents the firm’s incremental borrowing rate as of January 2019 for operating leases existing on the date of adoption of ASU\nNo. 2016-02\nand at the lease inception date for leases entered into subsequent to the adoption of this ASU.\nOperating lease costs were $\n458\nmillion for 2020, $\n538\nmillion for 2019 and $\n409\nmillion for 2018. Variable lease costs, which are included in operating lease costs, were not material for 2020, 2019 and 2018. Total occupancy expenses for space held in excess of the firm’s current requirements were not material for both 2020 and 2019.\nLease payments relating to operating lease arrangements that were signed, but had not yet commenced as of December 2020, were not material.\nNote 16.\nSecuritization Activities\nThe firm securitizes residential and commercial mortgages, corporate bonds, loans and other types of financial assets by selling these assets to securitization vehicles (e.g., trusts, corporate entities and limited liability companies) or through a resecuritization. The firm acts as underwriter of the beneficial interests that are sold to investors. The firm’s residential mortgage securitizations are primarily in connection with government agency securitizations.\nThe firm accounts for a securitization as a sale when it has relinquished control over the transferred financial assets. Prior to securitization, the firm generally accounts for assets pending transfer at fair value and therefore does not typically recognize significant gains or losses upon the transfer of assets. Net revenues from underwriting activities are recognized in connection with the sales of the underlying beneficial interests to investors.\nThe firm generally receives cash in exchange for the transferred assets but may also have continuing involvement with the transferred financial assets, including ownership of beneficial interests in securitized financial assets, primarily in the form of debt instruments. The firm may also purchase senior or subordinated securities issued by securitization vehicles (which are typically VIEs) in connection with secondary market-making activities.\nThe primary risks included in beneficial interests and other interests from the firm’s continuing involvement with securitization vehicles are the performance of the underlying collateral, the position of the firm’s investment in the capital structure of the securitization vehicle and the market yield for the security. Interests accounted for at fair value are primarily classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Interests not accounted for at fair value are carried at amounts that approximate fair value. See Notes 4 through 10 for further information about fair value measurements.\nThe table below presents the amount of financial assets securitized and the cash flows received on retained interests in securitization entities in which the firm had continuing involvement as of the end of the period.\nIn the table above, financial assets securitized included assets of $\n551\nmillion for 2020, $\n601\nmillion for 2019 and $\n882\nmillion for 2018, which were securitized in a\nnon-cash\nexchange for loans and investments.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents information about nonconsolidated securitization entities to which the firm sold assets and had continuing involvement as of the end of the period.\nIn the table above:\nIn addition to the interests in the table above, the firm had other continuing involvement in the form of derivative transactions and commitments with certain nonconsolidated VIEs. The carrying value of these derivatives and commitments was a net asset of $\n52\nmillion as of December 2020 and $\n57\nmillion as of December 2019, and the notional amount of these derivatives and commitments was $\n1.43\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n1.20\nbillion as of December 2019. The notional amounts of these derivatives and commitments are included in maximum exposure to loss in the nonconsolidated VIE table in Note 17.\nThe table below presents information about the weighted average key economic assumptions used in measuring the fair value of mortgage-backed retained interests.\nIn the table above:\nThe firm has other retained interests not reflected in the table above with a fair value of $\n192\nmillion and a weighted average life of\n3.9\nyears as of December 2020, and a fair value of $\n149\nmillion and a weighted average life of\n3.3\nyears as of December 2019. Due to the nature and fair value of certain of these retained interests, the weighted average assumptions for constant prepayment and discount rates and the related sensitivity to adverse changes are not meaningful as of both December 2020 and December 2019. The firm’s maximum exposure to adverse changes in the value of these interests is the carrying value of $\n192\nmillion as of December 2020 and $\n149\nmillion as of December 2019.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 17.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA variable interest in a VIE is an investment (e.g., debt or equity) or other interest (e.g., derivatives or loans and lending commitments) that will absorb portions of the VIE’s expected losses and/or receive portions of the VIE’s expected residual returns.\nThe firm’s variable interests in VIEs include senior and subordinated debt; loans and lending commitments; limited and general partnership interests; preferred and common equity; derivatives that may include foreign currency, equity and/or credit risk; guarantees; and certain of the fees the firm receives from investment funds. Certain interest rate, foreign currency and credit derivatives the firm enters into with VIEs are not variable interests because they create, rather than absorb, risk.\nVIEs generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt and equity securities that are either collateralized by or indexed to the assets held by the VIE. The debt and equity securities issued by a VIE may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. The firm’s involvement with VIEs includes securitization of financial assets, as described in Note 16, and investments in and loans to other types of VIEs, as described below. See Note 3 for the firm’s consolidation policies, including the definition of a VIE.\nVIE Consolidation Analysis\nThe enterprise with a controlling financial interest in a VIE is known as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis that principally considers:\nThe firm reassesses its evaluation of whether an entity is a VIE when certain reconsideration events occur. The firm reassesses its determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on current facts and circumstances.\nVIE Activities\nThe firm is principally involved with VIEs through the following business activities:\nMortgage-Backed VIEs.\nThe firm sells residential and commercial mortgage loans and securities to mortgage-backed VIEs and may retain beneficial interests in the assets sold to these VIEs. The firm purchases and sells beneficial interests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in connection with market-making activities. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives with certain of these VIEs, primarily interest rate swaps, which are typically not variable interests. The firm generally enters into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk.\nReal Estate, Credit- and Power-Related and Other Investing VIEs.\nThe firm purchases equity and debt securities issued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold real estate, performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets and equity securities. The firm generally does not sell assets to, or enter into derivatives with, these VIEs.\nCorporate Debt and Other Asset-Backed VIEs.\nThe firm structures VIEs that issue notes to clients, purchases and sells beneficial interests issued by corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs in connection with market-making activities, and makes loans to VIEs that warehouse corporate debt. Certain of these VIEs synthetically create the exposure for the beneficial interests they issue by entering into credit derivatives with the firm, rather than purchasing the underlying assets. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives, such as total return swaps, with certain corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs, under which the firm pays the VIE a return due to the beneficial interest holders and receives the return on the collateral owned by the VIE. The collateral owned by these VIEs is primarily other asset-backed loans and securities. The firm may be removed as the total return swap counterparty and may enter into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk related to these swaps. The firm may sell assets to the corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs it structures.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPrincipal-Protected Note VIEs.\nThe firm structures VIEs that issue principal-protected notes to clients. These VIEs own portfolios of assets, principally with exposure to hedge funds. Substantially all of the principal protection on the notes issued by these VIEs is provided by the asset portfolio rebalancing that is required under the terms of the notes. The firm enters into total return swaps with these VIEs under which the firm pays the VIE the return due to the principal-protected note holders and receives the return on the assets owned by the VIE. The firm may enter into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk. The firm also obtains funding through these VIEs.\nInvestments in Funds.\nThe firm makes equity investments in certain investment fund VIEs it manages and is entitled to receive fees from these VIEs. The firm has generally not sold assets to, or entered into derivatives with, these VIEs.\nNonconsolidated VIEs\nThe table below presents a summary of the nonconsolidated VIEs in which the firm holds variable interests.\nIn the table above:\nThe table below presents information, by principal business activity, for nonconsolidated VIEs included in the summary table above.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAs of both December 2020 and December 2019, the carrying values of the firm’s variable interests in nonconsolidated VIEs are included in the consolidated balance sheets as follows:\nConsolidated VIEs\nThe table below presents a summary of the carrying value and balance sheet classification of assets and liabilities in consolidated VIEs.\nIn the table above:\nThe table below presents information, by principal business activity, for consolidated VIEs included in the summary table above.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 18.\nCommitments, Contingencies and Guarantees\nCommitments\nThe table below presents commitments by type.\nThe table below presents commitments by expiration.\nLending Commitments\nThe firm’s commercial and warehouse financing lending commitments are agreements to lend with fixed termination dates and depend on the satisfaction of all contractual conditions to borrowing. These commitments are presented net of amounts syndicated to third parties. The total commitment amount does not necessarily reflect actual future cash flows because the firm may syndicate portions of these commitments. In addition, commitments can expire unused or be reduced or cancelled at the counterparty’s request. The firm also provides credit to consumers by issuing credit card lines.\nThe table below presents information about lending commitments.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nCommercial Lending.\nThe firm’s commercial lending commitments were primarily extended to investment-grade corporate borrowers. Such commitments primarily included $\n110.31\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n101.31\nbillion as of December 2019, related to relationship lending activities (principally used for operating and general corporate purposes) and $\n15.81\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n27.71\nbillion as of December 2019, related to other investment banking activities (generally extended for contingent acquisition financing and are often intended to be short-term in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other funding sources). The firm also extends lending commitments in connection with other types of corporate lending, as well as commercial real estate financing. See Note 9 for further information about funded loans.\nTo mitigate the credit risk associated with the firm’s commercial lending activities, the firm obtains credit protection on certain loans and lending commitments through credit default swaps, both single-name and index-based contracts, and through the issuance of credit-linked notes. In addition, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. provides the firm with credit loss protection on certain approved loan commitments.\nWarehouse Financing.\nThe firm provides financing to clients who warehouse financial assets. These arrangements are secured by the warehoused assets, primarily consisting of residential real estate, consumer and corporate loans.\nCredit Cards.\nThe firm’s credit card lending commitments represents credit card lines issued by the firm to consumers. These credit card lines are cancellable by the firm. In January 2021, the firm entered into a co-branded credit card relationship with General Motors and agreed to acquire the related credit card portfolio from Capital One. The purchase price for this portfolio will depend on the outstanding balance of credit card loans at the time that the acquisition closes, which is expected to be in September 2021. As of December 2020, this portfolio had outstanding credit card loans of approximately $\n2.0\nbillion. In connection with this acquisition, the firm’s results will include a provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2021, currently estimated at $\n180\nmillion.\nRisk Participations\nThe firm also risk participates certain of its commercial lending commitments to other financial institutions. In the event of a risk participant’s default, the firm will be responsible to fund the borrower.\nCollateralized Agreement Commitments/ Collateralized Financing Commitments\nCollateralized agreement commitments includes forward starting resale and securities borrowing agreements, and collateralized financing commitments includes forward starting repurchase and secured lending agreements that settle at a future date, generally within three business days. Collateralized agreement commitments also includes transactions where the firm has entered into commitments to provide contingent financing to its clients and counterparties through resale agreements. The firm’s funding of these commitments depends on the satisfaction of all contractual conditions to the resale agreement and these commitments can expire unused.\nLetters of Credit\nThe firm has commitments under letters of credit issued by various banks which the firm provides to counterparties in lieu of securities or cash to satisfy various collateral and margin deposit requirements.\nInvestment Commitments\nInvestment commitments includes commitments to invest in private equity, real estate and other assets directly and through funds that the firm raises and manages. Investment commitments included $\n1.69\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n2.06\nbillion as of December 2019, related to commitments to invest in funds managed by the firm. If these commitments are called, they would be funded at market value on the date of investment.\nContingencies\nLegal Proceedings.\nSee Note 27 for information about legal proceedings, including certain mortgage-related matters.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nOther Contingencies.\nIn connection with the settlement agreement with the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group of the U.S. Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, the firm agreed to provide $\n1.80\nbillion in consumer relief by January 2021. As of January 2021, the firm has provided consumer relief that it expects to satisfy this requirement, subject to validation by the independent monitor overseeing the firm’s compliance with its consumer relief obligations. This relief was provided in the form of principal forgiveness for underwater homeowners and distressed borrowers; financing for construction, rehabilitation and preservation of affordable housing; and support for debt restructuring, foreclosure prevention and housing quality improvement programs, as well as land banks.\nGuarantees\nThe table below presents derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee, securities lending and clearing guarantees and certain other financial guarantees.\nIn the table above:\nDerivative Guarantees.\nThe firm enters into various derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including written equity and commodity put options, written currency contracts and interest rate caps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives are risk managed together with derivatives that do not meet the definition of a guarantee, and therefore the amounts in the table above do not reflect the firm’s overall risk related to derivative activities. Disclosures about derivatives are not required if they may be cash settled and the firm has no basis to conclude it is probable that the counterparties held the underlying instruments at inception of the contract. The firm has concluded that these conditions have been met for certain large, internationally active commercial and investment bank counterparties, central clearing counterparties, hedge funds and certain other counterparties.\nAccordingly, the firm has not included such contracts in the table above. See Note 7 for information about credit derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee, which are not included in the table above.\nDerivatives are accounted for at fair value and therefore the carrying value is considered the best indication of payment/performance risk for individual contracts. However, the carrying values in the table above exclude the effect of counterparty and cash collateral netting.\nSecurities Lending and Clearing Guarantees.\nSecurities lending and clearing guarantees include the indemnifications and guarantees that the firm provides in its capacity as an agency lender and in its capacity as a sponsoring member of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation.\nAs an agency lender, the firm indemnifies most of its securities lending customers against losses incurred in the event that borrowers do not return securities and the collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the securities borrowed. The maximum payout of such indemnifications was $\n19.86\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n17.89\nbillion as of December 2019. Collateral held by the lenders in connection with securities lending indemnifications was $\n20.39\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n19.14\nbillion as of December 2019. Because the contractual nature of these arrangements requires the firm to obtain collateral with a market value that exceeds the value of the securities lent to the borrower, there is minimal performance risk associated with these indemnifications.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020,\nthe firm became a sponsoring member of the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in connection with certain resale and repurchase agreements. As a sponsoring member, the firm guarantees the performance of its sponsored member clients to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. To minimize potential losses on such guarantees, the firm obtains a security interest in the collateral that the sponsored client placed with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. Therefore, the risk of loss on such guarantees is minimal. As of December 2020, the maximum payout on this guarantee was\n$\n1.49\nbillion and the related collateral held was $\n1.50\nbillion\n.\nOther Financial Guarantees.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the firm provides other financial guarantees of the obligations of third parties (e.g., standby letters of credit and other guarantees to enable clients to complete transactions and fund-related guarantees). These guarantees represent obligations to make payments to beneficiaries if the guaranteed party fails to fulfill its obligation under a contractual arrangement with that beneficiary. Other financial guarantees also include a guarantee that the firm has provided to the Government of Malaysia that it will receive at least $\n1.4\nbillion in assets and proceeds from assets seized by governmental authorities around the world related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a sovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB). See Note 27 for\nfurther information. The firm will periodically evaluate progress toward satisfying the\n$\n1.4\nbillion obligation based on information to be received on a semi-annual basis, expected in February and August.\nGuarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts.\nThe firm has established trusts, including Goldman Sachs Capital I, the APEX Trusts and other entities, for the limited purpose of issuing securities to third parties, lending the proceeds to the firm and entering into contractual arrangements with the firm and third parties related to this purpose. The firm does not consolidate these entities. See Note 14 for further information about the transactions involving Goldman Sachs Capital I and the APEX Trusts.\nThe firm effectively provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of the securities issued by these entities. Timely payment by the firm of amounts due to these entities under the guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements will be sufficient to cover payments due on the securities issued by these entities.\nManagement believes that it is unlikely that any circumstances will occur, such as nonperformance on the part of paying agents or other service providers, that would make it necessary for the firm to make payments related to these entities other than those required under the terms of the guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements and in connection with certain expenses incurred by these entities.\nIndemnities and Guarantees of Service Providers.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the firm indemnifies and guarantees certain service providers, such as clearing and custody agents, trustees and administrators, against specified potential losses in connection with their acting as an agent of, or providing services to, the firm or its affiliates.\nThe firm may also be liable to some clients or other parties for losses arising from its custodial role or caused by acts or omissions of third-party service providers, including\nsub-custodians\nand third-party brokers. In certain cases, the firm has the right to seek indemnification from these third-party service providers for certain relevant losses incurred by the firm. In addition, the firm is a member of payment, clearing and settlement networks, as well as securities exchanges around the world that may require the firm to meet the obligations of such networks and exchanges in the event of member defaults and other loss scenarios.\nIn connection with the firm’s prime brokerage and clearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear and settle on behalf of its clients the transactions entered into by them with other brokerage firms. The firm’s obligations in respect of such transactions are secured by the assets in the client’s account, as well as any proceeds received from the transactions cleared and settled by the firm on behalf of the client. In connection with joint venture investments, the firm may issue loan guarantees under which it may be liable in the event of fraud, misappropriation, environmental liabilities and certain other matters involving the borrower.\nThe firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities related to these guarantees and indemnifications have been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of both December 2020 and December 2019.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nOther Representations, Warranties and Indemnifications.\nThe firm provides representations and warranties to counterparties in connection with a variety of commercial transactions and occasionally indemnifies them against potential losses caused by the breach of those representations and warranties. The firm may also provide indemnifications protecting against changes in or adverse application of certain U.S. tax laws in connection with ordinary-course transactions, such as securities issuances, borrowings or derivatives.\nIn addition, the firm may provide indemnifications to some counterparties to protect them in the event additional taxes are owed or payments are withheld, due either to a change in or an adverse application of certain\nnon-U.S.\ntax laws.\nThese indemnifications generally are standard contractual terms and are entered into in the ordinary course of business. Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts included in these indemnifications, and the contingencies triggering the obligation to indemnify are not expected to occur. The firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities related to these arrangements have been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of both December 2020 and December 2019.\nGuarantees of Subsidiaries.\nGroup Inc. fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by GS Finance Corp., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm. Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), GS Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, Group Inc. has provided a guarantee to GS Bank USA related to assets that GS Bank USA has acquired from certain subsidiaries and affiliated funds of Group Inc., and Group Inc. has provided guarantees to Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE) related to agreements that each entity has entered into with certain of its counterparties.\nGroup Inc. guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a\ntransaction-by-transaction\nbasis, as negotiated with counterparties. Group Inc. is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under its subsidiary guarantees. However, because these obligations are also obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, Group Inc.’s liabilities as guarantor are not separately disclosed.\nNote 19.\nShareholders’ Equity\nCommon Equity\nAs of both December 2020 and December 2019, the firm had\n4.00\nbillion authorized shares of common stock and\n200\nmillion authorized shares of nonvoting common stock, each with a par value of $\n0.01\nper share.\nThe firm’s share repurchase program is intended to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The share repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with\nRule 10b5-1\nand accelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by the firm’s current and projected capital position, and capital deployment opportunities, but which may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of the firm’s common stock. The firm suspended stock repurchases during the first quarter of 2020 and, consistent with the FRB’s requirement for all large bank holding companies (BHCs), extended the suspension of stock repurchases through the fourth quarter of 2020. The firm resumed stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2021.\nThe table below presents information about common stock repurchases.\nPursuant to the terms of certain share-based compensation plans, employees may remit shares to the firm or the firm may cancel share-based awards to satisfy statutory employee tax withholding requirements and the exercise price of stock options. Under these\nplans,\n3,476\nshares in 2020,\n7,490\nshares in 2019 and\n1,120\nshares in 2018 were remitted with a total value of $\n0.9\nmillion in 2020, $\n2\nmillion in 2019 and $\n0.3\nmillion in 2018, and the firm cancelled\n3.4\nmillion share-based awards in 2020,\n3.8\nmillion in 2019 and\n5.0\nmillion in 2018 with a total value of $\n829\nmillion in 2020, $\n743\nmillion in 2019 and $\n1.24\nbillion in 2018.\nThe table below presents common stock dividends declared.\nOn\nJanuary 15, 2021\n, the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board) declared a dividend of $\n1.25\nper common share to be paid on\nMarch 30, 2021\nto common shareholders of record on\nMarch 2, 2021\n.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPreferred Equity\nThe tables below present information about the perpetual preferred stock issued and outstanding as of December 2020.\nIn the tables above:\nIn February 2021, the firm redeemed all outstanding shares of its Series M\n5.375\n% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock (Series M Preferred Stock) with a redemption value of $\n2\nbillion. The difference between the redemption value and net carrying value at the time of this redemption was $\n21\nmillion, which will be treated as an addition to preferred stock dividends in the first quarter of 2021.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the firm redeemed the remaining\n14,000\noutstanding shares of its Series L\n5.70\n%\nNon-Cumulative\nPreferred Stock (Series L Preferred Stock) with a redemption value of $\n350\nmillion ($\n25,000\nper share), plus accrued and unpaid dividends. The difference between the redemption value and net carrying value at the time of this redemption was $\n1\nmillion, which was recorded as an addition to preferred stock dividends in 2020.\nIn 2019, the firm redeemed\n38,000\nshares of its outstanding Series L Preferred Stock with a redemption value of $\n950\nmillion ($\n25,000\nper share), plus accrued and unpaid dividends. In addition, in 2019, the firm redeemed the remaining\n6,000\noutstanding shares of its Series B\n6.20\n%\nNon-Cumulative\nPreferred Stock (Series B Preferred Stock) with a redemption value of $\n150\nmillion ($\n25,000\nper share). The difference between the redemption value and net carrying value at the time of these redemptions was $\n9\nmillion, which was recorded as an addition to preferred stock dividends in 2019.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents the dividend rates of perpetual preferred stock as of December 2020.\nIn the table above, dividends on each series of preferred stock are payable in arrears for the periods specified.\nThe table below presents preferred stock dividends declared.\nOn January 13, 2021, Group Inc. declared dividends of $\n239.58\nper share of Series A Preferred Stock, $\n255.56\nper share of Series C Preferred Stock, $\n255.56\nper share of Series D Preferred Stock, $\n343.75\nper share of Series J Preferred Stock, $\n398.44\nper share of Series K Preferred Stock, $\n393.75\nper share of Series N Preferred Stock, $\n687.50\nper share of Series Q Preferred Stock, $\n618.75\nper share of Series R Preferred Stock and $\n550.00\nper share of Series S Preferred Stock to be paid on February 10, 2021 to preferred shareholders of record on January 26, 2021. In addition, the firm declared dividends of $\n1,000.00\nper share of Series E Preferred Stock and $\n1,000.00\nper share of Series F Preferred Stock to be paid on March 1, 2021 to preferred shareholders of record on February 14, 2021.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)\nThe table below presents changes in the accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax, by type.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 20.\nRegulation and Capital Adequacy\nThe FRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a BHC under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and a financial holding company under amendments to this Act. The firm is subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework).\nThe capital requirements are expressed as risk-based capital and leverage ratios that compare measures of regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets (RWAs), average assets and\noff-balance\nsheet exposures. Failure to comply with these capital requirements could result in restrictions being imposed by the firm’s regulators and could limit the firm’s ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments. The firm’s capital levels are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors. Furthermore, certain of the firm’s subsidiaries are subject to separate regulations and capital requirements.\nCapital Framework\nThe regulations under the Capital Framework are largely based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (Basel Committee) capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (Basel III) and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the Capital Framework, the firm is an “Advanced approach” banking organization and has been designated as a global systemically important bank\n(G-SIB).\nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum risk-based capital and the capital conservation buffer requirements. The buffer must consist entirely of capital that qualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital.\nPrior to October 1, 2020, the capital conservation buffer requirements under both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules were comprised of (i) a\n2.5\n% buffer, (ii) the countercyclical capital buffer and (iii) the G-SIB surcharge. Beginning on October 1, 2020, the 2.5% buffer was replaced with the stress capital buffer under the Standardized Capital Rules. The components of\nthe\ncapital conservation buffer requirements under the Advanced Capital Rules remain unchanged.\nThe firm calculates its CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in accordance with the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. Beginning on October 1, 2020, each of the ratios calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules must meet the respective capital requirements. Prior to October 1, 2020, the lower of each risk-based capital ratio calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules was the ratio against which the firm’s compliance with its risk-based capital requirements was assessed.\nUnder the Capital Framework, the firm is also subject to leverage requirements which consist of a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), as well as the SLR buffer.\nConsolidated Regulatory Capital Requirements\nRisk-Based Capital Ratios.\nThe table below presents the risk-based capital requirements.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents information about risk-based capital ratios.\nIn the table above:\nLeverage Ratios.\nThe table below presents the leverage requirements.\nIn the table above, the SLR requirement of\n5\n% includes a minimum of\n3\n% and a\n2\n% buffer applicable to G-SIBs.\nThe table below presents information about leverage ratios.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nRisk-Based Capital.\nThe table below presents information about risk-based capital.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents changes in CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.\nRWAs.\nRWAs are calculated in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules.\nCredit Risk\nCredit RWAs are calculated based on measures of exposure, which are then risk weighted under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules:\nMarket Risk\nRWAs for market risk in accordance with the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules are generally consistent. Market RWAs are calculated based on measures of exposure which include the following:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor both risk management purposes and regulatory capital calculations, the firm uses a single VaR model which captures risks, including those related to interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. However, VaR used for risk management purposes differs from VaR used for regulatory capital requirements (regulatory VaR) due to differences in time horizons, confidence levels and the scope of positions on which VaR is calculated. For risk management purposes, a\n95\n%\none-day\nVaR is used, whereas for regulatory capital requirements, a\n99\n%\n10\n-day\nVaR is used to determine Market RWAs and a\n99\n%\none-day\nVaR is used to determine regulatory VaR exceptions. In addition, the daily net revenues used to determine risk management VaR exceptions (i.e., comparing the daily net revenues to the VaR measure calculated as of the end of the prior business day) include intraday activity, whereas the Capital Framework requires that intraday activity be excluded from daily net revenues when calculating regulatory VaR exceptions. Intraday activity includes bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature. As a result, there may be differences in the number of VaR exceptions and the amount of daily net revenues calculated for regulatory VaR compared to the amounts calculated for risk management VaR.\nThe firm’s positional losses observed on a single day exceeded its\n99\n%\none\n-day\nregulatory VaR on six occasions during 2020 (all of which occurred during March 2020) and exceeded its\n99\n%\none-day\nregulatory VaR on one occasion during 2019. As permitted by the FRB, the firm has permanently excluded the six exceptions that occurred in March 2020 in determining the firm’s VaR multiplier used to calculate Market RWAs;\nOperational Risk\nOperational RWAs are only required to be included under the Advanced Capital Rules. The firm utilizes an internal risk-based model to quantify Operational RWAs.\nThe table below presents information about RWAs.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents changes in RWAs.\nRWAs Rollforward Commentary\nYear Ended December 2020.\nStandardized Credit RWAs as of December 2020 decreased by $\n13.55\nbillion compared with December 2019, primarily reflecting a decrease in equity investments, principally due to the sale of certain equity positions, and a decrease in other, principally due to decreased receivables as a result of changes in risk measurements. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in securities financing transactions, principally due to increased funding exposures. Standardized Market RWAs as of December 2020 increased by $\n4.14\nbillion compared with December 2019, primarily reflecting an increase in regulatory VaR, principally due to increased market volatility, and an increase in incremental risk, principally due to increased exposures in equities held for market-making purposes. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in specific risk, principally due to changes in risk measurements on certain exposures.\nAdvanced Credit RWAs as of December 2020 increased by $\n51.63\nbillion compared with December 2019, primarily reflecting an increase in derivatives, principally due to the impact of higher levels of volatility and counterparty credit risk and an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans, principally due to increased lending activity. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in equity investments, principally due to the sale of certain equity positions. Advanced Market RWAs as of December 2020 increased by $\n4.34\nbillion compared with December 2019, primarily reflecting an increase in regulatory VaR, principally due to increased market volatility, and an increase in incremental risk, principally due to increased exposures in equities held for market-making purposes. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in specific risk, principally due to changes in risk measurements on certain exposures. Advanced Operational RWAs as of December 2020 increased by $\n9.13\nbillion compared with December 2019. The vast majority of this increase was associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nYear Ended December 2019.\nStandardized Credit RWAs as of December 2019 increased by $\n25.65\nbillion compared with December 2018, primarily reflecting an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans, principally due to an increase in lending activity, and an increase in other credit RWAs, principally due to the recognition of operating lease\nright-of-use\nassets upon adoption of ASU\nNo. 2016-02\nand an increase in corporate debt exposures. Standardized Market RWAs as of December 2019 decreased by $\n9.98\nbillion compared with December 2018, primarily reflecting a decrease in specific risk, principally due to reduced exposures, and a decrease in incremental risk, principally due to reduced exposures and changes in risk measurements.\nAdvanced Credit RWAs as of December 2019 decreased by $\n7.67\nbillion compared with December 2018. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, the firm made changes to the calculation of the loss given default for certain wholesale exposures which resulted in a decrease in credit RWAs, primarily in commitments, guarantees and loans and derivatives. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in other credit RWAs, principally due to the recognition of operating lease\nright-of-use\nassets upon adoption of ASU\nNo. 2016-02\nand an increase in corporate debt exposures. Advanced Market RWAs as of December 2019 decreased by $\n10.19\nbillion compared with December 2018, primarily reflecting a decrease in specific risk, principally due to reduced exposures, and a decrease in incremental risk, principally due to reduced exposures and changes in risk measurements. Advanced Operational RWAs as of December 2019 increased by $\n4.40\nbillion compared with December 2018, associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nBank Subsidiaries\nRegulatory Capital Ratios.\nGS Bank USA, the firm’s primary U.S. bank subsidiary, is an FDIC-insured, New York State-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, is supervised and regulated by the FRB, the FDIC, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and is subject to regulatory capital requirements that are calculated under the Capital Framework. GS Bank USA is an Advanced approach banking organization under the Capital Framework.\nThe Capital Framework includes the minimum risk-based capital and the capital conservation buffer requirements (consisting of a 2.5% buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer). The buffer must consist entirely of capital that qualifies as CET1 capital. In addition, the Capital Framework includes the leverage ratio requirement.\nGS Bank USA is required to calculate the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. The lower of each risk-based capital ratio under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules is the ratio against which GS Bank USA’s compliance with its risk-based capital requirements is assessed. In addition, under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action applicable to GS Bank USA, in order to meet the quantitative requirements for a “well-capitalized” depository institution, GS Bank USA must also meet the “well-capitalized” requirements in the table below. GS Bank USA’s capital levels and prompt corrective action classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors. Failure to comply with the capital requirements, including a breach of the buffers described below, could result in restrictions being imposed by the regulators.\nThe table below presents GS Bank USA’s risk-based capital, leverage and “well-capitalized” requirements.\nIn the table above:\nThe table below presents information about GS Bank USA’s risk-based capital ratios.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents information about GS Bank USA’s leverage ratios.\nIn the table above:\nThe firm’s principal\nnon-U.S.\nbank subsidiaries, GSIB and GSBE, are also subject to regulatory capital requirements. GSIB is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), and GSBE is directly supervised by the European Central Bank and additionally by BaFin and Deutsche Bundesbank in the context of the E.U. Single Supervisory Mechanism. As of both December 2020 and December 2019, GSIB and GSBE were in compliance with their regulatory capital requirements.\nOther.\nThe deposits of GS Bank USA are insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by law. The FRB requires that GS Bank USA maintain cash reserves with the Federal Reserve. The amount deposited by GS Bank USA at the Federal Reserve was $\n52.71\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n50.55\nbillion as of December 2019, which exceeded required reserve amounts by $\n52.71\nbillion as of December 2020 (as the FRB reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent in 2020) and $\n50.29\nbillion as of December 2019.\nRestrictions on Payments\nGroup Inc. may be limited in its ability to access capital held at certain subsidiaries as a result of regulatory, tax or other constraints. These limitations include provisions of applicable law and regulations and other regulatory restrictions that limit the ability of those subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends without prior regulatory approval. Also, as a result of GS Bank USA’s election to exclude holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at the Federal Reserve from its total leverage exposure, any dividend by GS Bank USA during the period from July 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 is subject to the prior approval of the FRB. Furthermore, the amount of dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. The FRB, the FDIC and the NYDFS have authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise (including GS Bank USA) if, in the regulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.\nIn addition, subsidiaries not subject to separate regulatory capital requirements may hold capital to satisfy local tax and legal guidelines, rating agency requirements (for entities with assigned credit ratings) or internal policies, including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based on its underlying level of risk.\nGroup Inc.’s equity investment in subsidiaries was $\n103.80\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n95.68\nbillion as of December 2019, of which Group Inc. was required to maintain $\n63.68\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n57.58\nbillion as of December 2019, of minimum equity capital in its regulated subsidiaries in order to satisfy the regulatory requirements of such subsidiaries.\nGroup Inc.’s capital invested in certain\nnon-U.S.\nsubsidiaries is exposed to foreign exchange risk, substantially all of which is managed through a combination of derivatives and\nnon-U.S.\ndenominated debt. See Note 7 for information about the firm’s net investment hedges used to hedge this risk.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 21.\nEarnings Per Common Share\nBasic earnings per common share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net earnings to common by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and restricted stock units (RSUs) for which the delivery of the underlying common stock is not subject to satisfaction of future service or performance conditions (collectively, basic shares). Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and, in addition, reflects the dilutive effect of the common stock deliverable for stock options and for RSUs for which the delivery of the underlying common stock is subject to satisfaction of future service or performance conditions.\n​​​​​​​\nThe table below presents information about basic and diluted EPS.\nIn the table above:\nNote 22.\nTransactions with Affiliated Funds\nThe firm has formed nonconsolidated investment funds with third-party investors. As the firm generally acts as the investment manager for these funds, it is entitled to receive management fees and, in certain cases, advisory fees or incentive fees from these funds. Additionally, the firm invests alongside the third-party investors in certain funds.\nThe tables below present information about affiliated funds.\nThe firm may periodically determine to waive certain management fees on selected money market funds. Management fees waived were $\n109\nmillion for 2020, $\n44\nmillion for 2019 and $\n51\nmillion for 2018.\nThe Volcker Rule restricts the firm from providing financial support to covered funds (as defined in the rule) after the expiration of the conformance period. As a general matter, in the ordinary course of business, the firm does not expect to provide additional voluntary financial support to any covered funds, but may choose to do so with respect to funds that are not subject to the Volcker Rule. However, any such support is not expected to be material to the results of operations of the firm.\nIn March 2020, GS Bank USA and unaffiliated entities purchased certificates of deposit and commercial paper from two money market funds managed by the firm. These funds are not covered funds under the Volcker Rule. GS Bank USA’s purchase price of these securities was $\n1.84\nbillion, of which $\n321\nmillion was outstanding as of December 2020. These purchases were made to promote liquidity in the short-term credit markets and to increase the funds’ weekly liquid assets. These securities are included within investments in the consolidated balance sheets. Group Inc. has provided a guarantee to GS Bank USA in connection with these securities. See Note 18 for information about guarantees provided by Group Inc. to subsidiaries.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn addition, the firm had an outstanding guarantee, as permitted under the Volcker Rule, on behalf of its funds of $\n87\nmillion as of both December 2020 and December 2019. The firm has voluntarily provided this guarantee in connection with a financing agreement with a third-party lender executed by one of the firm’s real estate funds that is not covered by the Volcker Rule. Except as noted above, the firm has not provided any additional financial support to its affiliated funds during 2020 and 2019.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, the firm may also engage in other activities with its affiliated funds, including, among others, securities lending, trade execution, market-making, custody, and acquisition and bridge financing. See Note 18 for information about the firm’s investment commitments related to these funds.\nNote 23.\nInterest Income and Interest Expense\nInterest is recorded over the life of the instrument on an accrual basis based on contractual interest rates.\nThe table below presents sources of interest income and interest expense.\nIn the table above:\nNote 24.\nIncome Taxes\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIncome taxes are provided for using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The firm reports interest expense related to income tax matters in provision for taxes and income tax penalties in other expenses.\nThe table below presents information about the provision for taxes.\nIn the table above, U.S. federal current tax expense and U.S. federal deferred tax benefit in 2018 includes the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation).\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate.\nIn the table above,\nNon-U.S.\noperations include the impact of the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax and Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI).\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years and are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized and primarily relate to the ability to utilize losses in various tax jurisdictions. Tax assets are included in other assets and tax liabilities are included in other liabilities.\nThe table below presents information about deferred tax assets and liabilities, excluding the impact of netting within tax jurisdictions.\nThe firm has recorded deferred tax assets of $\n510\nmillion as of December 2020 and $\n411\nmillion as of December 2019, in connection with U.S. federal, state and local and foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The firm also recorded a valuation allowance of $\n79\nmillion as of both December 2020 and December 2019, related to these net operating loss carryforwards.\nAs of December 2020, the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward was $\n1.00\nbillion, the state and local net operating loss carryforward was $\n1.07\nbillion, and the foreign net operating loss carryforward was $\n1.06\nbillion. If not utilized, the U.S. federal\n,\nthe state and local, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in\n2021\n. If these carryforwards expire, they will not have a material impact on the firm’s results of operations. As of December 2020, the firm has recorded deferred tax assets of $\n14\nmillion in connection with general business credit carryforwards and $\n20\nmillion in connection with state and local tax credit carryforwards. If not utilized, the general business credit carryforward will begin to expire in\n2021\nand the state and local tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in\n2023\n. As of December 2020, the firm did not have any foreign tax credit carryforwards.\nAs of both December 2020 and December 2019, the firm had no U.S. capital loss carryforwards and\nno\nrelated net deferred income tax assets. As of December 2020, the firm had deferred tax assets of $\n258\nmillion in connection with foreign capital loss carryforwards and a valuation allowance of $\n258\nmillion related to these capital loss carryforwards.\nThe valuation allowance increased by $\n84\nmillion during 2020 and increased by $\n222\nmillion during 2019. The increases in both 2020 and 2019 were primarily due to an increase in deferred tax assets from which the firm does not expect to realize any benefit.\nThe firm permanently reinvested eligible earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. As of both December 2020 and December 2019, all U.S. taxes were accrued on these subsidiaries’ distributable earnings, substantially all of which resulted from the Tax Legislation repatriation tax and GILTI.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe firm recognizes tax positions in the consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized on settlement. A liability is established for differences between positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe accrued liability for interest expense related to income tax matters and income tax penalties was $\n129\nmillion as of December 2020 and $\n198\nmillion as of December 2019. The firm recognized interest expense and income tax penalties of $\n41\nmillion for 2020, $\n60\nmillion for 2019 and $\n18\nmillion for 2018. It is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits could change significantly during the twelve months subsequent to December 2020 due to potential audit settlements. However, at this time it is not possible to estimate any potential change.\nThe table below presents the changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which is included in other liabilities.\nRegulatory Tax Examinations\nThe firm is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing authorities in jurisdictions where the firm has significant business operations, such as the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong and various states, such as New York. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. The firm does not expect completion of these audits to have a material impact on the firm’s financial condition, but it may be material to operating results for a particular period, depending, in part, on the operating results for that period.\nThe table below presents the earliest tax years that remain subject to examination by major jurisdiction.\nThe firm has been accepted into the Compliance Assurance Process program by the IRS for each of the tax years from 2013 through 2020 and submitted an application for 2021. This program allows the firm to work with the IRS to identify and resolve potential U.S. Federal tax issues before the filing of tax returns. The fieldwork for tax years 2011 through 2017 has been completed. During 2020, the firm reached an agreement with the IRS on certain items related to tax years through 2017, which did not have a material impact on the effective tax rate. The final resolution of the audit for tax years 2011 through 2017 is not expected to have a material impact on the effective tax rate. The 2018 and 2019 tax years remain subject to post-filing review.\nDuring 2020, New York State and City examinations (excluding GS Bank USA) of 2011 through 2014 were completed. The resolution of these examinations did not have a material impact on the effective tax rate. New York State and City examinations for GS Bank USA through 2014 were completed in 2016. New York State and City examinations of 2015 through 2018 are expected to commence in 2021.\nAll years, including and subsequent to the years in the table above, remain open to examination by the taxing authorities. The firm believes that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits it has established is adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 25.\nBusiness Segments\nThe firm reports its activities in four business segments: Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management and Consumer & Wealth Management. See Note 1 for information about the firm’s business segments.\nCompensation and benefits expenses in the firm’s segments reflect, among other factors, the overall performance of the firm, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently,\npre-tax\nmargins in one segment of the firm’s business may be significantly affected by the performance of the firm’s other business segments.\nThe firm allocates assets (including allocations of global core liquid assets and cash, secured client financing and other assets), revenues and expenses among the four business segments. Due to the integrated nature of these segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses. The allocation process is based on the manner in which management currently views the performance of the segments.\nThe allocation of common shareholders’ equity and preferred stock dividends to each segment is based on the estimated amount of equity required to support the activities of the segment under relevant regulatory capital requirements.\nNet earnings for each segment is calculated by applying the firmwide tax rate to each segment’s\npre-tax\nearnings.\nManagement believes that this allocation provides a reasonable representation of each segment’s contribution to consolidated net earnings to common, return on average common equity and total assets. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates.\nSegment Results\nThe table below presents a summary of the firm’s segment results.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn the table above:\nThe table below presents depreciation and amortization expense by segment.\nSegment Assets\nThe table below presents assets by segment.\nThe table below presents gross loans by segment and loan type, and allowance for loan losses by segment.\nSee Note 9 for further information about loans.\nGeographic Information\nDue to the highly integrated nature of international financial markets, the firm manages its businesses based on the profitability of the enterprise as a whole. The methodology for allocating profitability to geographic regions is dependent on estimates and management judgment because a significant portion of the firm’s activities require cross-border coordination in order to facilitate the needs of the firm’s clients. Geographic results are generally allocated as follows:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe table below presents total net revenues,\npre-tax\nearnings and net earnings by geographic region.\nIn the table above:\nNote 26.\nCredit Concentrations\nThe firm’s concentrations of credit risk arise from its market making, client facilitation, investing, underwriting, lending and collateralized transactions, and cash management activities, and may be impacted by changes in economic, industry or political factors. These activities expose the firm to many different industries and counterparties, and may also subject the firm to a concentration of credit risk to a particular central bank, counterparty, borrower or issuer, including sovereign issuers, or to a particular clearing house or exchange. The firm seeks to mitigate credit risk by actively monitoring exposures and obtaining collateral from counterparties as deemed appropriate.\nThe firm measures and monitors its credit exposure based on amounts owed to the firm after taking into account risk mitigants that the firm considers when determining credit risk. Such risk mitigants include netting and collateral arrangements and economic hedges, such as credit derivatives, futures and forward contracts. Netting and collateral agreements permit the firm to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and/or enable the firm to obtain collateral on an upfront or contingent basis.\nThe table below presents the credit concentrations included in trading cash instruments and investments.\nIn addition, the firm had $\n116.63\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n96.97\nbillion as of December 2019 of cash deposits held at central banks (included in cash and cash equivalents), of which $\n52.71\nbillion as of December 2020 and $\n50.55\nbillion as of December 2019 was held at the Federal Reserve.\nAs of both December 2020 and December 2019, the firm did not have credit exposure to any other counterparty that exceeded 2% of total assets.\nCollateral obtained by the firm related to derivative assets is principally cash and is held by the firm or a third-party custodian. Collateral obtained by the firm related to resale agreements and securities borrowed transactions is primarily U.S. government and agency obligations and\nnon-U.S.\ngovernment and agency obligations. See Note 11 for further information about collateralized agreements and financings.\nThe table below presents U.S. government and agency obligations and\nnon-U.S.\ngovernment and agency obligations that collateralize resale agreements and securities borrowed transactions.\nIn the table above:\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 27.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe firm is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings (including those described below) concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of the firm’s businesses. Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages.\nUnder ASC 450, an event is “reasonably possible” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely” and an event is “remote” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.” Thus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss for cases in which the firm is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for which the firm believes the risk of loss is more than slight.\nWith respect to matters described below for which management has been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss where (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have claimed an amount of money damages, (ii) the firm is being, or threatened to be, sued by purchasers in a securities offering and is not being indemnified by a party that the firm believes will pay the full amount of any judgment, or (iii) the purchasers are demanding that the firm repurchase securities, management has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss as being equal to (a) in the case of (i), the amount of money damages claimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the difference between the initial sales price of the securities that the firm sold in such offering and the estimated lowest subsequent price of such securities prior to the action being commenced and (c) in the case of (iii), the price that purchasers paid for the securities less the estimated value, if any, as of December 2020 of the relevant securities, in each of cases (i), (ii) and (iii), taking into account any other factors believed to be relevant to the particular matter or matters of that type. As of the date hereof, the firm has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss for such matters and for any other matters described below where management has been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible aggregate loss to be approximately $\n0.9\nbillion in excess of the aggregate reserves for such matters.\nManagement is generally unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for matters other than those included in the estimate above, including where (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have not claimed an amount of money damages, except in those instances where management can otherwise determine an appropriate amount, (ii) matters are in early stages, (iii) matters relate to regulatory investigations or reviews, except in those instances where management can otherwise determine an appropriate amount, (iv) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (v) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (vi) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (vii) there are novel legal issues presented. For example, the firm’s potential liabilities with respect to the investigations and reviews described below in “Regulatory Investigations and Reviews and Related Litigation” generally are not included in management’s estimate of reasonably possible loss. However, management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of such other matters will have a material adverse effect on the firm’s financial condition, though the outcomes could be material to the firm’s operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period. See Note 18 for further information about mortgage-related contingencies.\n1MDB-Related Matters\nBetween 2012 and 2013, subsidiaries of the firm acted as arrangers or purchasers of approximately $\n6.5\nbillion of debt securities of 1MDB. On November 1, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed a criminal information and guilty plea by Tim Leissner, a former participating managing director of the firm, and an indictment against Ng Chong Hwa, a former managing director of the firm, and Low Taek Jho. Leissner pleaded guilty to a\ntwo-count\ncriminal information charging him with conspiring to launder money and conspiring to violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act’s (FCPA) anti-bribery and internal accounting controls provisions. Low and Ng were charged in a three-count indictment with conspiring to launder money and conspiring to violate the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions. On August 28, 2018, Leissner’s guilty plea was accepted by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York and Leissner was adjudicated guilty on both counts. Ng was also charged in this indictment with conspiring to violate the FCPA’s internal accounting controls provisions. On May 6, 2019, Ng pleaded not guilty to the DOJ’s criminal charges.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nOn August 18, 2020, the firm announced that it entered into a settlement agreement with the Government of Malaysia to resolve the criminal and regulatory proceedings in Malaysia involving the firm, which includes a guarantee that the Government of Malaysia receives at least $\n1.4\nbillion in assets and proceeds from assets seized by governmental authorities around the world related to 1MDB.\nOn October 22, 2020, the firm announced that it reached settlements of governmental and regulatory investigations relating to 1MDB with the DOJ, the SEC, the FRB, the NYDFS, the FCA, the PRA, the Singapore Attorney General’s Chambers, the Singapore Commercial Affairs Department, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. Group Inc. entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ, in which a charge against the firm, one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, was filed and will later be dismissed if the firm abides by the terms of the agreement. In addition, GS Malaysia pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA.\nThe firm has been working to secure necessary exemptions and authorizations from regulators so that these settlements do not impact the firm’s activities or the services that it provides to clients. In October 2020, the firm submitted its application to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to maintain its status as a qualified professional asset manager (QPAM) and in January 2021 the DOL published for public comment a notice of proposed exemption. The firm expects to obtain the exemption before the sentencing of GS Malaysia.\nThe firm has received multiple demands, beginning in November 2018, from alleged shareholders under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law for books and records relating to, among other things, the firm’s involvement with 1MDB and the firm’s compliance procedures. On December 13, 2019, an alleged shareholder filed a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware seeking books and records relating to, among other things, the firm’s involvement with 1MDB and the firm’s compliance procedures. The parties have agreed to stay proceedings pending resolution of the books and records demand.\nOn February 19, 2019, a purported shareholder derivative action relating to 1MDB was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Group Inc. and the directors at the time and a former chairman and chief executive officer of the firm. The second amended complaint filed on November 13, 2020, alleges breaches of fiduciary duties, including in connection with alleged insider trading by certain current and former directors, unjust enrichment and violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act, including in connection with Group Inc.’s common stock repurchases and solicitation of proxies and seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement and injunctive relief. Defendants moved to dismiss this action on January 15, 2021.\nBeginning in March 2019, the firm has also received demands from alleged shareholders to investigate and pursue claims against certain current and former directors and executive officers based on their oversight and public disclosures regarding 1MDB and related internal controls.\nOn December 20, 2018, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Group Inc. and certain former officers of the firm alleging violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act with respect to Group Inc.’s disclosures concerning 1MDB and seeking unspecified damages. The plaintiffs filed the second amended complaint on October 28, 2019, which the defendants moved to dismiss on January 9, 2020.\nMortgage-Related Matters\nBeginning in April 2010, a number of purported securities law class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York challenging the adequacy of Group Inc.’s public disclosure of, among other things, the firm’s activities in the collateralized debt obligation market, and the firm’s conflict of interest management.\nThe consolidated amended complaint filed on July 25, 2011, which named as defendants Group Inc. and certain current and former officers and employees of Group Inc. and its affiliates, generally alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and seeks monetary damages. The defendants have moved for summary judgment. On April 7, 2020, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s August 14, 2018 grant of class certification. On December 11, 2020, the United States Supreme Court granted defendants’ petition for writ of certiorari seeking review of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals’ April 7, 2020 decision.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nComplaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on July 25, 2019 and May 29, 2020 against Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company and GS Mortgage Securities Corp. by U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee for two residential mortgage-backed securitization trusts that issued $\n1.7\nbillion of securities. The complaints generally allege that mortgage loans in the trusts failed to conform to applicable representations and warranties and seek specific performance or, alternatively, compensatory damages and other relief. On November 23, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint in the first action and denied defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint in the second action. On January 14, 2021, amended complaints were filed in both actions.\nCurrencies-Related Litigation\nGS&Co. and Group Inc. are among the defendants named in putative class actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York beginning in September 2016 on behalf of putative indirect purchasers of foreign exchange instruments. On November 28, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a second-consolidated amended complaint generally alleging a conspiracy to manipulate the foreign currency exchange markets, asserting claims under various state antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws and seeking treble damages in an unspecified amount.

The firm has reserved the full amount of its contribution to the settlement.\nGS&Co. and Group Inc. are among the defendants named in an action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on November 7, 2018, and Group Inc., GSI, GSIB, GS&Co., Goldman Sachs Group UK Limited (GSG UK) and GS Bank USA are among the defendants named in an action filed in the High Court of England and Wales on November 11, 2020, in each case by certain direct purchasers of foreign exchange instruments that opted out of a class settlement reached with, among others, GS&Co. and Group Inc. The third amended complaint in the U.S. district court action, filed on August 3, 2020, generally alleges that the defendants violated federal antitrust law and state common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to manipulate the foreign currency exchange markets and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as unspecified amounts of compensatory, punitive, treble and other damages. The summary claim form filed in the U.K. action indicates the action is for breach of U.K. and E.U. competition rules from 2003 to 2013 and alleges manipulation of foreign exchange rates and bid/offer spreads, the exchange of commercially sensitive information among defendants and collusive trading.\nFinancial Advisory Services\nGroup Inc. and certain of its affiliates are from time to time parties to various civil litigation and arbitration proceedings and other disputes with clients and third parties relating to the firm’s financial advisory activities. These claims generally seek, among other things, compensatory damages and, in some cases, punitive damages, and in certain cases allege that the firm did not appropriately disclose or deal with conflicts of interest.\nUnderwriting Litigation\nFirm affiliates are among the defendants in a number of proceedings in connection with securities offerings. In these proceedings, including those described below, the plaintiffs assert class action or individual claims under federal and state securities laws and in some cases other applicable laws, allege that the offering documents for the securities that they purchased contained material misstatements and omissions, and generally seek compensatory and rescissory damages in unspecified amounts. Certain of these proceedings involve additional allegations.\nSunEdison, Inc.\nGS&Co. is among the underwriters named as defendants in several putative class actions and individual actions filed beginning in March 2016 relating to the August 2015 public offering of $\n650\nmillion of SunEdison, Inc.

The defendants have reached a settlement with certain plaintiffs in the individual actions and a settlement of the class action, which the court approved on October 25, 2019. The firm has paid the full amount of its contribution to the settlement. On December 31, 2020, the parties informed the court that they had reached an agreement in principle, subject to documentation, to resolve the remaining individual actions. The firm has reserved the full amount of its proposed contribution to the settlement.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

As of November 2004, this plan was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants.

Share-based awards that do not require future service (i.e., vested awards, including awards granted to retirement-eligible employees) are expensed immediately. Share-based awards that require future service are amortized over the relevant service period. Forfeitures are recorded when they occur.\nCash dividend equivalents paid on RSUs are generally charged to retained earnings. If RSUs that require future service are forfeited, the related dividend equivalents originally charged to retained earnings are reclassified to compensation expense in the period in which forfeiture occurs.\nThe firm generally issues new shares of common stock upon delivery of share-based awards. In certain cases, primarily related to conflicted employment (as outlined in the applicable award agreements), the firm may cash settle share-based compensation awards accounted for as equity instruments. For these awards, whose terms allow for cash settlement, additional\npaid-in\ncapital is adjusted to the extent of the difference between the value of the award at the time of cash settlement and the grant-date value of the award.\nStock Incentive Plan\nThe firm sponsors a stock incentive plan, The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (2018) (2018 SIP), which provides for grants of RSUs, restricted stock, dividend equivalent rights, incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other share-based awards, each of which may be subject to performance conditions. On May 2, 2018, shareholders approved the 2018 SIP. The 2018 SIP replaced The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (2015) (2015 SIP) previously in effect, and applies to awards granted on or after the date of approval. The 2015 SIP had previously replaced The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (2013) (2013 SIP).\nAs of December 2020,\n55.5\nmillion shares were available for grant under the 2018 SIP. If any shares of common stock underlying awards granted under the 2018 SIP, 2015 SIP or 2013 SIP are not delivered due to forfeiture, termination or cancellation or are surrendered or withheld, those shares will become available to be delivered under the 2018 SIP. Shares available for grant are also subject to adjustment for certain changes in corporate structure as permitted under the 2018 SIP. The 2018 SIP is scheduled to terminate on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders that occurs in 2022.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe firm grants RSUs (including RSUs subject to performance conditions) to employees, which are generally valued based on the closing price of the underlying shares on the date of grant after taking into account a liquidity discount for any applicable post-vesting and delivery transfer restrictions. RSUs generally vest and underlying shares of common stock deliver (net of required withholding tax) as outlined in the applicable award agreements.\nAward agreements generally provide that vesting is accelerated in certain circumstances, such as on retirement, death, disability and, in certain cases, conflicted employment. Delivery of the underlying shares of common stock is conditioned on the grantees satisfying certain vesting and other requirements outlined in the award agreements. RSUs not subject to performance conditions generally deliver over a three-year period. RSUs that are subject to performance conditions generally deliver after the end of a three-year performance period. For these awards, based on performance, the final award is adjusted from\nzero\nto\n150\n% of the original grant. Dividends that accrue during the performance period are paid at settlement.\nThe table below presents the 2020 activity related to stock settled RSUs.\nIn the table above:\nIn relation to\n2020 year-end,\nduring the first quarter of 2021, the firm granted to its employees\n9.0\nmillion RSUs, of which\n3.0\nmillion RSUs require future service as a condition of delivery for the related shares of common stock. These awards are subject to additional conditions as outlined in the award agreements. Generally, shares underlying these awards, net of required withholding tax, deliver over a three-year period, but are subject to post-vesting and delivery transfer restrictions through\nJanuary 2026\n. These grants are not included in the table above.\nAs of December 2020, there was $\n408\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to\nnon-vested\nshare-based compensation arrangements. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.69\nyears.\nStock Options\nStock options generally vested as outlined in the applicable stock option agreement. In general, options expired on the tenth anniversary of the grant date, although they may have been subject to earlier termination or cancellation under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the stock option agreement and the SIP in effect at the time of grant.\nThere were\nno\noptions outstanding as of both December 2020 and December 2019. During 2020 and 2019,\nno\noptions were exercised. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $\n288\nmillion during 2018.\nThe table below presents the share-based compensation and the related excess tax benefit.\nIn the table above, excess net tax benefit for share-based awards includes the net tax benefit on dividend equivalents paid on RSUs and the delivery of common stock underlying share-based awards, as well as the excess net tax benefit for options exercised.\nTHE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.
