The use of terms such as \"see\" or \"refer to\" shall be deemed to incorporate into this Item 1 the information to which such reference is made.\nEVERGY, INC.\nEvergy is a public utility holding company incorporated in 2017 and headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri.  Evergy operates primarily through the following wholly-owned direct subsidiaries listed below.\n•\nEvergy Kansas Central, Inc. (Evergy Kansas Central) is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Kansas.  Evergy Kansas Central has one active wholly-owned subsidiary with significant operations, Evergy Kansas South, Inc. (Evergy Kansas South).\n•\nEvergy Metro, Inc. (Evergy Metro) is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the states of Missouri and Kansas.\n•\nEvergy Missouri West, Inc. (Evergy Missouri West) is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Missouri.\n•\nEvergy Transmission Company, LLC (Evergy Transmission Company) owns 13.5% of Transource Energy, LLC (Transource) with the remaining 86.5% owned by AEP Transmission Holding Company, LLC, a subsidiary of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP).  Transource is focused on the development of competitive electric transmission projects.  Evergy Transmission Company accounts for its investment in Transource under the equity method.\nEvergy Kansas Central also owns a 50% interest in Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC (Prairie Wind), which is a joint venture between Evergy Kansas Central and subsidiaries of AEP and Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company.  Prairie Wind owns a 108-mile, 345 kilovolt (kV) double-circuit transmission line that provides transmission service in the Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP).  Evergy Kansas Central accounts for its investment in Prairie Wind under the equity method.\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Kansas South, Evergy Metro, and Evergy Missouri West conduct business in their respective service territories using the name Evergy.  The Evergy Companies assess financial performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis (i.e., operates in one segment).  Evergy serves approximately 1,620,400 customers located in Kansas and Missouri.  Customers include approximately 1,421,800 residences, 191,700 commercial firms and 6,900 industrials, municipalities and other electric utilities.  Evergy is significantly impacted by seasonality with approximately one-third of its retail revenues recorded in the third quarter.\n7\nThe table below summarizes the percentage of Evergy's revenues by customer classification.\nThe table below summarizes the percentage of Evergy's retail electricity sales by customer class.\nRegulation\nEvergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's Kansas operations are regulated by the State Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas (KCC) and Evergy Metro's Missouri operations and Evergy Missouri West are regulated by the Public Service Commission of the State of Missouri (MPSC), in each case with respect to retail rates, certain accounting matters, standards of service and, in certain cases, the issuance of securities, certification of facilities and service territories.  The Evergy Companies are also subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with respect to transmission, wholesale sales and rates and other matters.  Evergy has an indirect 94% ownership interest in Wolf Creek Generating Station (Wolf Creek), which is subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) with respect to licensing, operations and safety-related requirements.\nThe table below summarizes the rate orders in effect for Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's retail rate jurisdictions.\n(a)\nThe KCC establishes rates for Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Kansas South on a consolidated basis.\n(b)\nEvergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's current MPSC rate orders do not contain an allowed return on equity or rate-making equity ratio.\nEvergy expects its 2021 Kansas and Missouri jurisdictional retail revenues to be approximately 60% and 40%, respectively, based on historical averages of Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's total retail revenues.\nSee Item 7 MD&A, Critical Accounting Policies section, and Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning regulatory matters.\n8\nCompetition\nMissouri and Kansas continue to operate on the fully integrated and regulated retail utility model.  As a result, the Evergy Companies do not compete with others to supply and deliver electricity in their franchised service territories in exchange for agreeing to have their terms of service regulated by state regulatory bodies.  If Missouri or Kansas were to pass and implement legislation authorizing or mandating retail choice, Evergy may no longer be able to apply regulated utility accounting principles to deregulated portions of its operations, which may require a surcharge to recover certain costs from legacy customers or could lead to a write-off of certain regulatory assets and liabilities.\nEvergy competes in the wholesale market to sell power in circumstances when the power it generates is not required for retail customers in its service territory.  This competition primarily occurs within the SPP Integrated Marketplace, in which Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are participants.  This marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run, within the operating constraints of a unit, at any given time for maximum regional cost-effectiveness.\nThe SPP Integrated Marketplace is similar to other Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) or Independent System Operator (ISO) markets currently operating in other regions of the United States.\nPower Supply\nEvergy has approximately 15,400 megawatts (MWs) of owned generating capacity and renewable power purchase agreements.  Evergy's owned generation and power purchases from others, as a percentage of total megawatt hours (MWhs) generated and purchased, was approximately 70% and 30%, respectively, over the last three years.  Evergy purchases power to meet its customers' needs, to satisfy firm power commitments or to meet renewable energy standards.  Management believes Evergy will be able to meet its future power purchase needs due to the coordination of planning and operations in the SPP region and existing power purchase agreements; however, price and availability of power purchases may be impacted during periods of high demand.\nEvergy's total capacity by fuel type, including both owned generating capacity and power purchase agreements, is detailed in the table below.\n(a)\nMWs are based on nameplate capacity of the wind facility.  Includes owned generating capacity of 579 MWs and long-term power purchase agreements of approximately 3,760 MWs of wind generation that expire from 2028 through 2048.  See Item 2, Properties, for additional information.\n(b)\nIncludes a long-term power purchase agreement for approximately 60 MWs of hydroelectric generation that expires in 2023.\nEvergy's projected peak summer demand for 2021 is approximately 10,300 MWs.  Evergy expects to meet its projected capacity requirements for 2021 with its existing generation assets and power purchases.  See \"Transforming Evergy's Generation Fleet\" for further information regarding Evergy's long-term strategy with regards to its generating assets and power purchases.\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are members of the SPP.  The SPP is a FERC-approved RTO with the responsibility to ensure reliable power supply, adequate transmission infrastructure and competitive wholesale electricity prices in the region.  As SPP members, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are required to maintain a minimum reserve margin of 12%.  This net positive supply of capacity is maintained through generation asset ownership, capacity agreements, power purchase agreements and\n9\npeak demand reduction programs.  The reserve margin is designed to support reliability of the region's electric supply.\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Evergy Companies are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements relating to air and water quality, waste management and hazardous substance disposal, protected natural resources (such as wetlands, endangered species and other protected wildlife) and health and safety.  For example, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West combust large amounts of fossil fuels in the production of electricity, which results in significant emissions of carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n) and other greenhouse gases (GHG).  Federal legislation regulates the emission of GHGs and numerous states and regions have adopted programs to stabilize or reduce GHG emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) regulate emissions under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA), water under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and waste management under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), among other laws and regulations. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.  There have been, and management believes there will continue to be, policy, legal and regulatory efforts to influence climate change, such as efforts to reduce GHG emissions, impose a tax on emissions and create incentives for low-carbon generation and energy efficiency.  These efforts, and climate change itself, have the potential to adversely affect the Evergy Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information.\nThe Evergy Companies have taken, and will continue to take, proactive measures to mitigate the impact of climate change on its businesses.  For example, the Evergy Companies regularly conduct preparedness exercises for a variety of disruptive events, including storms, which may become more frequent or intense due to climate change.  In addition, the Evergy Companies have invested, and will continue to invest, in grid resiliency.  Much of the Evergy Companies' infrastructure is aged, and grid resiliency efforts include building additional transmission and distribution lines, replacing aged infrastructure and proactively managing the vegetation that can damage systems during severe weather.  The Evergy Companies also monitor water conditions at their generating facilities and focus on water conservation at these facilities to address resource depletion.\nTransforming Evergy's Generation Fleet\nThe Evergy Companies are committed to a long-term strategy to reduce CO\n2\nemissions in a cost-effective and reliable manner.  In 2020, Evergy achieved a reduction of CO\n2\nemissions of approximately 50% from 2005 levels and announced a goal to achieve an 80% reduction from 2005 levels by 2050.  In August 2020, Evergy also announced a five-year Sustainability Transformation Plan (STP), which seeks to optimize and enhance value creation for stakeholders and has the potential to reduce CO\n2\nemissions by as much as 85% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.  The STP includes steps that would expedite CO\n2\nemission reductions by pursuing constructive legislative and regulatory recovery mechanisms to facilitate the retirement of coal-fired generation and expansion of Evergy's wind and solar footprint, while maintaining reliability.  The pace of CO\n2\nemission reductions will ultimately be defined by continued collaboration with stakeholders as part of Evergy's triennial integrated resource plan.  Further, the trajectory and timing for reaching this goal could be impacted by political, legal and regulatory actions and applicable technology developments.  See Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) - Executive Summary - Strategy, for additional information regarding the STP.\nPublic attention is currently focused on transitioning to a low carbon future, including reducing GHG emissions and closing coal-fired generating units.  Diversity of fuel supply has historically provided cost and reliability benefits.  For example, because renewable generation is intermittent, diversity of baseload generation, including a mix of coal and natural gas, has helped to maintain a consistent availability of power.  In addition, the Evergy Companies must prudently utilize the generation assets that regulators have allowed the Evergy Companies to include in rates.  The Evergy Companies use a triennial integrated resource plan, which is a detailed analysis that estimates factors that influence the future supply and demand for electricity, to inform the manner in which they supply electricity.  The integrated resource plan considers forecasts of future electricity demand, fuel prices, transmission improvements, new generating capacity, cost of environmental compliance, integration of renewables, energy storage, energy\n10\nefficiency and demand response initiatives.  Strategies that the Evergy Companies are pursuing to reduce emissions include:\n•\nretiring fossil fuel generation;\n•\ndeveloping renewable energy facilities;\n•\ncollaborating with regulators to offer customers the opportunity to procure electricity produced with renewable resources; and\n•\ninvesting in customer energy efficiency programs.\nSince 2005, the Evergy Companies have added over 4,400 MWs of renewables, while retiring more than 2,400 MWs of fossil generation.  The Evergy Companies are also committed to transparency.  On its website, www.evergy.com, Evergy provides quantitative and qualitative data regarding various environmental, social and governance matters, including information related to emissions, waste and water.  The contents of the website, including reports and documents contained therein, are not incorporated into this filing.\nSee Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters.\nFuel\nThe fuel sources for Evergy's owned generation and power purchase agreements are coal, wind and other renewable sources, uranium and natural gas and oil.  The actual 2020 fuel mix and fuel cost in cents per net kilowatt hour (kWh) delivered are outlined in the following table.\n(a)\nFuel mix based on percent of net MWhs generated by owned resources and delivered under renewable power purchase agreements.\n(b)\nFuel cost in cents per net kWh delivered includes costs associated with renewable power purchase agreements.\nCoal\nDuring 2021, Evergy's generating units, including jointly-owned units, are projected to use approximately 18 million tons of coal.  Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have entered into coal-purchase contracts with various suppliers in Wyoming's Powder River Basin (PRB), the nation's principal supply region of low-sulfur coal, and with local suppliers.  The coal to be provided under these contracts is expected to satisfy approximately 60% of the projected coal requirements for 2021 and approximately 10% for 2022.  The remainder of the coal requirements is expected to be fulfilled through entering into additional contracts or spot market purchases.\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have also entered into rail transportation contracts with various railroads to transport coal from the PRB and local suppliers to their generating units.  The transportation services to be provided under these contracts are expected to satisfy almost all of the projected transportation requirements for 2021 and approximately 80% for 2022.  The contract rates adjust for changes in railroad costs.\n11\nNuclear Fuel\nEvergy Kansas South and Evergy Metro each owns 47% of Wolf Creek, which is Evergy's only nuclear generating unit.  Wolf Creek purchases uranium and has it processed for use as fuel in its reactor.  This process involves conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride, enrichment of uranium hexafluoride and fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies.  The owners of Wolf Creek have on hand or under contract all of the uranium, uranium enrichment and conversion services needed to operate Wolf Creek through the first quarter of 2027.  The owners also have under contract all of the uranium fabrication services required to operate Wolf Creek through the third quarter of 2028.\nNatural Gas\nEvergy purchases natural gas for use in its generating units primarily through spot market purchases.  From time to time, Evergy also may enter into contracts, including the use of derivatives, in an effort to manage the cost of natural gas.  For additional information about Evergy's exposure to commodity price risks, see Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nEvergy Kansas Central maintains natural gas transportation arrangements with Kansas Gas Service and Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline.  The Kansas Gas Service arrangement has historically expired on April 30 of each year and is renegotiated for an additional one-year term.  The Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline arrangement expires based on the generating unit being served with expiration dates from 2022 to 2030.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2020, the Evergy Companies had 5,133 employees, including 2,808 represented by five local unions of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and one local union of the United Government Security Officers of America (UGSOA).  The Evergy Companies currently have labor agreements with each of these unions that expire at varying times in 2021 and 2022.  The Evergy Companies employ 1,684 generation employees, 1,383 transmission and distribution employees and 2,066 support employees that work in the states of Kansas and Missouri.\nEvergy's mission is to empower a better future and a key component of this mission is maintaining a culture that emphasizes safety, integrity, ownership and adaptability.\nSafety is a crucial part of Evergy's values.  The components of Evergy's safety program include a strong management commitment to a safety-conscious work environment, hazard recognition and control, worksite analysis, contractor safety management and training.  Evergy also places a significant emphasis on continuous improvement through conducting regular safety audits and assessments.  For example, Evergy's 2020 annual cash incentive program included a metric that is based on the number of days of work missed due to preventable injury.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, Evergy has prioritized the safety of its employees while continuing to serve its customers and community by providing appropriate personal protective equipment, establishing additional training and protocols and directing employees to work remotely when possible.\nEvergy is also working to build a more diverse and inclusive workforce through recruiting and hiring practices, performance management, training and data analysis and reporting initiatives.  As of December 31, 2020, Evergy's workforce was 77% male and 23% female, and women represented 21% of Evergy's officer team.  The ethnicity of Evergy's workforce was 85% White, 5% Black, 4% Hispanic and 6% other.  Evergy also has a Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion that reports directly to Evergy's President and Chief Executive Officer.\nEvergy offers a competitive package of compensation and benefits to attract and retain talented employees, including market-competitive pay, healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time off, family leave and tuition reimbursement.  Evergy also allows employees to participate in a comprehensive well-being program that includes health and wellness-related incentives, business resource groups, gym membership reimbursement and access to an employee assistance program.\n12\nInformation About Evergy's Executive Officers\nSet forth below is information relating to the executive officers of Evergy, Inc.

    "text": "Utility Regulatory Risks:\nPrices are established by regulators and may not be sufficient to result in a recovery of costs or provide for a return on investment.\nThe prices that the FERC, KCC and MPSC authorize the utility subsidiaries of Evergy to charge significantly influence the Evergy Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIn general, utilities are allowed to recover in customer rates costs that were prudently incurred to provide utility service, plus a reasonable return on invested capital.  There can be no assurance, however, that regulators will determine costs to have been prudently incurred.  Further, the amounts approved by the regulators may not be sufficient to allow for a recovery of costs or provide for an adequate return on and of capital investments.  Also, amounts that were approved by regulators may be appealed, modified, limited or eliminated by subsequent regulatory or legislative actions.  A failure to recover costs or earn a reasonable return on invested capital could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Evergy and its utility subsidiaries.\nThe Evergy Companies are also exposed to cost-recovery shortfalls due to the inherent \"regulatory lag\" in the rate-setting process.  This is because utility rates are generally based on historical information and, except for certain situations where regulators allow for recovery of expenses through use of a formula that tracks costs, are not subject to adjustment between rate cases.  In connection with the merger, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro agreed to a five-year base rate moratorium in Kansas beginning in December 2018.  In addition, effective as of January 1, 2019, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West elected into plant-in service accounting (PISA), which, by law, requires each company to keep base rates constant for three years following Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's last general rate case and limits the extent to which prices can increase thereafter.  These and other factors may result in under-recovery of costs or failure to earn the authorized return on investment, or both.\nFailure to timely recover the full investment costs of capital projects, the impact of renewable energy and energy efficiency programs, other utility costs and expenses due to regulatory disallowances, regulatory lag or other factors could lead to lowered credit ratings, reduced access to capital markets, increased financing costs, lower flexibility due to constrained financial resources and increased collateral security requirements or reductions or delays in planned capital expenditures.  In response to competitive, economic, political, legislative, public perception and regulatory pressures, Evergy's utility subsidiaries may be subject to rate moratoriums, rate refunds, limits on rate increases, lower allowed returns on investments or rate reductions, including phase-in plans designed to spread the impact of rate increases over an extended period for the benefit of customers.  Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Evergy Companies.\nLegislative and regulatory requirements may increase costs and result in compliance penalties.\nFERC, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and SPP have implemented and enforce an extensive set of transmission system reliability, cybersecurity and critical infrastructure protection standards that apply to public utilities.  The MPSC and KCC have the authority to implement utility operational standards and requirements, such as vegetation management standards, facilities inspection requirements and quality of service standards.  In addition, Evergy is also subject to health, safety and other requirements enacted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Labor and other federal and state agencies.  As discussed more fully below, the Evergy Companies are also subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, as well as laws and regulations related to nuclear power generation.  The costs of complying with existing, new or modified regulations, standards and other requirements could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies.  Furthermore, regulatory changes could result in operational changes that increase costs or adversely impact the Evergy Companies' prospects.  In addition, failure to meet quality of service, reliability, cybersecurity, critical infrastructure protection, operational or other standards and requirements could expose the Evergy Companies to penalties, additional\n16\ncompliance costs or adverse rate consequences, any of which could have a material adverse impact on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nEnvironmental Risks:\nCosts to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to GHG emissions, are significant and may adversely impact operations and financial results.\nThe Evergy Companies are subject to extensive and evolving federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements relating to air and water quality, waste management and hazardous substance disposal, protected natural resources (such as wetlands, endangered species and other protected wildlife) and health and safety.  See Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCompliance with these laws, regulations and requirements requires significant capital and operating resources, and the failure to comply could result in substantial fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions.  In addition, there is a risk of lawsuits alleging violations of environmental laws, regulations or requirements, claiming creation of a public nuisance or other matters, and seeking injunctions or monetary damages or other relief.\nEnvironmental permits are subject to periodic renewal, which may result in more stringent permit conditions and limits.  New facilities, or modifications of existing facilities, may require new environmental permits or amendments to existing permits.  Delays in the environmental permitting process, public opposition and challenges, denials of permit applications, limits or conditions imposed in permits and the associated uncertainty may materially adversely affect the cost and timing of projects, and thus materially adversely affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies.  In addition, compliance with environmental laws, regulations and requirements could alter the way assets are managed, which in turn could result in retiring assets earlier than expected, recording asset retirement obligations (AROs) or having a regulator disallow recovery of costs that had been prudently incurred in connection with those assets.\nCosts of compliance with environmental laws, regulations and requirements, or fines, penalties or negative lawsuit outcomes, if not recovered in rates from customers, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies.\nFinancial Risks:\nFinancial market disruptions or declines in the Evergy Companies' credit ratings may increase financing costs and limit access to the credit markets, which may adversely affect liquidity and financial results.\nThe Evergy Companies rely on funds from operations and access to the capital and credit markets to fund capital expenditures and for working capital and liquidity.  Disruption in capital or credit markets, increases in interest rates, deterioration in the financial condition of the financial institutions on which the Evergy Companies rely, credit rating downgrades, a decrease in the market price of Evergy's common stock or a decrease or disappearance in the demand for debt securities issued by the Evergy Companies or subsidiaries could have material adverse effects on the Evergy Companies.  These effects could include, among others: reduced access to capital and increased cost of borrowed funds and collateral requirements; dilution resulting from equity issuances at reduced prices; increased nuclear decommissioning trust and pension and other post-retirement benefit plan funding requirements; reduced ability to pay dividends; rate case disallowance of costs of capital; reductions in or delays of capital expenditures; and limitations in the ability of Evergy to provide credit support for its subsidiaries.\nThe STP includes an increase in targeted capital investments to enhance the customer experience, improve reliability and resiliency and improve efficiency, which are expected to be funded with cash flows from operations and debt.  If cash flows from operations are lower than expected, additional debt will be required to fund the investments, which, in turn, may create pressure on the Evergy Companies' credit ratings or result in a ratings downgrade and increase their cost of capital.  Further, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro have outstanding tax-exempt bonds that may be put back to the respective issuer at the option of the holders, which could adversely\n17\nimpact liquidity.  In addition, market disruption and volatility could have an adverse impact on Evergy's lenders, suppliers and other counterparties or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations.\nEvergy is a holding company and relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations.\nEvergy is a holding company with no significant operations of its own.  The primary source of funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders and its other financial obligations is dividends paid to it by its direct subsidiaries, particularly Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West.  Evergy's subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide Evergy with funds.  The ability of Evergy's subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions, and accordingly, Evergy's ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its financial obligations, principally depends on the earnings and cash flows, capital requirements and general financial position of its subsidiaries, as well as regulatory factors, financial covenants, general business conditions and other matters.\nIn addition, the Evergy Companies are subject to certain corporate and regulatory restrictions and financial covenants that could affect their ability to pay dividends.  Under the Federal Power Act, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West generally can pay dividends only out of retained earnings.  Each of Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West has committed to Missouri regulators to not pay dividends to Evergy if its credit rating falls below BBB- for S&P Global Ratings or Baa3 for Moody's Investor Services.  Each of Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro has committed to Kansas regulators to not pay dividends to Evergy if (i) the payment would result in an increase in the utility's debt level (excluding short-term debt and debt due within one year) above 60 percent of its total capitalization, absent approval from the KCC or (ii) if its credit rating falls below BBB- for S&P Global Ratings or Baa3 for Moody's Investor Services.  Under various debt agreements, the Evergy Companies are also required to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization ratio of not more than 0.65 to 1.00, which could restrict the amount of dividends the Evergy Companies are permitted to pay.  Evergy cannot guarantee dividends will be paid in the future or that, if paid, dividends will satisfy announced targets or investor expectations or be paid with the same frequency as in the past.\nIn addition, from time to time Evergy may guarantee debt obligations of its subsidiaries.  Under the financing agreements to which Evergy is a party, a guarantee of debt may be considered indebtedness for purposes of complying with financial covenants that dictate the extent to which Evergy can borrow money, and any guarantee payments could adversely affect Evergy's liquidity and ability to service its own debt obligations.\nIncreasing costs associated with defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans, health care plans and other employee benefits could adversely affect Evergy's financial position and liquidity.\nEvergy maintains defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement employee benefit plans for certain current and former employees.  The costs of these plans depend on a number of factors, including the rates of return on plan assets, the level and nature of the provided benefits, discount rates, the interest rates used to measure required minimum funding levels, changes in benefit design, changes in laws or regulations and the amount of any required or voluntary contributions to the plans.  The Evergy Companies have substantial unfunded liabilities under these plans.  Also, if the rate of retirements exceeds planned levels, these plans experience adverse market returns on investments or interest rates fall, required or voluntary contributions to the plans could be material.  In addition, changes in accounting rules and assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions, including projected retirements, could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies.\nThe costs of providing health care benefits to employees and retirees have increased in recent years and may continue to rise in the future.  Future legislative changes related to health care could also cause significant changes to benefit programs and costs.  The increasing costs associated with health care plans could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies.\nThe Evergy Companies are subject to commodity and other risks associated with energy markets.\nThe Evergy Companies are required to maintain generation capacity that satisfies regulatory mandates and are obligated to provide power when required by the SPP or pursuant to contractual obligations.  Although the Evergy Companies generally have regulatory mechanisms that allow them to recover the cost of fuel and purchased power\n18\nnecessary to satisfy these requirements, regulatory or legislative actions could limit, eliminate or delay recovery of these expenses after the expenses have been incurred.\nThe Evergy Companies engage in the wholesale and retail sale of electricity as part of their regulated electric operations in addition to limited energy marketing activities and the management of third-party generation facilities.  These activities expose the Evergy Companies to risks associated with the price of electricity and other energy-related products, as well credit exposure to their counterparties.  Exposure to these risks is affected by a number of factors, including the availability and cost of fuel and power that the Evergy Companies may purchase on the wholesale markets to satisfy their regulatory or contractual obligations, the ability or effectiveness of strategies utilized by the Evergy Companies to hedge these risks, the extent to which the Evergy Companies may be required to post collateral for the benefit of third parties and the risk that counterparties fail to fulfill their obligations to the Evergy Companies.  Market volatility can increase or create unanticipated risks.  Regional transmission organizations and independent system operators may also retroactively reprice transactions following execution.\nSubject to certain regulatory constraints, the Evergy Companies use derivative instruments, such as transmission congestion rights (TCRs), swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage commodity and financial risks.  Losses could be recognized as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts, if a counterparty fails to perform or if the underlying transactions, which the derivative instruments are intended to hedge, fail to materialize.  The valuation of these financial instruments can involve management’s judgment or the use of estimates.  As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.  The Evergy Companies cannot assure that their risk management practices will be effective or will mitigate all risks.\nThe results of operations, financial position and liquidity of the Evergy Companies could be materially adversely affected if the Evergy Companies fail to recover, or experience a delay in the recovery of, fuel and purchased power expenses; if the Evergy Companies fail to adequately hedge or mitigate commodity or energy market risks; if the Evergy Companies are required to provide collateral in amounts greater than planned; if energy marketing transactions are retroactively repriced; or if counterparties fail to fulfill obligations to the Evergy Companies.\nTax legislation and an inability to utilize tax credits could adversely impact results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nTax laws and regulations can adversely affect, among other things, financial results, liquidity, credit ratings and the valuation of assets, such as deferred income tax assets. The Evergy Companies regularly assess their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of net operating loss (NOL), tax credit and other tax carryforwards, that are recorded as deferred income tax assets on its balance sheets to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary.  A reduction in, or disallowance of, these tax benefits could have an adverse impact on the financial results and liquidity of the Evergy Companies.\nAdditionally, changes in corporate tax rates or policy changes, as well as any inability to generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all tax benefits before they expire, could have an adverse impact on the results of operations, financial position and liquidity of the Evergy Companies.  For example, prior to the U.S. presidential election, President Biden proposed increasing the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28% and imposing an alternative minimum tax (AMT) on book income, among other things, and these or similar proposals, if enacted into law, could impact the Evergy Companies' effective tax rate.  In addition, the Evergy Companies construct and operate renewable energy facilities that generate tax credits that reduce federal income tax obligations. The amount of tax credits is dependent on several factors, including the amount of electricity produced and the applicable tax credit rate. A variety of factors, including transmission constraints, the ability to timely complete construction of renewable energy facilities, adverse weather conditions and breakdown or failure of equipment, could significantly reduce these tax credits, which could have an adverse impact on the results of operations and financial position of the Evergy Companies.\nThe anticipated benefits of the Evergy Companies' strategy may not be realized.\nThe STP includes planned reductions in operating and maintenance expense and planned increases in capital investments.  The STP also includes pursuing statutory and regulatory mechanisms to facilitate the retirement of\n19\ncoal-fired generation and expansion of the Evergy Companies' wind and solar footprint.  If regulators determine that the retirement of coal generation facilities was not prudent, they could prohibit the Evergy Companies from recovering, or earning a return on, the investments in those facilities that were prudent when the investments were originally made.  This concept is known as a \"stranded asset,\" and generation retirements outside of those contemplated in the integrated resource plan increase the risk that regulators will disallow the recovery of otherwise prudent investments.\nSee Part II, Item 7, MD&A - Executive Summary - Strategy, for additional information regarding the STP.  The risks described elsewhere in Item 1A – Risk Factors apply to the STP.  No assurance can be given that the Evergy Companies will be successful in implementing their strategy in a timely manner or at all, and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies and have an adverse impact on the price of Evergy’s common stock.\nThe price of Evergy common stock may experience volatility.\nThe price of Evergy common stock may be volatile.  Some of the factors that could affect the price of Evergy common stock are Evergy's earnings; the ability of the Evergy Companies to implement their strategic plan; the ability of Evergy to deploy capital; actions by regulators; and statements in the press or investment community about the Evergy Companies' strategy, earnings per share or growth prospects, financial condition or results of operations.  Negative perceptions or publicity from increasing scrutiny of environmental, social and governance practices could also adversely impact Evergy's stock price. Also, individuals or entities, such as activist shareholders and special interest groups, may seek to influence the Evergy Companies' strategic plan or take other actions that could disrupt the Evergy Companies' business, financial results or operations and could adversely impact Evergy's stock price.  In addition, the Evergy Companies operate almost exclusively in Kansas and Missouri and this concentration may increase exposure to risks arising from unique local or regional factors.  Furthermore, general market conditions and U.S. economic factors and political events unrelated to the performance of Evergy (including the COVID-19 pandemic) may also affect Evergy's stock price.  For these reasons, shareholders should not rely on historical trends in the price of  Evergy common stock to predict the future price of Evergy's common stock.\nEvergy has recorded goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect financial results\n.\nAs required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Evergy recorded a significant amount of goodwill on its balance sheet in connection with completion of the merger that resulted in the formation of Evergy.  Evergy assesses goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate a potential for impairment.  If goodwill is deemed to be impaired, Evergy may be required to incur non-cash charges that could materially adversely affect its results of operations.\nCustomer and Weather-Related Risks:\nChanges in electricity consumption could have a material adverse effect on Evergy's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nChange in customer behaviors in response to energy efficiency programs, changing conditions and preferences or changes in the adoption of technologies could affect the consumption of energy by customers.  Federal and state programs exist to influence the way customers use energy and regulators have mandates to promote energy efficiency.  Conservation programs and customers' level of participation in the programs could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies.\nTechnological advances, energy efficiency and other energy conservation measures have reduced and will continue to reduce customer electricity consumption.  The Evergy Companies generate electricity at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce electricity at a competitive cost.  Self-generation and distributed generation technologies, including microturbines, wind turbines, fuel cells and solar cells, as well as those related to the storage of energy produced by these systems, have become economically competitive with the manner and price at which the Evergy Companies sell electricity.  There is also a perception that generating or storing electricity through these technologies is more environmentally friendly than generating electricity with fossil fuels.  Increased\n20\nadoption of these technologies could reduce electricity demand and the pool of customers from whom fixed costs are recovered, resulting in under recovery of the fixed costs of the Evergy Companies.  Increased self-generation and the related use of net energy metering, which allows self-generating customers to receive bill credits for surplus power, could put upward price pressure on remaining customers.  If the Evergy Companies are unable to adjust to reduced electricity demand and increased self-generation and net energy metering, their financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nChanges in customer electricity consumption due to sustained financial market disruptions, downturns or sluggishness in the economy or other factors may also adversely affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies.\nWeather is a major driver of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies and the Evergy Companies are subject to risks associated with climate change.\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for and price of electricity.  The Evergy Companies are significantly impacted by seasonality, and, due to energy demand created by air conditioning load, highest revenues are typically recorded in the third quarter.  Unusually mild winter or summer weather can adversely affect sales.  In addition, severe weather and events, including tornados, snow, fire, rain, flooding and ice storms, can be destructive and cause outages and property damage that can result in increased expenses, lower revenues and additional restoration costs.  Storm reserves established by the Evergy Companies may be insufficient and rates may not be adjusted in a timely manner, or at all, to recover these costs.  Additionally, because many of the Evergy Companies' generating stations utilize water for cooling, low water and flow levels can increase maintenance costs at these stations, result in limited power production and require modifications to plant operations.  High water conditions can also impair planned deliveries of fuel to generating stations or otherwise adversely impact the ability of the Evergy Companies to operate these stations.  Climate change may produce more frequent or severe weather events, such as storms, droughts or floods and could also impact the economic health of the Evergy Companies' service territories.  An increase in the frequency or severity of extreme weather events or a deterioration in the economic health of Evergy's service territories could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies.\nIn addition, policy, legal and regulatory efforts to influence climate change, such as efforts to reduce GHG emissions, impose a tax on emissions and create incentives for low-carbon generation and energy efficiency, could result in reduced sales and require significant costs to respond to such efforts.  These efforts could also result in the early retirement of generation facilities, which could result in stranded costs if regulators disallow recovery of investments that were prudent when originally made.  The Evergy Companies announced a goal in 2020 to achieve an 80% reduction of CO\n2\nemissions from 2005 levels by 2050 and the STP has the potential to reduce CO\n2\nemissions by as much as 85% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.  The trajectory and timing of the goal could be impacted by many external factors, including national and state energy policies; legal and regulatory matters; stakeholder input into the Evergy Companies' integrated resource plan; the development, deployment and advancement of relevant energy technologies; and other factors.  Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies and the market prices of Evergy's common stock.\nOperational Risks:\nOperational risks may adversely affect the Evergy Companies.\nThe operation of electric generation, transmission, distribution and information systems involves many risks, including breakdown or failure of equipment; aging infrastructure; operator error or contractor or subcontractor failure; problems that delay or increase the cost of returning facilities to service after outages; limitations that may be imposed by equipment conditions or environmental, safety or other regulatory requirements; fuel supply or fuel transportation reductions or interruptions; labor disputes; difficulties with the implementation or operation of information systems; transmission scheduling constraints; and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, droughts, explosions, terrorism, severe weather, pandemics or other similar occurrences.  Many of the Evergy Companies' generation, transmission and distribution resources are aged, which increases the risk of unplanned outages, reduced\n21\ngeneration output and higher maintenance expense.  Any equipment or system outage or constraint can, among other things, reduce sales, increase costs and affect the ability to meet regulatory service metrics, customer expectations and regulatory reliability and security requirements.\nThe Evergy Companies have general liability and property insurance to cover a portion of their facilities, but such policies do not cover transmission or distribution systems, are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage.  Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at reasonable costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage.\nThese and other operating events may reduce revenues or increase costs, or both, and may materially affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies.\nPhysical and cybersecurity breaches, criminal activity, terrorist attacks and other disruptions to facilities or information technology infrastructure could interfere with operations, expose the Evergy Companies or their customers or employees to a risk of loss, expose the Evergy Companies to legal or regulatory liability and cause reputational and other harm.\nThe Evergy Companies rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, supply chain functions and the invoicing and collection of payments from customers.  The Evergy Companies also use information technology networks and systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting, legal and tax requirements.  These networks and systems are in some cases owned or managed by third-party service providers.  In the ordinary course of business, the Evergy Companies collect, store and transmit sensitive data including operating information, proprietary business information and personal information belonging to customers and employees.\nThe Evergy Companies' information technology networks and infrastructure, as well as the networks and infrastructure belonging to third-party service providers are vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks or breaches by hackers or other unauthorized third parties; error or malfeasance by one or more employees or service providers; software or hardware upgrades; additions or replacements; malicious software code; telecommunication failures; natural disasters or other catastrophic events.  The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way the Evergy Companies operate and has increased the use of technology to enable remote-working arrangements, which may increase or expose previously unknown vulnerabilities.  Public reports have indicated an increase in cyberattacks in general since the start of the pandemic due, in part, to the increase in the number of employees working remotely and the proliferation of the different ways in which employees and third parties interact with the Evergy Companies' information technology infrastructure.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could, among other things, impact the reliability or safety of the Evergy Companies' generation, transmission and distribution systems; result in the erasure of data or render the Evergy Companies' equipment, or the equipment of third-party service providers, unusable; impact the Evergy Companies' ability to conduct business in the ordinary course; reduce sales; expose the Evergy Companies and their customers, employees and vendors to a risk of loss or misuse of information; and result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties, damage the Evergy Companies' reputation or otherwise harm their business.  The Evergy Companies can provide no assurance that they will be able to identify and remediate all security or system vulnerabilities or that unauthorized access or error will be identified and remediated.\nThe Evergy Companies are subject to laws and rules issued by multiple government agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of their security, customer and business information.  For example, NERC has issued comprehensive regulations and standards surrounding the security of bulk power systems and is continually in the process of developing updates and new requirements with which the utility industry must comply.  The NRC also has issued regulations and standards related to the protection of critical digital assets at nuclear power plants.  Compliance with NERC and NRC rules and standards, and rules and standards promulgated by other regulatory agencies from time to time or future legislation, will increase the Evergy Companies' compliance costs\n22\nand their exposure to the potential risk of violations of these rules, standards or future legislation, which includes potential financial penalties.  Furthermore, the non-compliance of other utilities with applicable regulations or the occurrence of a serious security event at other utilities could result in increased regulation or oversight, both of which could increase the Evergy Companies' costs and impact their financial results.\nAdditionally, the Evergy Companies cannot predict the impact that any future information technology or malicious attack may have on the energy industry in general.  The electric utility industry, both within the United States and internationally, has experienced physical and cybersecurity attacks on energy infrastructure such as power plants, substations and related assets in the past, and there will likely be more attacks in the future.  The Evergy Companies' facilities and systems could be direct targets or indirect casualties of such attacks.  The effects of such attacks could include disruption to the Evergy Companies' generation, transmission and distribution systems or to the electrical grid in general, reduced sales and could increase the cost of insurance coverage or result in a decline in the U.S. economy.  Furthermore, insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses.  Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on the Evergy Companies' results of operations or financial position.\nThe cost and schedule of capital projects may materially change and expected performance may not be achieved.\nThe Evergy Companies' business is capital intensive and includes significant construction projects.  The risks of any capital project include: actual costs may exceed estimated costs; regulators may disallow, limit or delay the recovery of all or part of the cost of, or a return on, a capital project; risks associated with the capital and credit markets to fund projects; delays in receiving, or failure to receive, necessary permits, approvals and other regulatory authorizations; unforeseen engineering problems or changes in project design or scope; the failure of suppliers and contractors to perform as required under their contracts; inadequate availability or increased cost of labor or materials, including commodities such as steel, copper and aluminum that may be subject to uncertain or increased tariffs; inclement weather; new or changed laws, regulations and requirements, including environmental and health and safety laws, regulations and requirements; and other events beyond the Evergy Companies' control may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost and performance of these projects.\nThe STP includes an increase in targeted capital investments.  The Evergy Companies' ability to implement the investments contemplated in the STP depend, in part, on the availability of adequate internal and external resources, such as employees and qualified contractors and the availability of materials.  In this regard, the global COVID-19 pandemic has caused and continues to cause disruptions to the global supply chain and the availability of qualified labor.\nThese and other risks could cause the Evergy Companies to defer or limit capital expenditures, materially increase the costs of capital projects, delay the in-service dates of projects, adversely affect the performance of the projects and require the purchase of electricity on the wholesale market, at potentially more expensive prices, until the projects are completed.  These risks may significantly affect the Evergy Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce and to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements could negatively impact the Evergy Companies' business and operations and adversely impact the Evergy Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Evergy Companies' workforce includes professional, managerial and technical employees, and a failure to attract and retain qualified talent, or retirements without adequate replacements or adjustments to the Evergy Companies' strategy, could adversely impact the Evergy Companies' ability to execute on their strategy.  For example, certain skills, such as those related to construction, maintenance and repair of transmission and distribution systems are in high demand and have a limited supply, and Evergy competes for qualified employees with these skills on a national level.\nA significant portion of the Evergy Companies' workforce is represented by five local unions of the IBEW and one local union of the UGSOA.  The collective bargaining agreements with the five IBEW locals all expire in 2021 and the collective bargaining agreement with the UGSOA expires in 2022.  A failure to successfully negotiate these collective bargaining agreements could result in a labor disruption and have a significant adverse impact on the Evergy Companies' operations and results of operations.\n23\nThe STP includes enhanced technology and transmission and distribution investments and a reduction in reliance on coal-fired generation.  The Evergy Companies will need to attract and retain personnel that are qualified to implement the Evergy Companies' strategy and may need to retrain or reskill certain employees to support the Evergy Companies' long-term objectives.  A failure to attract and retain qualified employees, retrain or reskill existing employees and maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of the Evergy Companies.\nThe Evergy Companies are exposed to risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit, which could adversely impact the Evergy Companies' business and financial results.\nEvergy indirectly owns 94% of Wolf Creek, with Evergy Kansas South and Evergy Metro each owning 47% of the nuclear plant.  The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities, including Wolf Creek.  In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, shut down the facilities, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved.  Additionally, the non-compliance of other nuclear facility operators with applicable regulations or the occurrence of a serious nuclear incident anywhere in the world could result in increased regulation of the nuclear industry.  Such events could increase Wolf Creek's costs and impact the financial results of the Evergy Companies or result in a shutdown of Wolf Creek.\nAn extended outage of Wolf Creek, whether resulting from NRC action, an incident at the plant or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Evergy Companies in the event replacement power and other costs are not recovered through rates or insurance.  If a long-term outage occurred, the state regulatory commissions could reduce rates by excluding the Wolf Creek investment from rate base.  Wolf Creek commenced operations in 1985 and the age of Wolf Creek increases the risk of unplanned outages and results in higher maintenance costs.\nOn an annual basis, Evergy Kansas South and Evergy Metro are required to contribute money to tax-qualified trusts that were established to pay for decommissioning costs at the end of the unit's life.  The amount of contributions varies depending on estimates of decommissioning expenses and projected return on trust assets.  If the actual return on trust assets is below the projected level or actual decommissioning costs are higher than estimated, Evergy Kansas South and Evergy Metro could be responsible for the balance of funds required and may not be allowed to recover the balance through rates.\nThe Evergy Companies are also exposed to other risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit, including, but not limited to, (i) potential liability associated with the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of a nuclear generating unit, (ii) the storage, handling, disposal and potential release (by accident, through third-party actions or otherwise) of radioactive materials and (iii) uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessments if insurance coverage is inadequate.  Under the structure for insurance among owners of nuclear generating units, Evergy Kansas South and Evergy Metro are also liable for potential retrospective premium assessments (subject to a cap) per incident at any commercial reactor in the country and losses in excess of insurance coverage.\nIn addition, Wolf Creek is reliant on a sole supplier for fuel and related services.  The supplier has in the past been the subject of Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings, and an extended outage of Wolf Creek could occur if the supplier is not able to perform under its contracts with Wolf Creek.  Switching to another supplier could take an extended amount of time and would require NRC approval.  An extended outage at Wolf Creek could affect the amount of Wolf Creek investment included in customer rates and could have a material impact on the Evergy Companies' financial results.\nThe structure of the regional power market in which the Evergy Companies operate could have an adverse effect on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are members of the SPP regional transmission organization, and each has transferred operational authority (but not ownership) of their transmission facilities to the SPP.  The SPP's Integrated Marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run,\n24\nwithin the operating constraints of a unit, at any given time.  The SPP's rules are primarily designed to provide for maximum cost-effectiveness, but in certain respects the rules also provide preferential treatment for certain resources based on public policy initiatives, such as increasing the deployment of renewable generation.  If Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's or Evergy Missouri West's generating resources are not dispatched, each could experience decreased levels of wholesale electricity sales.\nThe rules governing the various regional power markets, including the SPP, may change from time to time and such changes could impact the costs and revenues of the Evergy Companies.\nLitigation Risks:\nThe outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted.  An adverse finding could have a material adverse effect on the Evergy Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Evergy Companies are parties to various lawsuits and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their respective businesses.  The outcome of these matters cannot be determined, nor, in many cases, can the liability that could potentially result from each case be reasonably estimated.  The liability that the Evergy Companies may incur with respect to any of these cases may be in excess of amounts currently accrued and insured against with respect to such matters and could adversely impact the financial results for the Evergy Companies.\nCOVID-19 Risks:\nThe spread of COVID-19 and resulting impact on business and economic conditions could continue to negatively affect the Evergy Companies' business and operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on the way that the Evergy Companies conduct their operations and could adversely impact their results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity.  Further, the spread of COVID-19 has resulted in efforts to contain the virus, such as quarantines, restrictions on travel, closures and reduced operations of businesses, governmental agencies and other institutions.  The pandemic, along with the efforts to contain the virus, has caused and could continue to cause an economic slowdown or recession, result in significant disruptions or reductions in various public, commercial or industrial activities and cause employee absences, which could interfere with the Evergy Companies' operations or the operations of their customers.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has altered electricity usage patterns, including an overall reduction in demand and shifting usage away from customers with relatively higher load requirements, such as industrial and commercial customers, toward customers with relatively lower load requirements, such as residential customers.  These changes in electricity usage patterns and the extent to which some of these shifts could become long-term or permanent could result in a significant decrease in the Evergy Companies' sales of electricity.\nThe Evergy Companies have also incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses related to monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and modifying operations in response to the pandemic.  In July 2020, the KCC authorized Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro to record to a regulatory asset all net incremental costs incurred with respect to their Kansas operations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic for consideration in their next Kansas rate cases, which are expected to be completed no later than the end of 2023.  Additionally, the KCC order stated that the KCC will also consider granting the recovery of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's lost revenues associated with the COVID-19 pandemic as part of their next Kansas rate cases.  In January 2021, the MPSC authorized Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West to defer to a regulatory asset certain net incremental costs incurred between March 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021 associated with the COVID-19 pandemic for consideration in their next rate cases.  Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West can petition the MPSC to extend the period subject to the Accounting Authority Order (AAO).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, regulators might not allow for recovery of these amounts in a timely manner, or at all.  In addition, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West elected into plant-in service accounting (PISA) in Missouri effective as of January 1, 2019, which, by law, requires each company to keep base rates constant for three years following Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's last\n25\ngeneral rate case.  These and other factors may result in under-recovery of costs or failure to earn the authorized return on investment, or both.\nThe Evergy Companies have also temporarily implemented policies, and in the future may implement additional policies, that are intended to ease the financial burden of the pandemic on customers, such as temporarily extending payment options and offering incentives for customer payments on overdue balances as well as the elimination of late payment fees and disconnections for non-payment. There is also the possibility that legislation or regulations could be enacted at the federal or state level that would further restrict the Evergy Companies' ability to discontinue service to customers in the event of non-payment or to collect amounts owed from customers for service provided. These measures could result in an overall increase in customer non-payment or delay in the timely receipt of customer payments, which could result in a significant increase in the Evergy Companies' credit loss expense or significant decrease in operating cash flows.\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West sell retail electric accounts receivable to independent outside investors as a source of liquidity.  These arrangements include covenants that limit the extent to which accounts receivable can be delinquent or unpaid.  A decrease in the amount of, or a delay in receiving, customer collections due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise could, absent a waiver or amendment, result in a breach of these accounts receivable financing arrangements and require the Evergy Companies to repay any outstanding loans.  Further, in 2020, the Evergy Companies have experienced lower retail electric sales as a result of decreases in weather-normalized commercial and industrial demand.  To the extent that the Evergy Companies continue to experience lower electric sales, they may not have sufficient eligible receivables to maximize their borrowing capacity under their receivables sales facilities or could be required to repay additional portions of their borrowings under the facilities.  In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic led to disruption and volatility in the financial markets, which in turn could impair the Evergy Companies' ability to access the capital markets or increase their cost of capital.\nThe Evergy Companies are planning to make significant capital expenditures and they regularly conduct maintenance on their facilities.  The pandemic could disrupt the supply chains that provide services and equipment to the Evergy Companies as part of their capital expenditures or maintenance efforts.  If the Evergy Companies' supply chains are disrupted, the Evergy Companies may be unable to perform necessary maintenance, which could result in increased costs as the Evergy Companies implement contingency plans to allow them to continue to operate.  Supply chain interruptions may also increase the cost of maintenance and capital expenditures or result in the delay or cancellation of planned projects, any of which could have a material adverse impact on the Evergy Companies' results of operations.\nThe Evergy Companies also have a significant amount of NOLs, tax credits and other tax carryforwards that are recorded as deferred income tax assets on their balance sheets.  These tax benefits have various expiration dates and other limitations on the extent to which the benefits can be realized.  The Evergy Companies regularly assess their future ability to utilize tax benefits to determine whether a valuation allowance is necessary.  A significant reduction in the Evergy Companies' taxable income due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise could require the Evergy Companies to record a valuation allowance against a portion of those tax assets, which in turn reduces earnings, and the Evergy Companies may in general not be able to utilize these tax benefits.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way the Evergy Companies operate and has increased the use of technology to enable remote-working arrangements, which may increase or expose previously unknown vulnerabilities.  Public reports have also indicated an increase in cyberattacks in general since the start of the pandemic due, in part, to the increase in the number of employees working remotely and the proliferation of the different ways in which employees and third parties interact with the Evergy Companies' information technology infrastructure.  A successful attack against the Evergy Companies or cyberattacks to interconnected utilities, municipalities, others or widespread attacks to the utility industry could result in disruption to the Evergy Companies' generation, transmission and distribution systems or to the electrical grid in general, reduce sales and could increase the cost of insurance coverage or result in a decline in the U.S. economy.  Furthermore, insurance may not be adequate to cover any associated losses.\n26\nAny of these circumstances, or other impacts of the pandemic, could adversely affect customer demand or revenues, impact the ability of the Evergy Companies' suppliers, vendors or contractors to perform, or cause other unpredictable events, which could have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations, financial position, liquidity and cash flows of the Evergy Companies."

None of the registrants make any representation as to information related solely to Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central or Evergy Metro other than itself.\nThe following MD&A generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019.  Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 can be found in MD&A in Part II, Item 7, of the Evergy Companies' combined annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.\nEVERGY, INC.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nEvergy is a public utility holding company incorporated in 2017 and headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri.  Evergy operates primarily through the following wholly-owned direct subsidiaries listed below.\n•\nEvergy Kansas Central is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Kansas.  Evergy Kansas Central has one active wholly-owned subsidiary with significant operations, Evergy Kansas South.\n•\nEvergy Metro is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the states of Missouri and Kansas.\n•\nEvergy Missouri West is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Missouri.\n•\nEvergy Transmission Company owns 13.5% of Transource with the remaining 86.5% owned by AEP Transmission Holding Company, LLC, a subsidiary of AEP.  Transource is focused on the development of competitive electric transmission projects.  Evergy Transmission Company accounts for its investment in Transource under the equity method.\n33\nEvergy Kansas Central also owns a 50% interest in Prairie Wind, which is a joint venture between Evergy Kansas Central and subsidiaries of AEP and Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company.  Prairie Wind owns a 108-mile, 345 kV double-circuit transmission line that provides transmission service in the SPP.  Evergy Kansas Central accounts for its investment in Prairie Wind under the equity method.\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Kansas South, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West conduct business in their respective service territories using the name Evergy.  Collectively, the Evergy Companies have approximately 15,400 MWs of owned generating capacity and renewable power purchase agreements and engage in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 1.6 million customers in the states of Kansas and Missouri.  The Evergy Companies assess financial performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis (i.e., operate in one segment).\nStrategy\nEvergy expects to continue operating its integrated utilities within the currently existing regulatory frameworks.  In August 2020, Evergy announced a five-year Sustainability Transformation Plan, or STP, to optimize and enhance value creation for shareholders, customers, communities and employees.  Significant elements of the plan include:\n•\ntargeting a reduction of approximately $330 million of operating and maintenance expense by 2024 from 2018 adjusted operating and maintenance expense (non-GAAP) (see \"Non-GAAP Measures\" within this Executive Summary for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure);\n•\ntargeting a reduction of approximately $145 million of fuel and purchased power expense between 2019 and 2024; and\n•\ntargeting approximately $8.9 billion of expected base capital investments through 2024.  Of this amount, Evergy estimates approximately $2.9 billion to qualify for PISA in Missouri, and approximately $1.9 billion to be focused on FERC-jurisdictional improvements.  See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources; Capital Expenditures\", for further information regarding Evergy's projected capital expenditures through 2024.\nThe STP also enhances Evergy's efforts to mitigate future strategic risk through the responsible and accelerated reduction of CO\n2\nemissions.  In 2020, Evergy achieved a reduction of CO\n2\nemissions of approximately 50% from 2005 levels and announced a goal to achieve an 80% reduction from 2005 levels by 2050.  The STP has the potential to reduce CO\n2\nemissions by as much as 85% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.  The STP includes steps that would expedite CO\n2\nemission reductions by pursuing constructive legislative and regulatory recovery mechanisms to facilitate the retirement of coal-fired generation and expansion of Evergy's wind and solar footprint, while maintaining reliability.  The pace of CO\n2\nemission reductions will ultimately be defined by continued collaboration with stakeholders as part of Evergy's triennial integrated resource plan.  Furthermore, the trajectory and timing for reaching this goal could be impacted by political, legal and regulatory actions and applicable technology developments.\nSee \"Cautionary Statements Regarding Certain Forward-Looking Information\" and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information.\nAgreements with Elliott Investment Management L.P. and Bluescape Energy Partners, LLC\nOn February 25, 2021, Evergy entered into separate agreements with Bluescape Energy Partners, LLC, (Bluescape) Elliott Investment Management L.P. (Elliott) and affiliates of Elliott.  As part of the agreement with Bluescape (the Bluescape Agreement), C. John Wilder, Executive Chairman of Bluescape, and Mary L. Landrieu, former U.S. Senator for Louisiana, will join the Evergy Board effective as of March 1, 2021.\nIn addition, pursuant to a securities purchase agreement, by and between Evergy and an affiliate of Bluescape, dated as of February 25, 2021 (the Bluescape Investment Agreement), Bluescape has agreed to purchase 2,269,447 shares of Evergy’s common stock for approximately $113.2 million and will receive a warrant to purchase up to 3,950,000 additional shares of Evergy’s common stock, in each case subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions,\n34\nincluding the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.  The warrant will have a term of three years and an exercise price equal to $64.70.\nEach of Bluescape and Elliott also agreed to customary standstill, voting and other provisions in connection with the foregoing.  The foregoing summaries of the Bluescape Agreement and the Bluescape Investment Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Bluescape Agreement and the Bluescape Investment Agreement, respectively, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, to Evergy’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on February 26, 2021 and are incorporated herein by reference.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on the way that the Evergy Companies conduct their operations, including the implementation of social distancing and other preventative protocols and the direction of employees to work remotely when possible.  Further, the spread of COVID-19 has resulted in efforts to contain the virus, such as quarantines, restrictions on travel, closures and the reduced operations of businesses, governmental agencies and other institutions.  The pandemic, along with the efforts to contain the virus, has caused and could continue to cause an economic slowdown or recession, result in significant disruptions or reductions in various public, commercial or industrial activities and cause employee absences.  In the states of Missouri and Kansas as well as certain counties and municipalities within the Evergy Companies' service territory, \"stay-at-home\" orders were in effect for parts of 2020 and could be implemented again in the future.\nGovernmental mandates that restrict the operation of businesses, governmental agencies and other institutions continue to remain in effect and a substantial portion of the Evergy Companies' service territory is also required to utilize preventative measures such as the wearing of face coverings while in public areas.  The announcement in late 2020 of multiple COVID-19 vaccines with high expected effectiveness rates could serve to mitigate both the severity and ongoing duration of the COVID-19 outbreak.  However, both the magnitude and timing of the impact of the COVID-19 vaccines is not yet known and could be subject to multiple factors including the available supply of vaccine, the vaccine adoption rate by the general public and the achievement of the vaccines' expected effectiveness rates.  Management cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained, nor can it predict the severity and ongoing duration of its impact.\nDuring 2020, Evergy experienced an overall reduction in demand and shift of usage away from customers with relatively higher load requirements, such as industrial and commercial customers, towards customers with relatively lower load requirements, such as residential customers.  In 2020, approximately 39% of Evergy's total revenues came from residential customers and approximately 45% came from commercial and industrial customers, compared with approximately 37% from residential customers and 47% from commercial and industrial customers in 2019.  The KCC and MPSC have established different prices for the Evergy Companies' residential, commercial and industrial customers and a similar change in demand across each customer class will have a different impact on earnings.  As a result, the impacts to Evergy's earnings from a reduction in demand from industrial and commercial customers have been partially offset by an increase in demand from residential customers.\nThe Evergy Companies have also temporarily implemented policies, and in the future may implement additional policies, that are intended to ease the financial burden of the pandemic on customers.  These policies, such as temporarily extending payment options and offering incentives for customer payments on overdue balances as well as the elimination of late payment fees and disconnections for non-payment, could lead to lower levels of operating cash flows compared to historical levels for the Evergy Companies.  In addition, these policies, along with lower electric sales as a result of the overall reduction in demand discussed above, could also lead to the additional repayment of portions of the Evergy Companies' borrowings under receivable sale facilities.\nFinally, the Evergy Companies have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses related to monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and modifying operations in response to the pandemic that are recorded in operating and maintenance expense.\nIn May 2020, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West filed joint requests for AAOs with the KCC and MPSC, as applicable, that would allow for the extraordinary costs and lost revenues incurred by the\n35\ncompanies, net of any COVID-19-related savings, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to be considered for future recovery from customers as part of their next rate cases.  The KCC approved the AAO request in July 2020.\nIn October 2020, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West entered into a non-unanimous stipulation and agreement with the MPSC staff and other intervenors that would allow Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West to defer to a regulatory asset certain net incremental costs incurred associated with the COVID-19 pandemic for consideration in their next rate cases.  The MPSC approved the AAO request in January 2021.\nEvergy's management is actively monitoring the evolving impact of COVID-19 on its results of operations and developments affecting its workforce and suppliers and will take additional actions as it believes are warranted.  The situation is continuously evolving and future impacts may materialize that are not yet known.  Accordingly, the extent to which COVID-19 and the factors noted above may impact the results of operations, financial position, cash flows and liquidity of the Evergy Companies will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information concerning the severity and ongoing duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and the actions taken to contain it or to seek recovery of its impact, among others.\nSee \"Cautionary Statements Regarding Certain Forward-Looking Information\" and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information.\nFebruary 2021 Winter Weather Event\nIn February 2021, much of the central and southern United States, including the service territories of the Evergy Companies, experienced a significant winter weather event that resulted in extremely cold temperatures over a multi-day period.\nThis winter weather event resulted in an increase in the demand for natural gas used by the Evergy Companies for generating electricity and also contributed to the limited availability of other generation resources, including coal and renewables, within the SPP Integrated Marketplace.\nThe Evergy Companies are members of the SPP and, as a result, principally sell and purchase power through the SPP’s Integrated Marketplace for the Evergy Companies’ retail electric customers.\nThese circumstances resulted in higher than normal market prices for both natural gas and power for the duration of the winter weather event.\nEvergy estimates that as part of the winter weather event, it experienced an increase in natural gas and purchased power costs, net of wholesale revenues, of approximately $300 million.  This $300 million increase in net fuel and purchased power costs was primarily driven by a $260 million increase in costs at Evergy Missouri West and a $100 million increase at Evergy Kansas Central, partially offset by a $60 million net increase in wholesale revenues at Evergy Metro.  These amounts represent preliminary estimates and are still under development.  Further, the final amount of purchased power costs incurred by the Evergy Companies is subject to final settlement pricing by the SPP Integrated Marketplace, which is currently expected to take an additional 30 to 45 days, though the ultimate timing is uncertain.\nThe Evergy Companies have fuel recovery mechanisms in their Kansas and Missouri jurisdictions, as applicable, that allow them to defer substantially all of any increased fuel and purchased power costs, net of wholesale revenues, to a regulatory asset for future recovery from customers.\nFurther, in February 2021, the KCC issued an emergency order that would allow the Evergy Companies, as applicable, to defer to a regulatory asset any extraordinary costs incurred to continue providing electric service during the winter weather event for consideration in future rate proceedings.\nWhile the Evergy Companies expect to recover substantially all of any increased fuel and purchased power costs related to the winter weather event from customers, it is possible that the timing of the cost recovery could be delayed or spread over a longer than typical recovery timeframe by the KCC or the MPSC given the extraordinary nature of the winter weather event.\nThe Evergy Companies also engage in limited non-regulated energy marketing activities in various regional power markets that have historically not had a significant impact on the Evergy Companies’ results of operations.\nAs a result of the elevated market prices experienced in regional power markets in February 2021 across the central and southern United States driven by the winter weather event discussed above, the Evergy Companies currently expect that their energy marketing margins will be higher in 2021 compared with historical results.\n36\nThe full financial statement impact of the winter weather event is unknown and cannot be estimated at this time due in part to the timing of market settlement data.\nThe Evergy Companies believe they have sufficient liquidity to pay any outstanding balances or fulfill collateral posting requirements related to purchases made during the winter storm event and to operate their retail electric businesses through their cash on hand and master credit facility with available borrowing capacity as of February 25, 2021 of approximately $2 billion.\nRegulatory Proceedings\nSee Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding regulatory proceedings.\nEarnings Overview\nThe following table summarizes Evergy's net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS).\nNet income attributable to Evergy, Inc. decreased in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to lower retail sales driven by unfavorable weather and a decrease in weather-normalized commercial and industrial demand primarily due to temporary business closures and hours of operation and capacity limitations as a result of COVID-19 that were partially offset by an increase in weather-normalized residential demand and higher depreciation expense and higher interest expense; partially offset by lower operating and maintenance expenses in 2020.\nDiluted EPS decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the decrease in net income attributable to Evergy discussed above, partially offset by a lower number of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding in 2020, which increased EPS by $0.14 for 2020.\nFor additional information regarding the change in net income, refer to the Evergy Results of Operations section within this MD&A.\nAdjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) and Adjusted EPS (non-GAAP)\nEvergy's adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) for 2020 were $705.5 million or $3.10 per share, respectively.  For 2019, Evergy's adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) were $694.0 million or $2.89 per share, respectively.  In addition to net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. and diluted EPS, Evergy's management uses adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) to evaluate earnings and EPS without the costs resulting from rebranding, voluntary severance, advisor expenses and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in the Kansas corporate income tax rate.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted EPS\nAdjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are intended to enhance an investor's overall understanding of results.  Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Evergy Board.  Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP) are financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report.\n37\nThe following table provides a reconciliation between net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. and diluted EPS as determined in accordance with GAAP and adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) and adjusted EPS (non-GAAP).\n(a)\nReflects external costs incurred to rebrand the legacy Westar Energy and KCP&L utility brands to Evergy and are included in operating and maintenance expense on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n(b)\nReflects severance costs incurred associated with certain voluntary severance programs at the Evergy Companies and are included in operating and maintenance expense on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n(c)\nReflects advisor expenses incurred associated with strategic planning and are included in operating and maintenance expense on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n(d)\nReflects an income tax effect calculated at a statutory rate of approximately 26%, with the exception of certain non-deductible items.\n(e)\nReflects the revaluation of Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's deferred income tax assets and liabilities from the Kansas corporate income tax rate change and are included in income tax expense on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n38\n2018 Adjusted Operating and Maintenance Expense\nThe following table provides a reconciliation between 2018 operating and maintenance expense and 2018 pro forma operating and maintenance expense as determined in accordance with GAAP and 2018 adjusted operating and maintenance expense (non-GAAP).  Evergy's 2018 adjusted operating and maintenance expense (non-GAAP) is used as the base for targeted operating and maintenance expense reductions by 2024 as part of Evergy's STP.\n(a)\nReflects pro forma adjustments made in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X and ASC 805 -\nBusiness Combinations\n.  See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the Evergy Companies' combined 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding these adjustments.\n(b)\nReflects severance costs incurred associated with certain voluntary severance programs at the Evergy Companies and are included in operating and maintenance expense on the 2018 consolidated statements of comprehensive income in the Evergy Companies' combined 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(c)\nReflects the portion of the $47.8 million deferral of merger transition costs to a regulatory asset in June 2018 that related to costs incurred prior to 2018.  The remaining merger transition costs included within the $47.8 million deferral were both incurred and deferred in 2018 and did not impact earnings.  This item is included in operating and maintenance expense on the 2018 consolidated statements of comprehensive income in the Evergy Companies' combined 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(d)\nReflects obsolete inventory write-offs for Evergy Kansas Central's Unit 7 at Tecumseh Energy Center, Units 3 and 4 at Murray Gill Energy Center, Units 1 and 2 at Gordon Evans Energy Center, Evergy Metro's Montrose Station and Evergy Missouri West's Sibley Station and are included in operating and maintenance expense on the 2018 consolidated statements of comprehensive income in the Evergy Companies' combined 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nSee Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nSee Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding related party transactions.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures.  Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate, or different estimates that could have been used, could have a material impact on Evergy's results of operations and financial position.  Management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to the understanding of Evergy's results of operations and financial position.  Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Evergy Board.\nPensions\nEvergy incurs significant costs in providing non-contributory defined pension benefits.  The costs are measured using actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors derived from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience.\n39\nPension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, life expectancies, compensation levels and employment periods), earnings on plan assets, the level of contributions made to the plan, and plan amendments.  In addition, pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs.\nThe assumed rate of return on plan assets was developed based on the weighted-average of long-term returns forecast for the expected portfolio mix of investments held by the plan.  The assumed discount rate was selected based on the prevailing market rate of fixed income debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the benefit obligation.  These assumptions, updated annually at the measurement date, are based on management's best estimates and judgment; however, material changes may occur if these assumptions differ from actual events.  See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs.\nThe following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a 0.5% increase or a 0.5% decrease in key actuarial assumptions for Evergy's qualified pension plans.  Each sensitivity reflects the impact of the change based on a change in that assumption only.\nPension expense for Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West is recorded in accordance with rate orders from the KCC and MPSC.  The orders allow the difference between pension costs under GAAP and pension costs for ratemaking to be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability with future ratemaking recovery or refunds, as appropriate.\nIn 2020, Evergy's pension expense was $129.5 million under GAAP and $159.1 million for ratemaking.  The impact on 2021 pension expense in the table above reflects the impact on GAAP pension costs.  Under the Evergy Companies' rate agreements, any increase or decrease in GAAP pension expense is deferred to a regulatory asset or liability for future ratemaking treatment.  See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the accounting for pensions.\nMarket conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of the plan.  It is difficult to predict future pension costs, changes in pension liability and cash funding requirements due to the inherent uncertainty of market conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nEvergy recognizes revenue on the sale of electricity to customers over time as the service is provided in the amount it has the right to invoice.  Revenues recorded include electric services provided but not yet billed by Evergy.  Unbilled revenues are recorded for kWh usage in the period following the customers' billing cycle to the end of the month.  This estimate is based on net system kWh usage less actual billed kWhs.  Evergy's estimated unbilled kWhs are allocated and priced by regulatory jurisdiction across the rate classes based on actual billing rates.  Evergy's unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand, weather, line losses and\n40\nchanges in the composition of customer classes.  See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for the balance of unbilled receivables for Evergy as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nEvergy has recorded assets and liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process, which would not otherwise be recorded under GAAP.  Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues.  Regulatory liabilities represent future reductions in revenues or refunds to customers.\nManagement regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the MPSC, KCC or FERC in Evergy's rate case filings; decisions in other regulatory proceedings, including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to Evergy; and changes in laws and regulations.  If recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations.  Evergy's continued ability to meet the criteria for recording regulatory assets and liabilities may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry or changes in accounting rules.  In the event that the criteria no longer applied to all or a portion of Evergy's operations, the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism were provided.  Additionally, these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets.  See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nImpairments of Assets and Goodwill\nLong-lived assets are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under GAAP.\nAccounting rules require goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists.  The goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to identify potential impairment.  In the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value.  Evergy's consolidated operations are considered one reporting unit for assessment of impairment, as management assesses financial performance and allocates resources on a consolidated basis.  The annual impairment test for the $2,336.6 million of goodwill from the Great Plains Energy and Evergy Kansas Central merger was conducted as of May 1, 2020.  The fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying amount, including goodwill.  As a result, there was no impairment of goodwill.\nThe determination of fair value for the reporting unit consisted of two valuation techniques: an income approach consisting of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach consisting of a determination of reporting unit invested capital using a market multiple derived from the historical earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and market prices of the stock of peer companies.  The results of the two techniques were evaluated and weighted to determine a point within the range that management considered representative of fair value for the reporting unit, which involves a significant amount of management judgment.\nThe discounted cash flow analysis is most significantly impacted by two assumptions: estimated future cash flows and the discount rate applied to those cash flows.  Management determines the appropriate discount rate to be based on the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital (WACC).  The WACC takes into account both the return on equity authorized by the KCC and MPSC and after-tax cost of debt.  Estimated future cash flows are based on Evergy's internal business plan, which assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future, such as the outcome of future rate filings, future approved rates of return on equity, anticipated returns of and earnings on future capital investments, continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts.  Management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operations, maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events.  Should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions differ significantly from the current assumptions, revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair\n41\nvalue of the Evergy reporting unit under the income approach to be significantly different in future periods and could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill.\nThe market approach analysis is most significantly impacted by management's selection of relevant peer companies as well as the determination of an appropriate control premium to be added to the calculated invested capital of the reporting unit, as control premiums associated with a controlling interest are not reflected in the quoted market price of a single share of stock.  Management determines an appropriate control premium by using an average of control premiums for recent acquisitions in the industry.  Changes in results of peer companies, selection of different peer companies and future acquisitions with significantly different control premiums could result in a significantly different fair value of the Evergy reporting unit.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset/liability approach.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the life of the related property.  Deferred tax assets are also recorded for net operating losses, capital losses and tax credit carryforwards.  Evergy is required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events reflected in Evergy's consolidated financial statements or tax returns.  Actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons including changes in income tax laws, enacted tax rates and results of audits by taxing authorities.  This process also requires management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact from which actual results may differ.  Evergy records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized.  See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nEvergy has recognized legal obligations associated with the disposal of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of such assets.  Concurrent with the recognition of the liability, the estimated cost of the ARO incurred at the time the related long-lived assets were either acquired, placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation became effective is also recorded to property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets.  The recording of AROs for regulated operations has no income statement impact due to the deferral of the adjustments through the establishment of a regulatory asset or an offset to a regulatory liability.\nEvergy initially recorded AROs at fair value for the estimated cost to decommission Wolf Creek (94% indirect share), retire wind generating facilities, dispose of asbestos insulating material at its power plants, remediate ash disposal ponds and close ash landfills, among other items.  ARO refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity.  In determining Evergy's AROs, assumptions are made regarding probable future disposal costs and the timing of their occurrence.  A change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on Evergy's AROs reflected on its consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Evergy had recorded AROs of $941.9 million and $674.1 million, respectively.  See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding Evergy's AROs.\nEVERGY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nEvergy's results of operations and financial position are affected by a variety of factors including rate regulation, fuel costs, weather, customer behavior and demand, the economy and competitive forces.\nSubstantially all of Evergy's revenues are subject to state or federal regulation.  This regulation has a significant impact on the price the Evergy Companies charge for electric service.  Evergy's results of operations and financial position are affected by its ability to align overall spending, both operating and capital, within the frameworks established by its regulators.\n42\nWholesale revenues are impacted by, among other factors, demand, cost and availability of fuel and purchased power, price volatility, available generation capacity, transmission availability and weather.\nThe Evergy Companies primarily use coal and uranium for the generation of electricity for their customers and also purchase power through renewable power purchase agreements or on the open market.  The prices for fuel used in generation or the market price of power purchases can fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors including supply, demand, weather and the broader economic environment.  Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have fuel recovery mechanisms in their Kansas and Missouri jurisdictions, as applicable, that allow them to defer and subsequently recover or refund, through customer rates, substantially all of the variance in net energy costs from the amount set in base rates without a general rate case proceeding.\nWeather significantly affects the amount of electricity that Evergy's customers use as electricity sales are seasonal.  As summer peaking utilities, the third quarter typically accounts for the greatest electricity sales by the Evergy Companies.  Hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand, especially among residential and commercial customers, and to a lesser extent, industrial customers.  Mild weather reduces customer demand.\nEnergy efficiency investments by customers and the Evergy Companies also can affect the demand for electric service.  Through the Missouri Energy Efficiency Investment Act (MEEIA), Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West offer energy efficiency and demand side management programs to their Missouri retail customers and recover program costs, throughput disincentive, and as applicable, certain earnings opportunities in retail rates through a rider mechanism.\nThe Evergy Companies' taxes other than income taxes, of which property taxes are a significant component, can fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including changes in taxable values and property tax rates.  Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro's Kansas jurisdiction have property tax surcharges that allow them to defer and subsequently recover or refund, through customer rates, substantially all of the variance in property tax costs from the amounts set in base rates without a general rate case proceeding.\nSee \"Executive Summary - Impact of COVID-19\" for information regarding the effects of COVID-19 on Evergy's results of operation and financial position.\nThe following table summarizes Evergy's comparative results of operations.\n43\nEvergy Utility Gross Margin and MWh Sales\nUtility gross margin is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Utility gross margin, as used by the Evergy Companies, is defined as operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs and amounts billed by the SPP for network transmission costs.  Expenses for fuel and purchased power costs, offset by wholesale sales margin, are subject to recovery through cost adjustment mechanisms.  As a result, changes in fuel and purchased power costs are offset in operating revenues with minimal impact on net income.  In addition, SPP network transmission costs fluctuate primarily due to investments by SPP members for upgrades to the transmission grid within the SPP RTO.  As with fuel and purchased power costs, changes in SPP network transmission costs are mostly reflected in the prices charged to customers with minimal impact on net income.  See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the manner in which Evergy reflects SPP revenues and expenses.\nManagement believes that utility gross margin provides a meaningful basis for evaluating the Evergy Companies' operations across periods because utility gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses.  Utility gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Evergy Board.  Utility gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, income from operations, which is the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The Evergy Companies' definition of utility gross margin may differ from similar terms used by other companies.\nThe following table summarizes Evergy's utility gross margin and MWhs sold.\n(a)\nUtility\ngross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure.  See explanation of utility gross margin above.\nEvergy's utility gross margin decreased $80.3 million in 2020, compared to 2019, driven by:\n•\na $71.4 million decrease primarily due to lower retail sales driven by unfavorable weather (cooling degree days decreased 5% and heating degree days decreased 11%) and a decrease in weather-normalized commercial and industrial demand primarily due to temporary business closures and hours of operation and capacity limitations resulting from government restrictions to slow the spread of COVID-19 in 2020, partially offset by an increase in weather-normalized residential demand;\n•\na $14.4 million decrease in revenue recognized for the MEEIA earnings opportunity in 2020 related to the achievement of certain customer energy savings levels in the second cycle of Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's MEEIA programs; and\n44\n•\na $5.9 million decrease related to Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's transmission delivery charge (TDC) riders in 2020; partially offset by\n•\na $7.6 million increase in Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's MEEIA throughput disincentive in 2020 primarily driven by the cumulative amount of customer energy savings achieved in the second and third cycles of Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's MEEIA programs; and\n•\na $3.8 million increase for recovery of programs costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA in 2020, which have a direct offset in operating and maintenance expense.\nOperating and Maintenance\nEvergy's operating and maintenance expense decreased $55.5 million in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily driven by:\n•\na $44.2 million decrease in transmission and distribution operating and maintenance expense primarily due to $13.1 million of costs at Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West incurred from storms that occurred in January 2019, a $6.9 million decrease due to lower vegetation management expense at Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro in 2020 and lower labor expense in 2020;\n•\na $37.4 million decrease in various administrative and general operating and maintenance expenses primarily driven by:\n◦\na $15.5 million decrease in labor and employee benefits expense that included lower employee headcount in 2020;\n◦\nan $8.9 million decrease in outside services expenses including lower consulting and legal fees at Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro in 2020; and\n◦\na $3.7 million decrease in property insurance expense due to a higher annual refund of nuclear insurance premiums received by Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro in 2020 related to their ownership interest in Wolf Creek;\n•\na $27.2 million decrease in plant operating and maintenance expense at fossil-fuel generating units primarily due to:\n◦\na $14.5 million decrease at Evergy Metro driven by a $12.4 million decrease primarily due to outages at Hawthorn Station, Iatan Station and La Cygne Unit 2 as well as lower employee headcount in 2020; and\n◦\na $8.3 million decrease at Evergy Kansas Central primarily due to an $8.4 million write-off of a regulatory asset for costs incurred during the Jeffrey Energy Center (JEC) lease extension in 2019, a $6.0 million decrease related to maintenance outages at JEC, La Cygne Unit 2 and Lawrence Energy Center as well as lower employee headcount in 2020; partially offset by a $3.9 million asset write-off in 2020; and\n•\n$12.1 million of external costs incurred to rebrand the legacy Westar Energy and KCP&L utility brands to Evergy in 2019; partially offset by\n•\na $46.7 million increase in voluntary severance expenses due to a $39.3 million increase at Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West related to Evergy voluntary exit programs in 2020 and $7.4 million of voluntary severance expenses incurred in 2020 by Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro related to Wolf Creek voluntary exit programs;\n•\n$32.3 million of advisor expenses incurred in 2020 by Evergy associated with strategic planning; and\n•\na $3.8 million increase in program costs for energy efficiency programs under MEEIA in 2020, which have a direct offset in revenue.\n45\nDepreciation and Amortization\nEvergy's depreciation and amortization increased $18.4 million in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily driven by capital additions at Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro.\nOther Expense, Net\nEvergy's other expense, net decreased $2.9 million in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily driven by:\n•\na $15.0 million decrease due to higher Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro equity allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) in 2020 primarily driven by lower short-term debt and higher construction work in progress balances in 2020; partially offset by\n•\na $10.3 million increase due to recording lower Evergy Kansas Central corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) benefits in 2020; and\n•\na $2.9 million increase primarily due to higher Evergy Metro pension non-service costs in 2020.\nInterest Expense\nEvergy's interest expense increased $9.9 million in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily driven by:\n•\na $35.3 million increase due to the issuance of Evergy's $1.6 billion of senior notes in September 2019;\n•\na $6.6 million net increase due to the issuance of Evergy Kansas Central's $500.0 million of 3.45% first mortgage bonds (FMBs) in April 2020, which increased interest expense by $12.6 million, partially offset by a $6.0 million decrease due to the repayment of Evergy Kansas Central's $250.0 million of 5.10% FMBs in May 2020; and\n•\na $5.4 million increase due to the issuance of Evergy Metro's $400.0 million of 2.25% Mortgage Bonds in May 2020; partially offset by\n•\na $29.5 million decrease primarily due to Evergy's borrowings under its $1.0 billion term loan credit agreement in 2019 and lower commercial paper balances and weighted-average interest rates on short-term borrowings at Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro in 2020;\n•\na $4.6 million net decrease due to the repayment of Evergy Metro's $400.0 million of 7.15% Mortgage Bonds at maturity in April 2019, which decreased interest expense by $8.5 million, partially offset by a $3.9 million increase due to Evergy Metro's issuance of $400.0 million of 4.125% Mortgage Bonds in March 2019; and\n•\na $3.1 million net decrease due to the repayment of Evergy Kansas South's $300.0 million of 6.70% FMBs at maturity in June 2019, which decreased interest expense by $9.2 million, partially offset by a $6.1 million increase due to the issuance of Evergy Kansas Central's $300.0 million of 3.25% FMBs in August 2019.\nIncome Tax Expense\nEvergy's income tax expense increased $5.2 million in 2020, compared to 2019, driven by a $13.8 million net increase due to the revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the second quarter of 2020 due to the change in the Kansas corporate income tax rate, a $5.8 million valuation allowance reversal in 2019 primarily related to alternative minimum tax (AMT) credits and the expiration of certain state NOL carryforwards and a $3.9 million increase due to lower wind and other income tax credits in 2020; partially offset by a $13.3 million decrease due to lower Evergy pre-tax income in 2020 and a $5.1 million decrease due to flow-through items primarily driven by higher amortization of excess deferred income taxes.\nSee Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the change in the Kansas corporate income tax rate.\nEVERGY SIGNIFICANT BALANCE SHEET CHANGES\n(December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019)\n•\nEvergy's cash and cash equivalents increased $121.7 million primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of Evergy Metro's $400.0 million of 2.25% Mortgage Bonds in May 2020 and the issuance of Evergy\n46\nKansas Central's $500.0 million of 3.45% FMBs in April 2020 after the redemption of Evergy Kansas Central's $250.0 million of 5.10% FMBs in May 2020 and the repayment of certain short-term borrowings.\n•\nEvergy's income tax receivable decreased by $22.6 million primarily due to Evergy's receipt of a federal AMT tax credit refund in the third quarter of 2020.\n•\nEvergy's current maturities of long-term debt increased $185.3 million primarily due to the reclassification of Evergy's $350.0 million of 4.85% Senior Notes and Evergy Missouri West's $80.9 million of 8.27% Senior Notes from long-term to current, partially offset by the repayment of Evergy Kansas Central's $250.0 million of 5.10% FMBs in May 2020.\n•\nEvergy's notes payable and commercial paper decreased $246.9 million primarily due to a $199.2 million decrease at Evergy Kansas Central and a $199.3 million decrease at Evergy Metro due to the repayment of short-term borrowings with funds from operations and with the issuance of Evergy Kansas Central's $500.0 million of 3.45% FMBs in April 2020 and Evergy Metro's $400.0 million of 2.25% Mortgage Bonds in May 2020, partially offset by a $180.0 million increase at Evergy, Inc. due to cash borrowings under its master credit facility.\n•\nEvergy's accounts payable increased $125.2 million primarily due to the timing of cash payments, including for property tax payments, at Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro.\n•\nEvergy's regulatory liabilities - current decreased $37.2 million primarily due to a $30.2 million decrease in Evergy Kansas Central's regulatory liability for its fuel recovery mechanism due to refunds exceeding over-collections.\n•\nEvergy's asset retirement obligations - current decreased $31.1 million primarily due to settlements incurred in 2020 and the expected timing of remediation at several Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro ash ponds.\n•\nEvergy's unamortized investment tax credits decreased $188.7 million primarily due to the revaluation of certain Kansas income tax credits due to the exemption of Evergy Kansas Central from Kansas corporate income tax beginning in 2021.  See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n•\nEvergy's asset retirement obligation - long-term increased $298.9 million primarily due to a $259.1 million increase due to the change in estimate of Evergy's ARO relating to the decommissioning of Wolf Creek.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nEvergy relies primarily upon cash from operations, short-term borrowings, debt and equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its capital requirements.  Evergy's capital requirements primarily consist of capital expenditures, payment of contractual obligations and other commitments and the payment of dividends to shareholders.\nCapital Sources\nCash Flows from Operations\nEvergy's cash flows from operations are driven by the regulated sale of electricity.  These cash flows are relatively stable but the timing and level of these cash flows can vary based on weather and economic conditions, future regulatory proceedings, the timing of cash payments made for costs recoverable under regulatory mechanisms and the time such costs are recovered, and unanticipated expenses such as unplanned plant outages and storms.\nShort-Term Borrowings\nAs of December 31, 2020, Evergy had $2.2 billion of available borrowing capacity from its master credit facility.  The available borrowing capacity under the master credit facility consisted of $249.3 million for Evergy, Inc., $933.0 million for Evergy Kansas Central, $600.0 million for Evergy Metro and $383.0 million for Evergy Missouri West.  Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's borrowing capacity under the master\n47\ncredit facility also supports their issuance of commercial paper.  See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the master credit facility.  Along with cash flows from operations and receivable sales facilities, Evergy generally uses borrowings under its master credit facility and the issuance of commercial paper to meet its day-to-day cash flow requirements.\nLong-Term Debt and Equity Issuances\nFrom time to time, Evergy issues long-term debt and equity to repay short-term debt, refinance maturing long-term debt and finance growth.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Evergy’s capital structure, excluding short-term debt, was as follows:\nUnder stipulations with the MPSC and KCC, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro are required to maintain common equity at not less than 35%, 40% and 40%, respectively, of total capitalization.  The master credit facility and certain debt instruments of the Evergy Companies also contain restrictions that require the maintenance of certain capitalization and leverage ratios.  As of December 31, 2020, the Evergy Companies were in compliance with these covenants.\nSignificant Debt Issuances\nSee Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding significant debt issuances.\nEquity Issuance\nSee Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding Evergy's securities purchase agreement with Bluescape to purchase Evergy's common stock in 2021.\nCredit Ratings\nThe ratings of the Evergy Companies' debt securities by the credit rating agencies impact the Evergy Companies' liquidity, including the cost of borrowings under their master credit facility and in the capital markets.  The Evergy Companies view maintenance of strong credit ratings as vital to their access to and cost of debt financing and, to that end, maintain an active and ongoing dialogue with the agencies with respect to results of operations, financial position and future prospects.  While a decrease in these credit ratings would not cause any acceleration of the Evergy Companies' debt, it could increase interest charges under the master credit facility.  A decrease in credit ratings could also have, among other things, an adverse impact, which could be material, on the Evergy Companies' access to capital, the cost of funds, the ability to recover actual interest costs in state regulatory proceedings, the type and amounts of collateral required under supply agreements and Evergy's ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries.\n48\nAs of February 25, 2021, the major credit rating agencies rated the Evergy Companies' securities as detailed in the following table.\n(a)\nA securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency.\nShelf Registration Statements and Regulatory Authorizations\nEvergy\nIn November 2018, Evergy filed an automatic shelf registration statement providing for the sale of unlimited amounts of securities with the SEC, which expires in November 2021.\nEvergy Kansas Central\nIn November 2018, Evergy Kansas Central filed an automatic shelf registration statement providing for the sale of unlimited amounts of unsecured debt securities and FMBs with the SEC, which expires in November 2021.\nEvergy Metro\nIn November 2018, Evergy Metro filed an automatic shelf registration statement providing for the sale of unlimited amounts of unsecured notes and mortgage bonds with the SEC, which expires in November 2021.\n49\nThe following table summarizes the regulatory short-term and long-term debt financing authorizations for Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Kansas South, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West and the remaining amount available under these authorizations as of December 31, 2020.\n(a)\nEvergy Missouri West's application for long-term debt authority with FERC was approved in February 2021.\nIn addition to the above regulatory authorizations, the Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Kansas South and Evergy Metro mortgages each contain provisions restricting the amount of FMBs or mortgage bonds, as applicable, that can be issued by each entity.  Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Kansas South and Evergy Metro must comply with these restrictions prior to the issuance of additional FMBs, mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness.\nUnder the Evergy Kansas Central mortgage, the issuance of FMBs is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions.  In addition, so long as any bonds issued prior to January 1, 1997, remain outstanding, the mortgage prohibits additional FMBs from being issued, except in connection with certain refundings, unless Evergy Kansas Central’s unconsolidated net earnings available for interest, depreciation and property retirement (which, as defined, does not include earnings or losses attributable to the ownership of securities of subsidiaries), for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding the issuance, are not less than the greater of twice the annual interest charges on or 10% of the principal amount of all FMBs outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance.  As of December 31, 2020, $780.6 million principal amount of additional FMBs could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage, except in connection with certain refundings.\nUnder the Evergy Kansas South mortgage, the amount of FMBs authorized is limited to a maximum of $3.5 billion and the issuance of FMBs is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions.  In addition, the mortgage prohibits additional FMBs from being issued, except in connection with certain refundings, unless Evergy Kansas South's net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and depreciation of property for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding the issuance are not less than either two and one-half times the annual interest charges on or 10% of the principal amount of all Evergy Kansas South FMBs outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance.  As of December 31, 2020, approximately $2,828.6 million principal amount of additional Evergy Kansas South FMBs could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage, except in connection with certain refundings.\nUnder the General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust dated as of December 1, 1986, as supplemented (Evergy Metro Mortgage Indenture), additional Evergy Metro mortgage bonds may be issued on the basis of 75% of property additions or retired bonds.  As of December 31, 2020, approximately $4,733.1 million principal amount of additional Evergy Metro mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAt December 31, 2020, Evergy had approximately $144.9 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand.\n50\nCapital Requirements\nCapital Expenditures\nEvergy requires significant capital investments and expects to need cash for the STP as well as other utility construction programs designed to improve and expand facilities related to providing electric service, which include, but are not limited to, expenditures to develop new transmission lines and improvements to power plants, transmission and distribution lines and equipment.  See \"Executive Summary - Strategy\", above for further information regarding the STP.  Evergy's capital expenditures were $1,560.3 million, $1,210.1 million and $1,069.7 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCapital expenditures projected for the next five years, excluding AFUDC and including costs of removal, are detailed in the following table.  This capital expenditure plan is subject to continual review and change.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nIn the course of its business activities, the Evergy Companies enter into a variety of contracts and commercial commitments.  Some of these result in direct obligations reflected on Evergy's consolidated balance sheets while others are commitments, some firm and some based on uncertainties, not reflected in Evergy's underlying consolidated financial statements.\nThe information in the following table is provided to summarize Evergy's cash obligations and commercial commitments.\n(a)\nEvergy expects to make contributions to the pension and other post-retirement plans beyond 2025 but the amounts are not yet determined.\nLong-term debt includes current maturities.  Long-term debt principal excludes $84.9 million of unamortized net discounts and debt issuance costs and a $110.4 million fair value adjustment recorded in connection with purchase\n51\naccounting for the Great Plains Energy and Evergy Kansas Central merger that was completed in June 2018.  Variable rate interest obligations are based on rates as of December 31, 2020.\nOperating lease commitments include leases for office buildings, computer equipment, operating facilities, vehicles and rail cars to serve jointly-owned generating units where Evergy Kansas Central or Evergy Metro is the managing partner and is reimbursed by other joint-owners for its proportionate share of the cost.  Finance lease commitments include obligations for both principal and interest.\nEvergy expects to contribute $135.7 million to the pension and other post-retirement plans in 2021, of which the majority is expected to be paid by Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro.  Additional contributions to the plans are expected beyond 2025 in amounts at least sufficient to meet the greater of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) or regulatory funding requirements; however, these amounts have not yet been determined.  Amounts for years after 2021 are estimates based on information available in determining the amount for 2021.  Actual amounts for years after 2021 could be significantly different than the estimated amounts in the table above.\nFuel commitments consist of commitments for nuclear fuel, coal and coal transportation costs.  Power commitments consist of certain commitments for renewable energy under power purchase agreements, capacity purchases and firm transmission service.  Other represents individual commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business.\nEvergy has other insignificant long-term liabilities recorded on its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020, which do not have a definitive cash payout date and are not included in the table above.\nCommon Stock Dividends\nThe amount and timing of dividends payable on Evergy's common stock are within the sole discretion of the Evergy Board.  The amount and timing of dividends declared by the Evergy Board will be dependent on considerations such as Evergy's earnings, financial position, cash flows, capitalization ratios, regulation, reinvestment opportunities and debt covenants.  Evergy targets a long-term dividend payout ratio of 60% to 70% of earnings.  See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information on the common stock dividend declared by the Evergy Board in February 2021.\nThe Evergy Companies also have certain restrictions stemming from statutory requirements, corporate organizational documents, covenants and other conditions that could affect dividend levels.  See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of restrictions on dividend payments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the ordinary course of business, Evergy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries.  Such agreements include, for example, guarantees and letters of credit.  These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiary's intended business purposes.  The majority of these agreements guarantee Evergy's own future performance, so a liability for the fair value of the obligation is not recorded.\nAt December 31, 2020, Evergy has provided $140.0 million of credit support for certain of its subsidiaries as follows:\n•\nEvergy direct guarantees to Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro counterparties for certain fuel supply contracts totaling $48.0 million, which expire in 2027; and\n•\nEvergy's guarantee of Evergy Missouri West long-term debt totaling $92.0 million, which includes debt with maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2023.\nEvergy has also guaranteed Evergy Missouri West's short-term debt, including its commercial paper program.  At December 31, 2020, Evergy Missouri West had $65.0 million of commercial paper outstanding.  None of the\n52\nguaranteed obligations are subject to default or prepayment if Evergy Missouri West's credit ratings were downgraded.\nThe Evergy Companies also have off-balance sheet arrangements in the form of letters of credit entered into in the ordinary course of business.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents Evergy's cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nEvergy's cash flows from operating activities increased $4.8 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily driven by:\n•\na $99.5 million increase due to the the timing of cash payments made to taxing authorities for property tax payments as well as various suppliers and other service providers for goods and services purchased in the ordinary course of business;\n•\na $64.3 million one-time refund made to certain Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West customers in 2019 reflecting customer benefits associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act;\n•\na $41.3 million increase in cash receipts for net tax refunds in 2020 primarily driven by a $57.2 million increase in refunds related to federal AMT credits;\n•\n$34.6 million in payments made for a Wolf Creek refueling outage in 2019;

    "text": "In the ordinary course of business, Evergy faces risks that are either non-financial or non-quantifiable.  Such risks principally include business, legal, operational and credit risks and are not represented in the following analysis.  See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7, MD&A for further discussion of risk factors.\nThe Evergy Companies are exposed to market risks associated with commodity price and supply, interest rates and security prices.  Commodity price risk is the potential adverse price impact related to the purchase or sale of electricity and energy-related products.  Credit risk is the potential adverse financial impact resulting from non-performance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations.  Interest rate risk is the potential adverse financial\n58\nimpact related to changes in interest rates.  In addition, Evergy's investments in trusts to fund nuclear plant decommissioning and to fund non-qualified retirement benefits give rise to security price risk.\nManagement has established risk management policies and strategies to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of the markets may have on Evergy's operating results.  During the ordinary course of business, the Evergy Companies' hedging strategies are reviewed to determine the hedging approach deemed appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation.  Though management believes its risk management practices are effective, it is not possible to identify and eliminate all risk.  Evergy could experience losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position, due to many factors, including unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in the energy markets, regulatory-driven market rule changes and/or bankruptcy or non-performance of customers or counterparties, and/or failure of underlying transactions that have been hedged to materialize.\nHedging Strategies\nFrom time to time, Evergy utilizes derivative instruments to execute risk management and hedging strategies.  Derivative instruments, such as futures, forward contracts, swaps or options, derive their value from underlying assets, indices, reference rates or a combination of these factors.  These derivative instruments include negotiated contracts, which are referred to as over-the-counter derivatives, and instruments listed and traded on an exchange.\nCommodity Price Risk\nThe Evergy Companies engage in the wholesale and retail sale of electricity as part of their regulated electric operations in addition to limited energy marketing activities.  These activities expose the Evergy Companies to risks associated with the price of electricity and other energy-related products.  Exposure to these risks is affected by a number of factors including the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers consume.  Customers' electricity usage could also vary from year to year based on the weather or other factors.  Quantities of fossil fuel used for generation vary from year to year based on the availability, price and deliverability of a given fuel type as well as planned and unplanned outages at facilities that use fossil fuels.  Evergy's exposure to fluctuations in these factors is limited by the cost-based regulation of its regulated operations in Kansas and Missouri as these operations are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through fuel recovery mechanisms.  While there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when they are recovered through rates, changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results.\nInterest Rate Risk\nEvergy manages interest rate risk and short- and long-term liquidity by limiting its exposure to variable interest rate debt to a percentage of total debt, diversifying maturity dates and, from time to time, entering into interest rate hedging transactions.  At December 31, 2020, 3% of Evergy's long-term debt was variable rate debt.  Evergy also has short-term borrowings and current maturities of fixed rate debt that are exposed to interest rate risk.  Evergy computes and presents information regarding the sensitivity to changes in interest rates for variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt by assuming a 100-basis-point change in the current interest rates applicable to such debt over the remaining time the debt is outstanding.\nEvergy had $1,038.7 million of variable rate debt, including notes payable, commercial paper and current maturities of fixed rate debt as of December 31, 2020.  A 100-basis-point change in interest rates applicable to this debt would impact income before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately $6.2 million.\nCredit Risk\nEvergy is exposed to counterparty credit risk largely in the form of accounts receivable from its retail and wholesale electric customers and through executory contracts with market risk exposure.  The credit risk associated with accounts receivable from retail and wholesale customers is largely mitigated by Evergy's large number of individual customers spread across diverse customer classes and the ability to recover bad debt expense in customer rates.  The Evergy Companies maintain credit policies and employ credit risk control mechanisms, such as letters of credit, when necessary to minimize their overall credit risk and monitor exposure.\n59\nInvestment Risk\nEvergy maintains trust funds, as required by the NRC, to fund its 94% share of decommissioning the Wolf Creek nuclear power plant and also maintains trusts to fund pension benefits as well as certain non-qualified retirement benefits.  As of December 31, 2020, these funds were primarily invested in a diversified mix of equity and debt securities and reflected at fair value on Evergy's balance sheet.  The equity securities in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the value of debt securities are exposed to changes in interest rates and other market factors.\nAs nuclear decommissioning costs are currently recovered in customer rates, Evergy defers both realized and unrealized gains and losses for these securities as an offset to its regulatory liability for decommissioning Wolf Creek and as such, fluctuations in the value of these securities do not impact earnings.  A significant decline in the value of pension or non-qualified retirement assets could require Evergy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods.  In addition, a decline in the fair value of these plan assets, in the absence of additional cash contributions to the plans by Evergy, could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods by Evergy.\n60"

    "text": "61\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Evergy, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Evergy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\").  In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRate Matters and Regulation - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Kansas Corporation Commission and by the Missouri Public Service Commission (collectively the \"Commissions\"), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric distribution companies in Kansas and Missouri, respectively.  Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation.  Accounting for the\n62\neconomics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant, and equipment, including asset retirements and abandonments; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; operating and maintenance expense; and depreciation expense.\nThe Company's rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight.  Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company's investment in the utility business.  Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates.  The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital.  Decisions to be made by the Commissions in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required.  While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\nWhen the Company retires a regulated plant, the Company must assess the probability of recovery of the regulated plant, which is dependent upon amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates, including any return.  Pending receipt of regulatory approval for the retirement and/or recovery of the affected plants, accounting for early retirements of regulated plants involves judgment related to the nature of the early retirement and the likelihood that the Company will recover its remaining investment in these retired generating plants with a return.  Auditing the judgments related to the nature and likelihood of the retirement and the probability of recovering the generating plant investment with a return involves especially subjective and complex judgment.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements.  Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) probability of potential charges related to the abandonment of regulated plants, and (3) a refund to customers.  Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities.\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates, including Company management's determination of the likelihood of recovery of the full investment of certain regulated plants and probability of refunding amounts previously collected from customers related to certain regulated plants.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n•\nWe evaluated external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.  Such external information included relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company and other public utilities in Kansas and Missouri, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available\n63\ninformation to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.\n•\nFor regulatory matters in process, including those that could impact the early retirement of regulated plants, we inspected the Company's filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors that may impact the Company's future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.\n•\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management's judgments for potential indicators of abandonment by performing the following:\n◦\nWe inquired of management about property, plant, and equipment that may be abandoned.\n◦\nWe inspected the capital projects budget and construction-in-process listings and inquired of management to identify projects that are designed to replace assets that may be retired prior to the end of the useful life.\n◦\nWe inspected minutes of the board of directors and regulatory orders and other filings with the Commissions to identify any evidence that may contradict management's assertion regarding probability of an abandonment.\n•\nWe compared actual spend for projects that have been capitalized to property, plant, and equipment to budget.  We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects.  For significant projects that were over budget or if full recovery of project costs is being challenged by intervenors, we evaluated management's assessment of the probability of a disallowance.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRate Matters and Regulation - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Kansas Corporation Commission (the \"Commission\"), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric distribution companies in Kansas.  Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation.  Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures,\n65\nsuch as property, plant, and equipment, including asset retirements and abandonments; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; operating and maintenance expense; and depreciation expense.\nThe Company's rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight.  Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company's investment in the utility business.  Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates.  The Commission's regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital.  While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commission will not approve (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or (2) recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\nWhen the Company retires a regulated plant, the Company must assess the probability of recovery of the regulated plant, which is dependent upon amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates, including any return.  Pending receipt of regulatory approval for the retirement and/or recovery of the affected plants, accounting for early retirements of regulated plants involves judgment related to the nature of the early retirement and the likelihood that the Company will recover its remaining investment in these retired generating plants with a return.  Auditing the judgments related to the nature and likelihood of the retirement and the probability of recovering the generating plant investment with a return involves especially subjective and complex judgment.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements.  Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) probability of potential charges related to the abandonment of regulated plants, and (3) a refund to customers.  Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commission, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commission included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities.\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n•\nWe evaluated external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.  Such external information included relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commission for the Company and other public utilities in Kansas, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commission's treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.\n•\nFor regulatory matters in process, including those that could impact the early retirement of regulated plants, we inspected the Company’s filings with the Commission and the filings with the Commission by\n66\ninterveners that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.\n•\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management's judgments for potential indicators of abandonment by performing the following:\n◦\nWe inquired of management about property, plant, and equipment that may be abandoned.\n◦\nWe inspected the capital projects budget and construction-in-process listings and inquired of management to identify projects that are designed to replace assets that may be retired prior to the end of the useful life.\n◦\nWe inspected minutes of the board of directors and regulatory orders and other filings with the Commission to identify any evidence that may contradict management's assertion regarding probability of an abandonment.\n•\nWe compared actual spend for projects that have been capitalized to property, plant, and equipment to budget.  We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects.  For significant projects that were over budget or if full recovery of project costs is being challenged by intervenors, we evaluated management's assessment of the probability of a disallowance.  We tested selected costs included in the capitalized project costs for completeness and accuracy.\n•\nWe evaluated management's analysis, and letters from internal and external legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nKansas City, Missouri\nFebruary 26, 2021\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.\n67\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholder and the Board of Directors of Evergy Metro, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Evergy Metro, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\").

Evergy operates primarily through the following wholly-owned direct subsidiaries listed below.\n•\nEvergy Kansas Central, Inc. (Evergy Kansas Central) is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Kansas.  Evergy Kansas Central has\none\nactive wholly-owned subsidiary with significant operations, Evergy Kansas South, Inc. (Evergy Kansas South).\n•\nEvergy Metro, Inc. (Evergy Metro) is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the states of Missouri and Kansas.\n•\nEvergy Missouri West, Inc. (Evergy Missouri West) is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Missouri.\n•\nEvergy Transmission Company, LLC (Evergy Transmission Company) owns\n13.5\n% of Transource Energy, LLC (Transource) with the remaining\n86.5\n% owned by AEP Transmission Holding Company, LLC, a subsidiary of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP).  Transource is focused on the development of competitive electric transmission projects.  Evergy Transmission Company accounts for its investment in Transource under the equity method.\nEvergy Kansas Central also owns a\n50\n% interest in Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC (Prairie Wind), which is a joint venture between Evergy Kansas Central and subsidiaries of AEP and Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company.  Prairie Wind owns a\n108\n-mile,\n345\nkV double-circuit transmission line that provides transmission service in the Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP).  Evergy Kansas Central accounts for its investment in Prairie Wind under the equity method.\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Kansas South, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West conduct business in their respective service territories using the name Evergy.  Collectively, the Evergy Companies have approximately\n15,400\nMWs of owned generating capacity and renewable power purchase agreements and engage in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately\n1.6\nmillion customers in the states of Kansas and Missouri.\nEvergy was incorporated in 2017 as Monarch Energy Holding, Inc. (Monarch Energy), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy Incorporated (Great Plains Energy).  Prior to the closing of the merger transactions described below, Monarch Energy changed its name to Evergy and did not conduct any business activities other than those required for its formation and matters contemplated by the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 9, 2017, by and among Great Plains Energy, Evergy Kansas Central, Monarch Energy and King Energy, Inc. (King Energy), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Monarch Energy (Amended Merger Agreement).  On June 4, 2018, in accordance with the Amended Merger Agreement, Great Plains Energy merged into Evergy, with Evergy surviving the merger and King Energy merged into Evergy Kansas Central, with Evergy Kansas Central\n86\nsurviving the merger.  These merger transactions resulted in Evergy becoming the parent entity of Evergy Kansas Central and the direct subsidiaries of Great Plains Energy, including Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West.  See Note 2 for additional information regarding the merger.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nEvergy Kansas Central was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the merger and thus, the predecessor of Evergy.  Evergy had separate operations for the period beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2018, and references to amounts for periods after the closing of the merger relate to Evergy.  The results of Great Plains Energy's direct subsidiaries have been included in Evergy's results of operations from the date of the closing of the merger and thereafter.\nEvergy Metro elected not to apply \"push-down accounting\" related to the merger, whereby the adjustments of assets and liabilities to fair value and the resulting goodwill would be recorded on the financial statements of the acquired subsidiary.  These adjustments for Evergy Metro, as well as those related to the acquired assets and liabilities of Great Plains Energy and its other direct subsidiaries, are only reflected on Evergy's consolidated financial statements.\nEach of Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's consolidated financial statements includes the accounts of their subsidiaries and variable interest entities (VIEs) of which they are the primary beneficiary.  Undivided interests in jointly-owned generation facilities are included on a proportionate basis.  Intercompany transactions have been eliminated.  The Evergy Companies assess financial performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis (i.e., operate in one segment).\nUse of Estimates\nThe process of preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain types of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.  Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements.  Accordingly, upon settlement, actual results may differ from estimated amounts.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at acquisition.\n87\nFuel Inventory and Supplies\nThe Evergy Companies record fuel inventory and supplies at average cost.\nThe following table separately states the balances for fuel inventory and supplies.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nThe Evergy Companies record the value of property, plant and equipment, including that of VIEs, at cost.  For plant, cost includes contracted services, direct labor and materials, indirect charges for engineering and supervision and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC).  AFUDC represents the allowed cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity.  AFUDC equity funds are included as a non-cash item in other income and AFUDC borrowed funds are a reduction of interest expense.  AFUDC is computed by applying a composite rate to qualified construction work in progress.  The rates used to compute gross AFUDC are compounded semi-annually.\nThe amounts of the Evergy Companies' AFUDC for borrowed and equity funds are detailed in the following table.\n(a)\nEvergy Metro amounts are included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.\nThe average rates used in the calculation of AFUDC are detailed in the following table.\n88\nWhen property units are retired or otherwise disposed, the original cost, net of salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation.  Repair of property and replacement of items not considered to be units of property are expensed as incurred, except for planned refueling and maintenance outages at Wolf Creek Generating Station (Wolf Creek).  As authorized by regulators, the incremental maintenance cost incurred for such outages is deferred and amortized to expense ratably over the period between planned outages.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization of utility plant other than nuclear fuel is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of depreciable property based on rates approved by state regulatory authorities.  Annual depreciation rates average approximately\n3\n%.  See Note 8 for more details.  Nuclear fuel is amortized to fuel expense based on the quantity of heat produced during the generation of electricity.\nThe depreciable lives of Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's property, plant and equipment are detailed in the following table.\nPlant to be Retired, Net\nWhen the Evergy Companies retire utility plant, the original cost, net of salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation.  However, when it becomes probable an asset will be retired significantly in advance of its original expected useful life and in the near term, the cost of the asset and related accumulated depreciation is recognized as a separate asset and a probable abandonment.  If the asset is still in service, the net amount is classified as plant to be retired, net on the consolidated balance sheets.  If the asset is no longer in service, the net amount is classified as a regulatory asset on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Evergy Companies must also assess the probability of full recovery of the remaining net book value of the abandonment.  The net book value that may be retained as an asset on the balance sheet for the abandonment is dependent upon amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates, including any return.  An impairment charge, if any, would equal the difference between the remaining net book value of the asset and the present value of the future revenues expected from the asset.\nEvergy Missouri West has determined that its November 2018 retirement of Sibley No. 3 Unit meets the criteria to be considered an abandonment.  As of December 31, 2020, Evergy has classified the remaining Sibley No. 3 Unit net book value of $\n128.4\nmillion as retired generation facilities within regulatory assets on its consolidated balance sheet.  This regulatory asset is reduced by approximately $\n9\nmillion of annual amortization expense, which is an amount equal to the annual depreciation expense for the asset reflected in retail rates.\nIn October 2019, the Missouri Public Service Commission (MPSC) granted the request of certain intervenors for an Accounting Authority Order (AAO) that requires Evergy Missouri West to record a regulatory liability for all revenues collected from customers for return on investment, non-fuel operations and maintenance costs, taxes including accumulated deferred income taxes and all other costs associated with Sibley Station following the station's retirement in November 2018 for consideration in Evergy Missouri West's next rate case, which is expected to be completed no later than the end of 2022.  See Note 5 for additional information regarding the AAO.\nEvergy Missouri West expects that the MPSC's decision in its next rate case regarding the AAO could impact the valuation of its regulatory asset for retired generation facilities but as of December 31, 2020, has concluded that no impairment is required based on the relevant facts and circumstances.\n89\nNuclear Plant Decommissioning Costs\nNuclear plant decommissioning cost estimates are based on either the immediate dismantlement method or the deferred dismantling method as determined by the State Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas (KCC) and MPSC and include the costs of decontamination, dismantlement and site restoration.  Based on these cost estimates, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro each contribute to a tax-qualified trust fund to be used to decommission Wolf Creek.  Related liabilities for decommissioning are included on Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's consolidated balance sheets in asset retirement obligations (AROs).\nAs a result of the authorized regulatory treatment and related regulatory accounting, differences between the decommissioning trust fund asset and the related ARO are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability.\nSee Note 7 for discussion of AROs including those associated with nuclear plant decommissioning costs.\nRegulatory Accounting\nAccounting standards are applied that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation.  Accordingly, regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded when required by a regulatory order or based on regulatory precedent.\nSee Note 5 for additional information concerning regulatory matters.\nCash Surrender Value of Life Insurance\nAmounts related to corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in other long-terms assets and are detailed in the following table for Evergy.\nSubstantially all of Evergy's COLI-related balances relate to Evergy Kansas Central's COLI activity.\nIncreases in cash surrender value and death benefits are recorded in other income in the Evergy Companies' consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.  Interest expense incurred on policy loans is offset against the policy income.  Income from death benefits is highly variable from period to period.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the following financial instruments for which it was practicable to estimate that value.\nNuclear decommissioning trust fund\n- The Evergy Companies' nuclear decommissioning trust fund assets are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices of the investments held by the fund and/or valuation models.\nPension plans\n- For financial reporting purposes, the market value of plan assets is the fair value based on quoted market prices of the investments held by the fund and/or valuation models.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Evergy Companies recognize revenue on the sale of electricity to customers over time as the service is provided in the amount they have the right to invoice.  Revenues recorded include electric services provided but not yet billed by the Evergy Companies.  Unbilled revenues are recorded for kWh usage in the period following the customers' billing cycle to the end of the month.  This estimate is based on net system kWh usage less actual billed kWhs.  The Evergy Companies' estimated unbilled kWhs are allocated and priced by regulatory jurisdiction across the rate classes based on actual billing rates.  The Evergy Companies' unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand, weather, line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes.  See Note 4 for the balance of unbilled receivables for each of Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n90\nThe Evergy Companies also collect sales taxes and franchise fees from customers concurrent with revenue-producing activities that are levied by state and local governments.  These items are excluded from revenue, and thus are not reflected on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro.\nSee Note 3 for additional details regarding revenue recognition from sales of electricity by the Evergy Companies.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nHistorical loss information generally provides the basis for the Evergy Companies' assessment of expected credit losses.  The Evergy Companies use an aging of accounts receivable method to assess historical loss information.  When historical experience may not fully reflect the Evergy Companies' expectations about the future, the Evergy Companies will adjust historical loss information, as necessary, to reflect the current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts not already reflected in the historical loss information.\nReceivables are charged off when they are deemed uncollectible, which is based on a number of factors including specific facts surrounding an account and management's judgment.\nProperty Gains and Losses\nNet gains and losses from the sale of assets and businesses and from asset impairments are recorded in operating expenses.\nAsset Impairments\nLong-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  If the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from an asset to be held and used is less than the carrying value of the asset, an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements.  The amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value.\nGoodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists.  The annual test must be performed at the same time each year.  The goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to identify potential impairment.  In the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value.\nSee Note 6 for additional details on goodwill.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset/liability approach.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Evergy Companies recognize tax benefits based on a \"more-likely-than-not\" recognition threshold.  In addition, the Evergy Companies recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.\nEvergy files a consolidated federal income tax return as well as unitary and combined income tax returns in several state jurisdictions with Kansas and Missouri being the most significant.  Income taxes for consolidated or combined subsidiaries are allocated to the subsidiaries based on separate company computations of income or loss.  Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's income tax provisions include taxes allocated based on their separate company's income or loss.\nThe Evergy Companies have established a net regulatory liability for future refunds to be made to customers for amounts collected from customers in excess of income taxes in current rates.  Tax credits are recognized in the year\n91\ngenerated except for certain Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West investment tax credits that have been deferred and amortized over the remaining service lives of the related properties.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe table below shows the detail of other expense for each of the Evergy Companies.\n(a)\nEvergy Metro amounts are only included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.\nEarnings Per Share\nTo compute basic earnings per share (EPS), Evergy divides net income attributable to Evergy, Inc. by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted EPS includes the effect of issuable common shares resulting from restricted share units (RSUs), performance shares and restricted stock.  Evergy computes the dilutive effects of potential issuances of common shares using the treasury stock method.\nThe following table reconciles Evergy's basic and diluted EPS.\nAnti-dilutive shares excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for 2020 and 2019 were\n127,884\nRSUs and\n785\nRSUs, respectively.  There were\nno\nanti-dilutive securities excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for 2018.\n92\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\n(a)\nEvergy Metro amounts are included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.\nNon-cash property, plant and equipment additions in 2020 for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro include a non-cash addition related to the revision in estimate of the Wolf Creek ARO liability in the third quarter of 2020.  See Note 7 for more details.\nSee Note 2 for the non-cash information related to the merger transaction in 2018, including the fair value of Great Plains Energy's assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the issuance of Evergy common stock.\nDividends Declared\nIn February 2021, Evergy's Board of Directors (Evergy Board) declared a quarterly dividend of $\n0.535\nper share on Evergy's common stock.  The common dividend is payable March 22, 2021, to shareholders of record as of March 8, 2021.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02,\nLeases\n, which requires an entity that is a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for lease payments on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.  Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.  Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged.  In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01,\nLeases: Land\n93\nEasement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842\n, which permits entities to elect an optional transition practical expedient to not evaluate under Topic 842 land easements that exist or expired before the entity's adoption of Topic 842 and that were not previously accounted for as leases under Topic 840.  In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10,\nCodification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases\n, which updates narrow aspects of the guidance issued in ASU No. 2016-02.  Also in July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11,\nLeases: Targeted Improvements\n, which provides an optional transition method that allows entities to initially apply Topic 842 at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption without restating prior periods.  In December 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-20,\nLeases: Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors\n, which is expected to reduce a lessor's implementation and ongoing costs associated with applying ASU No. 2016-02.  In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-01,\nLeases: Codification Improvements\n, which clarifies certain lessor accounting and interim reporting requirements.  ASU No. 2016-02 and the subsequent amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and requires a modified retrospective transition approach with an option to either adjust or not adjust comparative periods.\nThe Evergy Companies adopted the new guidance on January 1, 2019, without adjusting comparative periods for all leases existing as of January 1, 2019, by electing the optional transition method permitted by ASU No. 2018-11.  As a result, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro recorded an increase to assets and liabilities of approximately $\n110\nmillion, $\n40\nmillion and $\n80\nmillion, respectively, as of January 1, 2019.  Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro have certain lease transactions between them for which the related assets and liabilities are eliminated at consolidated Evergy.  The adoption of Topic 842 did not have a material impact on the Evergy Companies consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and there was no cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings.  The Evergy Companies also elected a practical expedient to forgo reassessing existing or expired contracts as leases to determine whether each is in scope of Topic 842 and to forgo reassessing lease classification for existing and expired leases.\n2.\nMERGER OF GREAT PLAINS ENERGY AND EVERGY KANSAS CENTRAL\nDescription of Merger Transaction\nOn June 4, 2018, Evergy completed the mergers contemplated by the Amended Merger Agreement.  As a result of the mergers, Great Plains Energy merged into Evergy, with Evergy surviving the merger and King Energy merged into Evergy Kansas Central, with Evergy Kansas Central surviving the merger.  Following the completion of these mergers, Evergy Kansas Central and the direct subsidiaries of Great Plains Energy, including Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West, became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Evergy.\nThe merger was structured as a merger of equals in a tax-free exchange of shares that involved no premium paid or received with respect to either Great Plains Energy or Evergy Kansas Central.  As a result of the closing of the merger transaction, each outstanding share of Great Plains Energy common stock was converted into\n0.5981\nshares of Evergy common stock and each outstanding share of Evergy Kansas Central common stock was converted into\n1\nshare of Evergy common stock.\n94\nAccounting Charges and Deferrals Related to the Merger\nThe following pre-tax reductions of revenue, expenses and deferral were recognized following the consummation of the merger and are included in the Evergy Companies' consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for 2018.\nReductions of revenue related to customer bill credits and expenses related to charitable contributions and community support were incurred as a result of conditions in the MPSC and KCC merger orders and were recorded as liabilities in the amounts presented above following the consummation of the merger.  Reductions of revenue for annual bill credits for Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's Kansas electric retail customers are recognized ratably in the twelve-month period preceding their payment.\nVoluntary severance and accelerated equity compensation represent costs related to payments for voluntary severance and change in control plans, as well as the recording of unrecognized equity compensation costs and the incremental fair value associated with the vesting of outstanding Evergy Kansas Central equity compensation awards upon the consummation of the merger.\nOther transaction and transition costs include merger success fees and fees for other outside services incurred.\nReallocation and deferral of merger transition costs represents the net reallocation of incurred merger transition costs between Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West and the subsequent deferral of these transition costs to a regulatory asset for future recovery in accordance with the KCC and MPSC merger orders.\n95\nPurchase Price\nBased on an evaluation of the provisions of ASC 805,\nBusiness Combinations\n, Evergy Kansas Central was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the merger.  Pursuant to the Amended Merger Agreement, Great Plains Energy's common stock shares were exchanged for Evergy common stock shares at the fixed exchange rate of\n0.5981\n.\nThe total consideration transferred in the merger is based on the closing stock price of Evergy Kansas Central on June 4, 2018, and is calculated as follows.\nGreat Plains Energy's equity compensation awards, including performance shares and restricted stock, were replaced by equivalent Evergy equity compensation awards subject to substantially the same terms and conditions upon the closing of the merger.  In accordance with the accounting guidance in ASC 805, a portion of the fair value of these awards is attributable to the purchase price as it represents consideration transferred in the merger.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nThe fair value of Great Plains Energy's assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of June 4, 2018, was determined based on significant estimates and assumptions that are judgmental in nature.  Third-party valuation specialists were engaged to assist in the valuation of these assets and liabilities.\nThe significant assets and liabilities recorded at fair values as of the merger date include long-term debt, asset retirement obligations, pension and post-retirement plans, accumulated deferred income tax liabilities and certain other long-term assets and liabilities.\nThe majority of Great Plains Energy's operations were subject to the rate-setting authority of the MPSC, the KCC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and were accounted for pursuant to GAAP, including the accounting guidance for regulated operations.  The rate-setting and cost recovery provisions for Great Plains Energy's regulated operations provided revenue derived from costs including a return on investment of assets and liabilities included in rate base.  Except for the significant assets and liabilities for which valuation adjustments were made as discussed above, the fair values of Great Plains Energy's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities subject to these rate-setting provisions approximated their carrying values and the assets and liabilities did not reflect any adjustments to these amounts other than for amounts not included in rate base.  The difference between the fair value and pre-merger carrying amounts for Great Plains Energy's long-term debt, asset retirement obligations and pension and post-retirement plans that were related to regulated operations were recorded as a regulatory asset or liability.  The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill as of the merger date.\n96\nThe final purchase price allocation to Great Plains Energy's assets and liabilities as of June 4, 2018, is detailed in the following table.\nImpact of Merger\nThe impact of Great Plains Energy's subsidiaries on Evergy's revenues in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2018 was an increase of $\n1,661.1\nmillion.  The impact of Great Plains Energy's subsidiaries on Evergy's net income attributable to Evergy in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for 2018 was an increase of $\n236.2\nmillion.\nEvergy had incurred total merger-related costs, including reductions of revenue for customer bill credits, of $\n148.0\nmillion for 2018.\nPro Forma Financial Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the consolidated results of operations of Evergy as if the merger transactions had taken place on January 1, 2018.  The unaudited pro forma information was calculated after applying Evergy's accounting policies and adjusting Great Plains Energy's results to reflect purchase accounting adjustments.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations that would have been achieved or the future consolidated results of operations of Evergy.\nEvergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Great Plains Energy incurred non-recurring costs and a gain directly related to the merger that have been excluded in the 2018 pro forma earnings presented above.  On an after-tax basis, these non-recurring merger-related costs and gain incurred by Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Great Plains Energy included:\n•\n$\n74.7\nmillion of certain after-tax merger-related transition and transaction costs;\n•\n$\n44.4\nmillion of after-tax reductions in operating revenues related to one-time customer bill credits; and\n•\n$\n36.6\nmillion of after-tax mark-to-market gains on interest rate swaps for which cash settlement was contingent upon the consummation of the merger.\n97\n3.\nREVENUE\nEvergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's revenues disaggregated by customer class are summarized in the following tables.\n(a)\nEvergy Metro amounts are included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.\n98\nRetail Revenues\nThe Evergy Companies' retail revenues are generated by the regulated sale of electricity to their residential, commercial and industrial customers within their franchised service territories.  The Evergy Companies recognize revenue on the sale of electricity to their customers over time as the service is provided in the amount they have a right to invoice.  Retail customers are billed monthly at the tariff rates approved by the KCC and MPSC based on customer kWh usage.\nRevenues recorded include electric services provided but not yet billed by the Evergy Companies.  Unbilled revenues are recorded for kWh usage in the period following the customers' billing cycle to the end of the month.  This estimate is based on net system kWh usage less actual billed kWhs.  The Evergy Companies' estimated unbilled kWhs are allocated and priced by regulatory jurisdiction across the rate classes based on actual billing rates.\nThe Evergy Companies also collect sales taxes and franchise fees from customers concurrent with revenue-producing activities that are levied by state and local governments.  These items are excluded from revenue, and thus not reflected on the statements of income and comprehensive income, for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro.\nWholesale Revenues\nThe Evergy Companies' wholesale revenues are generated by the sale of wholesale power and capacity in circumstances when the power that the Evergy Companies generate is not required for customers in their service territory.  These sales primarily occur within the SPP Integrated Marketplace.  The Evergy Companies also purchase power from the SPP Integrated Marketplace and record sale and purchase activity on a net basis in wholesale revenue or fuel and purchased power expense.  In addition, the Evergy Companies sell wholesale power and capacity through bilateral contracts to other counterparties, such as electric cooperatives, municipalities and other electric utilities.\nFor both wholesale sales to the SPP Integrated Marketplace and through bilateral contracts, the Evergy Companies recognize revenue on the sale of wholesale electricity to their customers over time as the service is provided in the amount they have a right to invoice.\nWholesale sales within the SPP Integrated Marketplace are billed weekly based on the fixed transaction price determined by the market at the time of the sale and the MWh quantity purchased.  Wholesale sales from bilateral contracts are billed monthly based on the contractually determined transaction price and the kWh quantity purchased.\nTransmission Revenues\nThe Evergy Companies' transmission revenues are generated by the use of their transmission networks by the SPP. To enable optimal use of the diverse generating resources in the SPP region, the Evergy Companies, as well as other transmission owners, allow the SPP to access and operate their transmission networks.  As new transmission lines are constructed, they are included in the transmission network available to the SPP.  In exchange for providing access, the SPP pays the Evergy Companies consideration determined by formula rates approved by FERC, which include the cost to construct and maintain the transmission lines and a return on investment.  The price for access to the Evergy Companies' transmission networks are updated annually based on projected costs.  Projections are updated to actual costs and the difference is included in subsequent year's prices.\nThe Evergy Companies have different treatment for their legacy transmission facilities within the SPP, which results in different levels of transmission revenue being received from the SPP.  Evergy Kansas Central's transmission revenues from SPP include amounts that Evergy Kansas Central pays to the SPP on behalf of its retail electric customers for the use of Evergy Kansas Central's legacy transmission facilities.  These transmission revenues are mostly offset by SPP network transmission cost expense that Evergy Kansas Central pays on behalf of its retail customers.  Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West do not pay the SPP for their retail customers’ use of the Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West legacy transmission facilities and correspondingly, their transmission revenues also do not reflect the associated transmission revenue from the SPP.\n99\nThe Evergy Companies recognize revenue on the sale of transmission service to their customers over time as the service is provided in the amount they have a right to invoice.  Transmission service to the SPP is billed monthly based on a fixed transaction price determined by FERC formula transmission rates along with other SPP-specific charges and the MW quantity purchased.\nIndustrial Steam and Other Revenues\nEvergy's industrial steam and other revenues are primarily generated by the regulated sale of industrial steam to Evergy Missouri West's steam customers.  Evergy recognizes revenue on the sale of industrial steam to its customers over time as the service is provided in the amount that it has the right to invoice.  Steam customers are billed on a monthly basis at the tariff rate approved by the MPSC based on customer MMBtu usage.\n4.\nRECEIVABLES\nThe Evergy Companies' receivables are detailed in the following table.\nThe Evergy Companies' other receivables at December 31, 2020 and 2019, consisted primarily of receivables from partners in jointly-owned electric utility plants, wholesale sales receivables and receivables related to alternative revenue programs.\nThe Evergy Companies' other receivables also included receivables from contracts with customers as summarized in the following table.\n100\nThe change in the Evergy Companies' allowance for credit losses is summarized in the following table.\nSale of Accounts Receivable\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West sell an undivided percentage ownership interest in their retail electric accounts receivable to independent outside investors.  These sales are accounted for as secured borrowings with accounts receivable pledged as collateral and a corresponding short-term collateralized note payable recognized on the balance sheets.\nThe Evergy Companies' accounts receivable pledged as collateral and the corresponding short-term collateralized note payable are summarized in the following table.\nEach receivable sale facility expires in September 2021.  Evergy Kansas Central's facility allows for $\n185.0\nmillion in aggregate outstanding principal amount of borrowings from mid-October through mid-June and then $\n200.0\nmillion from mid-June through the expiration date of the facility.  Evergy Metro's facility allows for $\n130.0\nmillion in aggregate outstanding principal amount of borrowings at any time.  Evergy Missouri West's facility allows for $\n50.0\nmillion in aggregate outstanding principal amount of borrowings from mid-November through mid-June and then $\n65.0\nmillion from mid-June through the expiration date of the facility.\n5.\nRATE MATTERS AND REGULATION\nKCC Proceedings\nEvergy Kansas Central 2020 Transmission Delivery Charge (TDC)\nIn March 2020, the KCC issued an order adjusting Evergy Kansas Central's retail prices to include updated transmission costs as reflected in the FERC transmission formula rate (TFR).  The new prices were effective in April 2020 and are expected to increase Evergy Kansas Central's annual retail revenues by $\n3.5\nmillion when compared to 2019.\n101\nEvergy Metro 2020 TDC\nIn April 2020, the KCC issued an order adjusting Evergy Metro's retail prices to include updated transmission costs as reflected in the FERC TFR.  The new prices were effective in May 2020 and are expected to decrease Evergy Metro's annual retail revenues by $\n2.7\nmillion when compared to 2019.\nEvergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro Earnings Review and Sharing Plan (ERSP)\nAs part of their merger settlement agreement with the KCC, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro agreed to participate in an ERSP for the years 2019 through 2022.  Under the ERSP, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's Kansas jurisdiction are required to refund to customers\n50\n% of annual earnings in excess of their authorized return on equity of\n9.3\n% to the extent the excess earnings exceed the amount of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's annual merger bill credits for the year being measured.\nEvergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's 2019 calculations of annual earnings did not exceed their authorized return on equity of\n9.3\n% and therefore did not result in any customer refund obligations.  These calculations were filed with the KCC in April 2020.  As of December 31, 2020, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro estimate their 2020 annual earnings will not result in a significant refund obligation.  The final refund obligations for 2020, if any, will be decided by the KCC and could vary from the current estimates.\nEvergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro COVID-19 AAO Request\nIn May 2020, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro filed a joint request for an AAO with the KCC that would allow for the extraordinary costs and lost revenues incurred by the companies, net of any COVID-19-related savings, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to be considered for future recovery from customers as part of their next rate cases.\nIn July 2020, the KCC granted Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's request for an AAO as discussed above.  As a result of the KCC's order, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro will record to a regulatory asset all net incremental costs incurred associated with the COVID-19 pandemic for consideration in their next rate cases, which are expected to be completed no later than the end of 2023.  Additionally, the KCC order states that the KCC will also consider granting the recovery of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's lost revenues associated with the COVID-19 pandemic as part of their next rate cases.  If granted, these lost revenues would be recognized prospectively as billed to customers in future rates.\nMPSC Proceedings\nEvergy Missouri West Other Proceedings\nIn December 2018, the Office of the Public Counsel (OPC) and the Midwest Energy Consumers Group (MECG) filed a petition with the MPSC requesting an AAO that would require Evergy Missouri West to record a regulatory liability for all revenues collected from customers for return on investment, non-fuel operations and maintenance costs, taxes including accumulated deferred income taxes, and all other costs associated with Sibley Station following the station’s retirement in November 2018.\nIn October 2019, the MPSC granted OPC's and MECG's request for an AAO and required Evergy Missouri West to record to a regulatory liability the revenues discussed above for consideration in Evergy Missouri West's next rate case, which is expected to be completed no later than the end of 2022.  Depending on the MPSC's decision in this next rate case, Evergy Missouri West could be required to refund to customers all or a portion of amounts collected in revenue for Sibley Station since December 2018 or, alternatively, could be required to make no refunds.\nAs a result of the MPSC order, Evergy has recorded a regulatory liability of $\n18.4\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 for the estimated amount of revenues that Evergy Missouri West has collected from customers for Sibley Station since December 2018 that Evergy has determined is probable of refund.  Evergy expects that it will continue to defer such amounts as collected from customers until new rates become effective in Evergy Missouri West's next rate case.\nThe accrual for this estimated amount does not include certain revenues collected related to Sibley Station that Evergy has determined to not be probable of refund in the next rate case based on the relevant facts and\n102\ncircumstances.  While Evergy has determined these additional revenues to not be probable of refund, the ultimate resolution of this matter in Evergy Missouri West's next rate case is uncertain and could result in an estimated loss of up to approximately $\n12\nmillion per year in excess of the amount accrued until Evergy Missouri West's new rates become effective.  Evergy's regulatory liability for probable refunds as of December 31, 2020 and estimated loss in excess of the amount accrued represent estimates that could change significantly based on ongoing developments including decisions in other regulatory proceedings that establish precedent applicable to this matter and positions of parties on this issue in a future Evergy Missouri West rate case.\nEvergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West COVID-19 AAO Request\nIn May 2020, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West filed a joint request for an AAO with the MPSC that would allow for the extraordinary costs and lost revenues incurred by the companies, net of any COVID-19-related savings, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to be considered for future recovery from customers as part of their next rate cases.\nIn October 2020, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West entered into a non-unanimous stipulation and agreement with the MPSC staff and other intervenors that would allow Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West to defer to a regulatory asset certain net incremental costs incurred associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.  The MPSC approved the AAO request in January 2021.  As a result of the MPSC's order, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West will record the net incremental costs to a regulatory asset for consideration in their next rate cases, which are expected to be filed in January 2022.\nFERC Proceedings\nIn October of each year, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro post an updated TFR that includes projected transmission capital expenditures and operating costs for the following year.  This rate is the most significant component in the retail rate calculation for Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's annual request with the KCC to adjust retail prices to include updated transmission costs through the TDC.\nEvergy Kansas Central TFR\nIn the most recent three years, the updated TFR was expected to adjust Evergy Kansas Central's annual transmission revenues by approximately:\n•\n$\n32.4\nmillion increase effective in January 2021;\n•\n$\n6.8\nmillion increase effective in January 2020; and\n•\n$\n11.2\nmillion decrease effective in January 2019.\nEvergy Metro TFR\nIn the most recent three years, the updated TFR was expected to adjust Evergy Metro's annual transmission revenues by approximately:\n•\n$\n3.9\nmillion decrease effective in January 2021;\n•\n$\n1.7\nmillion decrease effective in January 2020; and\n•\n$\n2.8\nmillion decrease effective in January 2019.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe Evergy Companies have recorded assets and liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process, which would not otherwise be recorded if they were not regulated.  Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues.  Regulatory liabilities represent future reductions in revenues or refunds to customers.\nManagement regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the MPSC, KCC or FERC in Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's rate case filings; decisions in other regulatory proceedings, including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to the Evergy Companies; and changes in laws and\n103\nregulations.  If recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations.  The Evergy Companies continued ability to meet the criteria for recording regulatory assets and liabilities may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry or changes in accounting rules.  In the event that the criteria no longer applied to any or all of the Evergy Companies' operations, the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism were provided.  Additionally, these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets.\nThe Evergy Companies' regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed in the following tables.\n104\nThe following summarizes the nature and period of recovery for each of the regulatory assets listed in the table above.\nPension and post-retirement costs:\nRepresents unrecognized gains and losses and prior service costs that will be recognized in future net periodic pension and post-retirement costs, pension settlements amortized over various periods and financial and regulatory accounting method differences that will be eliminated over the life of the pension plans.  Of these amounts, $\n806.3\nmillion, $\n412.9\nmillion and $\n333.6\nmillion for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro, respectively, are not included in rate base and are amortized over various periods.  Additionally, $\n250.1\nmillion, $(\n27.5\n) million and $\n137.6\nmillion for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro, respectively, represent differences between pension and post-retirement costs under GAAP and pension and post-retirement costs for ratemaking that will be recovered or refunded in future rates and differences in accumulated unrecognized gains and losses and prior service costs between Evergy and Evergy Metro due to Evergy Metro electing not to apply \"push-down accounting\" related to the merger.\nDebt reacquisition costs:\nIncludes costs incurred to reacquire and refinance debt.  These costs are amortized over the term of the new debt or the remaining lives of the old debt issuances if no new debt was issued and are not included in rate base.\nDebt fair value adjustment:\nRepresents purchase accounting adjustments recorded to state the carrying value of Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West long-term debt at fair value in connection with the merger.  Amount is amortized over the life of the related debt and is not included in rate base.\nAsset retirement obligations fair value adjustment:\nRepresents purchase accounting adjustments recorded to state the carrying value of Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West AROs at fair value in connection with the merger.  Amount is amortized over the life of the related plant and is not included in rate base.\nDepreciation:\nRepresents the difference between regulatory depreciation expense and depreciation expense recorded for financial reporting purposes.  These assets are included in rate base and the difference is amortized over the life of the related plant.\n105\nCost of removal:\nRepresents amounts spent, but not yet collected, to dispose of plant assets.  This asset will decrease as removal costs are collected in rates and is included in rate base.\nAsset retirement obligations:\nRepresents amounts associated with AROs as discussed further in Note 7.  These amounts are recovered over the life of the related plant and are not included in rate base.\nAnalog meter unrecovered investment:\nRepresents the deferral of unrecovered investment of retired analog meters.  Of this amount, $\n15.8\nmillion is not included in rate base for Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central and is being amortized over a\nfive\n-year period.\nTreasury yield hedges:\nRepresents the effective portion of treasury yield hedge transactions.  Amortization of this amount will be included in interest expense over the term of the related debt and is not included in rate base.\nIatan No. 1 and common facilities:\nRepresents depreciation and carrying costs related to Iatan No. 1 and common facilities.  These costs are included in rate base and amortized over various periods.\nIatan No. 2 construction accounting costs:\nRepresents the construction accounting costs related to Iatan No. 2.  These costs are included in rate base and amortized through 2059.\nKansas property tax surcharge:\nRepresents actual costs incurred for property taxes in excess of amounts collected in revenues.  These costs are expected to be recovered over a\none\n-year period and are not included in rate base.\nDisallowed plant costs:\nThe KCC originally disallowed certain costs related to the Wolf Creek plant.  In 1987, the KCC revised its original conclusion and provided for recovery of an indirect disallowance with no return on investment.  This regulatory asset represents the present value of the future expected revenues to be provided to recover these costs, net of the amounts amortized.\nLa Cygne environmental costs:\nRepresents the deferral of depreciation and amortization expense and associated carrying charges related to the La Cygne Station environmental project.

These amounts will be credited over various periods.\n6.\nGOODWILL\nAccounting rules require goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists.  Evergy's impairment test for the $\n2,336.6\nmillion of goodwill that was recorded as a result of the Great Plains Energy and Evergy Kansas Central merger was conducted as of May 1, 2020.  The goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to identify potential impairment.  In the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value.  Evergy's consolidated operations are considered\none\nreporting unit for assessment of impairment, as management assesses financial performance and allocates resources on a consolidated basis.  The determination of fair value of the reporting unit consisted of two valuation techniques: an income approach\n107\nconsisting of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach consisting of a determination of reporting unit invested capital using a market multiple derived from the historical earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and market prices of the stock of peer companies.  The results of the two techniques were evaluated and weighted to determine a point within the range that management considered representative of fair value for the reporting unit.  The fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, including goodwill.  As a result, there was no impairment of goodwill.\n7.\nASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\nAROs associated with tangible long-lived assets are legal obligations that exist under enacted laws, statutes and written or oral contracts, including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.  These liabilities are recognized at estimated fair value as incurred with a corresponding amount capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets and depreciated over their useful lives.  Accretion of the liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded to a regulatory asset and/or liability.  Changes in the estimated fair values of the liabilities are recognized when known.\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have AROs related to asbestos abatement and the closure and post-closure care of ponds and landfills containing coal combustion residuals (CCRs).  In addition, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro have AROs related to decommissioning Wolf Creek and the retirement of wind generation facilities.\nThe MPSC and KCC require the owners of Wolf Creek, including Evergy Kansas South and Evergy Metro with their respective 47% ownership shares, to submit an updated decommissioning cost study every three years.  The most recent study was submitted to the MPSC and KCC in September 2020.  As a result of changes in estimates related to the study, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro recorded increases to their AROs to decommission Wolf Creek of $\n259.1\nmillion, $\n140.7\nmillion and $\n118.4\nmillion, respectively, in 2020.\nThe following table summarizes the change in the Evergy Companies' AROs for the periods ending December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n108\n8.\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nThe following tables summarize the property, plant and equipment of Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro.\n(a)\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, represents the planned retirement of Evergy Kansas Central analog meters prior to the end of their remaining useful lives.\nThe following table summarizes the property, plant and equipment of VIEs for Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central.\nDepreciation Expense\nThe Evergy Companies' depreciation expense is detailed in the following table.\n(a)\nApproximately $\n7.1\nmillion of depreciation expense in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018 was attributable to property, plant and equipment of VIEs.\n(b)\nEvergy Metro amounts are only included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.\n109\n9.\nJOINTLY-OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITY PLANTS\nEvergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's share of jointly-owned electric utility plants at December 31, 2020, are detailed in the following tables.\n(a)\nThe VIE consolidated by Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central holds its\n50\n% leasehold interest in La Cygne Unit 2.  This\n50\n% leasehold interest in La Cygne Unit 2 is reflected in the information provided above.  See Note 19 for additional information.\n(a)\nThe VIE consolidated by Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central holds its\n50\n% leasehold interest in La Cygne Unit 2.  This\n50\n% leasehold interest in La Cygne Unit 2 is reflected in the information provided above.  See Note 19 for additional information.\nEach owner must fund its own portion of the plant's operating expenses and capital expenditures.  The Evergy Companies' share of direct expenses are included in the appropriate operating expense classifications in Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's consolidated financial statements.\n110\n10.\nPENSION PLANS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS\nEvergy and certain of its subsidiaries maintain, and Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro participate in, qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's employees as well as certain non-qualified plans covering certain active and retired officers.  Evergy is also responsible for its indirect\n94\n% ownership share of Wolf Creek's defined benefit plans, consisting of Evergy Kansas South's and Evergy Metro's respective\n47\n% ownership shares.\nFor the majority of employees, pension benefits under these plans reflect the employees' compensation, years of service and age at retirement.  However, for the plan covering Evergy Kansas Central's employees, the benefits for non-union employees hired between 2002 and the second quarter of 2018 and union employees hired beginning in 2012 are derived from a cash balance account formula.  The plan was closed to future non-union employees in 2018.  For the plans covering Evergy Metro's employees, the benefits for union employees hired beginning in 2014 are derived from a cash balance account formula and the plans were closed to future non-union employees in 2014.\nEvergy and its subsidiaries also provide certain post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all retired employees of Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro and their respective shares of Wolf Creek's post-retirement benefit plans.\nThe Evergy Companies record pension and post-retirement expense in accordance with rate orders from the KCC and MPSC that allow the difference between pension and post-retirement costs under GAAP and costs for ratemaking to be recognized as a regulatory asset or liability.  This difference between financial and regulatory accounting methods is due to timing and will be eliminated over the life of the plans.\nFor 2020, Evergy and Evergy Metro recorded pension settlement charges of $\n11.2\nmillion and $\n14.3\nmillion, respectively.  For 2019, Evergy and Evergy Metro recorded pension settlement charges of $\n15.6\nmillion and $\n23.0\nmillion, respectively.  These settlement charges were the result of accelerated pension distributions primarily related to voluntary severance programs.  Evergy and Evergy Metro deferred substantially all of the charges to a regulatory asset and expect to recover these amounts over future periods pursuant to regulatory agreements.\n111\nThe following pension benefits tables provide information relating to the funded status of all defined benefit pension plans on an aggregate basis as well as the components of net periodic benefit costs.  For financial reporting purposes, the market value of plan assets is the fair value.  Net periodic benefit costs reflect total plan benefit costs prior to the effects of capitalization and sharing with joint owners of power plants.\nEvergy Metro amounts are only included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.\n112\nActuarial losses for the Evergy Companies' pension benefit plans for 2020 and 2019 were primarily driven by a decrease in the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation of approximately\n70\nbasis points in each of 2020 and 2019 as a result of lower market interest rates.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Evergy's pension benefits include non-qualified benefit obligations of $\n52.1\nmillion and $\n49.4\nmillion, respectively, which are funded by trusts containing assets of $\n46.3\nmillion and $\n45.5\nmillion, respectively.  As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Evergy Kansas Central's pension benefits include non-qualified benefit obligations of $\n27.0\nmillion and $\n26.0\nmillion, respectively, which are funded by trusts containing\n113\nassets of $\n32.7\nmillion and $\n31.7\nmillion, respectively.\nThe assets in the aforementioned trusts are not included in the table above.  See Note 14 for more information on these amounts.\n114\nFor financial reporting purposes, the estimated prior service cost and net actuarial (gain) loss for the defined benefit plans are amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) or a regulatory asset into net periodic benefit cost.  The Evergy Companies amortize prior service cost on a straight-line basis over the average future service of the active employees (plan participants) benefiting under the plan.  Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central amortize the net actuarial (gain) loss on a straight-line basis over the average future service of active plan participants benefiting under the plan without application of an amortization corridor.  Evergy Metro amortizes the net actuarial (gain) loss on a rolling five-year average basis.\nPension and other post-retirement benefit plans with the PBO, accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) or accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligation (APBO) in excess of the fair value of plan assets at year-end are detailed in the following tables.\n115\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets represents the Evergy Companies' estimate of the long-term return on plan assets and is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plans' investment portfolios.  Assumed projected rates of return for each asset class were selected after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns of various asset classes.  Based on the target asset allocation for each asset class, the overall expected rate of return for the portfolios was developed and adjusted for the effect of projected benefits paid from plan assets and future plan contributions.\nThe following tables provide the weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs for the Evergy Companies' pension and post-retirement benefit plans.\n116\nEvergy expects to contribute $\n131.6\nmillion to the pension plans in 2021 to meet Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) funding requirements and regulatory orders, of which $\n41.2\nmillion is expected to be paid by Evergy Kansas Central and $\n90.4\nmillion is expected to be paid by Evergy Metro.  The Evergy Companies' funding policy is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the ERISA funding requirements and MPSC and KCC rate orders plus additional amounts as considered appropriate; therefore, actual contributions may differ from expected contributions.  Also in 2021, Evergy expects to contribute $\n4.1\nmillion to the post-retirement benefit plans, of which $\n0.6\nmillion is expected to be paid by Evergy Kansas Central and $\n3.5\nmillion is expected to be paid by Evergy Metro.\nThe following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid through 2030.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro each maintained separate trusts for both their qualified pension and post-retirement benefits.  These plans are managed in accordance with prudent investor guidelines contained in the ERISA requirements.\nThe primary objective of the Evergy Kansas Central pension plan is to provide a source of retirement income for its participants and beneficiaries, and the primary financial objective of the plan is to improve its funded status.  The primary objective of the Evergy Kansas Central post-retirement benefit plan is growth in assets and the preservation of principal, while minimizing interim volatility, to meet anticipated claims of plan participants.\n117\nThe primary objective of the Evergy Metro pension plans is to meet or exceed the target rate of return for the plan within a reasonable and prudent level of risk.  The primary objective of the Evergy Metro post-retirement benefit plans is to preserve capital, maintain sufficient liquidity and earn a consistent rate of return.\nThe investment strategies of both the Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro pension and post-retirement plans support the above objectives of the plans.  The portfolios are invested, and periodically rebalanced, to achieve the targeted allocations detailed below.\nThe following table provides the target asset allocations by asset class for the Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro pension and other post-retirement plan assets. [to be updated]\nFair Value Measurements\nEvergy classifies recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements based on the fair value hierarchy as discussed in Note 14.  The following are descriptions of the valuation methods of the primary fair value measurements disclosed below.\nDomestic equities -\nconsist of individually held domestic equity securities and domestic equity mutual funds.  Securities and funds, which are publicly quoted, are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized as Level 1.  Funds that are valued by fund administrators using the net asset value (NAV) per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nInternational equities -\nconsist of individually held international equity securities and international equity mutual funds.  Securities and funds, which are publicly quoted, are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized as Level 1.  Funds that are valued by fund administrators using the NAV per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nBond funds -\nconsist of funds maintained by investment companies that invest in various types of fixed income securities consistent with the funds' stated objectives.  Securities and funds, which are publicly quoted, are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized as Level 1.  Funds that are valued by fund administrators using the NAV per fund share, derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities, are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nCorporate bonds -\nconsists of individually held, primarily domestic, corporate bonds that are traded in less than active markets or priced with models using highly observable inputs that are categorized as Level 2.\nU.S. Treasury and agency bonds -\nconsists of individually held U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. agency bonds.  U.S. Treasury securities, which are publicly quoted, are valued based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized as a Level 1.  U.S. agency bonds, which are publicly quoted, are traded in less than active markets or priced with models using highly observable inputs and are categorized as Level 2.\nMortgage and asset backed securities -\nconsists of individually held securities that are traded in less than active markets or valued with models using highly observable inputs that are categorized as Level 2.\n118\nReal estate investments -\nconsists of traded real estate investment trusts valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the trusts are traded and are categorized as Level 1 and institutional trust funds valued at NAV per fund share and are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy.\nCombination debt/equity/other fund\n- consists of a fund that invests in various types of debt, equity and other asset classes consistent with the fund's stated objectives.  The fund, which is publicly quoted, is valued based on quoted prices in active markets and is categorized as Level 1.\nAlternative investments -\nconsists of investments in institutional trust and hedge funds that are valued by fund administrators using the NAV per fund share, derived from the underlying investments of the fund, and are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nShort-term investments\n- consists of fund investments in high-quality, short-term, U.S. dollar-denominated instruments with an average maturity of 60 days that are valued at NAV per fund share and are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy.\nCash and cash equivalents -\nconsists of investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased that are traded in active markets and are categorized as Level 1.\n119\nThe fair values of the Evergy Companies' pension plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, by asset category are in the following tables.\n120\n121\nThe fair values of the Evergy Companies' post-retirement plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, by asset category are in the following tables.\n122\nAssumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans.\nThe cost trend assumptions are detailed in the following tables.\nEmployee Savings Plans\nEvergy has defined contribution savings plans (401(k)) that cover substantially all employees.  Evergy matches employee contributions, subject to limits.  The annual costs of the plans are detailed in the following table.  Evergy Metro amounts are only included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.\n11.\nEQUITY COMPENSATION\nUpon the consummation of the merger, Evergy assumed both Evergy Kansas Central's Long-Term Incentive and Share Award plan (LTISA) and Great Plains Energy's Amended Long-Term Incentive Plan, which was renamed the Evergy, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan.  All outstanding share-based payment awards under Evergy Kansas Central's LTISA vested at the closing of the merger transaction and were converted into a right to receive Evergy common stock with the exception of certain RSUs and deferred director share units issued prior to the closing of the merger to certain directors, officers and employees of Evergy Kansas Central.  The vesting of these shares resulted in the recognition of $\n14.6\nmillion of compensation expense in Evergy's and Evergy Kansas Central's consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for 2018.\nAll of Great Plains Energy's outstanding performance shares, restricted stock, RSUs and director deferred share units under Great Plains Energy's Amended Long-Term Incentive Plan were converted into equivalent Evergy performance shares, restricted stock, RSUs and director deferred share units at Great Plains Energy's merger exchange ratio of\n0.5981\n.  See Note 2 for more information regarding the merger.\n123\nThe following table summarizes the Evergy Companies' equity compensation expense and the associated income tax benefit.\n(a)\nEvergy Metro amounts are only included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.\nRestricted Share Units\nEvergy has utilized RSUs for new grants of stock-based compensation awards subsequent to the merger.  RSU awards are grants that entitle the holder to receive shares of common stock as the awards vest.  These RSU awards are defined as nonvested shares and do not include restrictions once the awards have vested.  These RSUs either take the form of RSUs with performance measures that vest upon expiration of the award term or RSUs with only service requirements that vest solely upon the passage of time.  As of December 31, 2020, Evergy also had an insignificant amount of restricted stock and performance shares outstanding related to Great Plains Energy equity compensation awards that converted to equivalent Evergy awards at the closing of the merger transaction in 2018.  These remaining restricted stock and performance share awards will vest in the first quarter of 2021.\nRSUs with Performance Measures\nThe payment of RSUs with performance measures is contingent upon achievement of specific performance goals over a stated period of time as approved by the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Board.  The numbers of RSUs with performances measures ultimately paid can vary from the numbers of RSUs with performance measures initially granted depending on Evergy's performance over stated performance periods.  Compensation expense for RSUs with performance measures is calculated by recognizing the portion of the fair value for each reporting period for which the requisite service has been rendered.  Dividends are accrued over the vesting period and paid in cash based on the number of RSUs with performance measures ultimately paid.\nThe fair value of RSUs with performance measures is estimated using the market value of Evergy's stock at the valuation date and a Monte Carlo simulation technique that incorporates assumptions for inputs of expected volatilities, dividend yield and risk-free rates.  Expected volatility is based on daily stock price change during a historical period commensurate with the remaining term of the performance period of the grant.  The risk-free rate is based upon the rate at the time of the evaluation for zero-coupon government bonds with a maturity consistent with the remaining performance period of the grant.  The dividend yield is based on the most recent dividends paid and the actual closing stock price on the valuation date.  For shares granted in 2020, inputs for expected volatility, dividend yield and the risk-free rate were\n17\n%,\n2.93\n% and\n0.72\n%, respectively.\n124\nRSU activity for awards with performance measures for 2020 is summarized in the following table.\n* weighted-average\nAt December 31, 2020, the remaining weighted-average contractual term related to RSU awards with performance measures was\n1.7\nyears.  The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted with performance measures was $\n87.98\nand $\n37.87\nin 2020 and 2019, respectively.  At December 31, 2020, there was $\n17.5\nmillion of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs with performance measures.\nNo\nRSUs with performance measures vested in 2020 and 2019.\nRSUs with Only Service Requirements\nEvergy measures the fair value of RSUs with only service requirements based on the fair market value of the underlying common stock as of the grant date.  RSU awards with only service conditions recognize compensation expense by multiplying shares by the grant-date fair value related to the RSU and recognizing it on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, including for those RSUs that have a graded vesting schedule.  Nonforfeitable dividend equivalents, or the rights to receive cash equal to the value of dividends paid on Evergy's common stock, are paid on certain of these RSUs during the vesting period.  Nonforfeitable dividend equivalents are recorded directly to retained earnings.\nRSU activity for awards with only service requirements for 2020 is summarized in the following table.\n* weighted-average\nAt December 31, 2020, the remaining weighted-average contractual term related to RSU awards with only service requirements was\n1.3\nyears.  The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted with only service requirements was $\n68.92\n, $\n54.47\nand $\n52.16\nin 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  At December 31, 2020, there was $\n3.5\nmillion of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs.  The total fair value of RSUs with only service requirements that vested was $\n6.5\nmillion, $\n2.6\nmillion and $\n16.0\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n125\n12.\nSHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND SHORT-TERM BANK LINES OF CREDIT\nEvergy's $\n2.5\nbillion master credit facility expires in 2023.  Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have borrowing capacity under the master credit facility with specific sublimits for each borrower.  These sublimits can be unilaterally adjusted by Evergy for each borrower provided the sublimits remain within minimum and maximum sublimits as specified in the facility.  A default by any borrower under the facility or one of its significant subsidiaries on other indebtedness totaling more than $\n100.0\nmillion constitutes a default by that borrower under the facility.  Under the terms of this facility, each of Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West is required to maintain a total indebtedness to total capitalization ratio, as defined in the facility, of not greater than\n0.65\nto 1.00 at all times.  As of December 31, 2020, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West were in compliance with this covenant.\nThe following table summarizes the committed credit facilities (excluding receivable sale facilities discussed in Note 4) available to the Evergy Companies as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n126\n13.\nLONG-TERM DEBT\nThe Evergy Companies' long-term debt is detailed in the following tables.\n127\n(a)\nRate after amortizing gains/losses recognized in OCI on settlements of interest rate hedging instruments.\n(b)\nVariable rate.\n(c)\nEvergy's current maturities total as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, includes $\n4.4\nmillion and $\n4.3\nmillion, respectively, of fair value adjustments recorded in connection with purchase accounting for the merger transaction.\n(d)\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, does not include $\n50.0\nmillion and $\n21.9\nmillion of secured Series 2005 Environmental Improvement Revenue Refunding (EIRR) bonds because the bonds were repurchased in September 2015 and are held by Evergy Metro.\n(e)\nRepresents the fair value adjustments recorded at Evergy consolidated related to the long-term debt of Great Plains Energy, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West in connection with purchase accounting for the merger transaction.  This amount is not part of future principal payments and will amortize over the remaining life of the associated debt instruments.\n(f)\nOriginally issued by Great Plains Energy but assumed by Evergy, Inc. as part of the merger transaction.\n(g)\nEffectively secured pursuant to the General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust dated as of December 1, 1986, as supplemented (Evergy Metro Mortgage Indenture) through the issuance of collateral mortgage bonds to the trustee in 2019.\n128\nThe following table summarizes Evergy's and Evergy Kansas Central's long-term debt of VIEs.\nMortgage Bonds\nThe Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Kansas South mortgages each contain provisions restricting the amount of first mortgage bonds (FMBs) that could be issued by each entity.  Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Kansas South must be in compliance with such restrictions prior to the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness.  The amount of Evergy Kansas Central FMBs authorized by its Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated July 1, 1939, as supplemented, is subject to certain limitations as described below.  The amount of Evergy Kansas South FMBs authorized by the Evergy Kansas South Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated April 1, 1940, as supplemented and amended, is limited to a maximum of $\n3.5\nbillion, unless amended further.  FMBs are secured by utility assets.  Amounts of additional FMBs that may be issued are subject to property, earnings and certain restrictive provisions, except in connection with certain refundings, of each mortgage.  As of December 31, 2020, approximately $\n780.6\nmillion and $\n2,828.6\nmillion principal amounts of additional Evergy Kansas Central FMBs or Evergy Kansas South FMBs, respectively, could be issued under the most restrictive provisions of their mortgages.\nEvergy Metro has issued mortgage bonds under the Evergy Metro Mortgage Indenture, which creates a mortgage lien on substantially all Evergy Metro's utility plant.  Additional Evergy Metro bonds may be issued on the basis of\n75\n% of property additions or retired bonds.  As of December 31, 2020, approximately $\n4,733.1\nmillion principal amount of additional Evergy Metro mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage.\nEvergy Missouri West has issued mortgage bonds under the General Mortgage Indenture and Deed of Trust dated April 1, 1946, as supplemented, which creates a mortgage lien on a portion of Evergy Missouri West's utility plant.\nIn April 2020, Evergy Kansas Central issued, at a discount, $\n500.0\nmillion of\n3.45\n% FMBs, maturing in 2050 and issued a notice of redemption for its $\n250.0\nmillion of\n5.10\n% FMBs, which had an original maturity date of July 2020.  The proceeds from the issuance of Evergy Kansas Central's $\n500.0\nmillion of\n3.45\n% FMBs were used to redeem the $\n250.0\nmillion of\n5.10\n% FMBs in May 2020 and for general corporate purposes.\nIn May 2020, Evergy Metro issued, at a discount, $\n400.0\nmillion of\n2.25\n% Mortgage Bonds, maturing in 2030.  The proceeds from the issuance of Evergy Metro's $\n400.0\nmillion of\n2.25\n% Mortgage Bonds were used to repay a portion of Evergy Metro's borrowings under the master credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nSenior Notes\nUnder the terms of the note purchase agreements for certain Evergy Missouri West senior notes, Evergy Missouri West is required to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio, as defined in the agreements, not greater than 0.65 to 1.00.  In addition, Evergy Missouri West's priority debt, as defined in the agreements, cannot exceed 15% of consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreements.  At December 31, 2020, Evergy Missouri West was in compliance with these covenants.\n129\nScheduled Maturities\nEvergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's long-term debt maturities and the long-term debt maturities of VIEs for the next five years are detailed in the following table.\n(a)\nExcludes long-term debt maturities of VIEs.\n14.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nValues of Financial Instruments\nGAAP establishes a hierarchical framework for disclosing the transparency of the inputs utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value.  Management's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.  In addition, the Evergy Companies measure certain investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value at NAV, which are not included in the fair value hierarchy.  Further explanation of these levels and NAV is summarized below.\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices, such as equities listed on public exchanges.\nLevel 2 –  Pricing inputs are not quoted prices in active markets but are either directly or indirectly observable.  The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 2 are certain marketable debt securities, financial instruments traded in less than active markets or other financial instruments priced with models using highly observable inputs.\nLevel 3 – Significant inputs to pricing have little or no transparency.  The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation.\nNAV - Investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value are measured at NAV.  These investments do not consider the observability of inputs and, therefore, they are not included within the fair value hierarchy.  The Evergy Companies include in this category investments in private equity, real estate and alternative investment funds that do not have a readily determinable fair value.  The underlying alternative investments include collateralized debt obligations, mezzanine debt and a variety of other investments.\nThe Evergy Companies record cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and short-term borrowings on their consolidated balance sheets at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\nInterest Rate Derivatives\nThe Evergy Companies are exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest rates and may use derivative instruments to manage these risks.  From time to time, risk management activities may include entering into interest rate swap agreements to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions.  These interest rate swap agreements can be designated as cash flow hedges, in which case gains and losses on the interest rate swaps are deferred in other comprehensive income to be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period that the hedged interest payments affect earnings.  The Evergy Companies classify all cash inflows and outflows for interest rate swap agreements accounted for as cash flow hedges of forecasted debt transactions as financing activities on their consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn September 2019, Evergy issued $\n800.0\nmillion of\n2.90\n% Senior Notes maturing in 2029 and paid $\n69.8\nmillion to settle an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $\n500.0\nmillion that was designated as a cash\n130\nflow hedge of interest payments on the debt issuance. The $\n69.8\nmillion pre-tax loss was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on Evergy's consolidated balance sheet and is being reclassified to interest expense over the ten-year term of the debt.  For 2020, $\n7.0\nmillion and $(\n4.0\n) million were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense and income tax expense, respectively, on Evergy's consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  For 2019, $\n2.0\nmillion and $(\n0.5\n) million were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense and income tax expense, respectively, on Evergy's consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  As of December 31, 2020, Evergy expects to amortize $\n5.4\nmillion to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive loss over the next twelve months.\nFair Value of Long-Term Debt\nThe Evergy Companies measure the fair value of long-term debt using Level 2 measurements available as of the measurement date.\nThe book value and fair value of the Evergy Companies' long-term debt and long-term debt of variable interest entities is summarized in the following table.\n(a)\nIncludes current maturities.\n(b)\nBook value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, includes $\n110.4\nmillion and $\n125.5\nmillion, respectively, of fair value adjustments recorded in connection with purchase accounting for the Great Plains Energy and Evergy Kansas Central merger, which are not part of future principal payments and will amortize over the remaining life of the associated debt instrument.\n131\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe following tables include the Evergy Companies' balances of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\n132\n(a)\nFair value is based on quoted market prices of the investments held by the trust and/or valuation models.\n(b)\nFair value is based on quoted market prices of the investments held by the trust.  Debt securities classified as Level 1 are comprised of U.S. Treasury securities.  Debt securities classified as Level 2 are comprised of corporate bonds, U.S. Agency, state and local obligations, and other asset-backed securities.\n133\nCertain Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central investments included in the table above are measured at NAV as they do not have readily determinable fair values.  In certain situations, these investments may have redemption restrictions.\nThe following table provides additional information on these Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central investments.\n(a)\nThis investment is in\nfive\nlong-term private equity funds that do not permit early withdrawal.  Investments in these funds cannot be distributed until the underlying investments have been liquidated, which may take years from the date of initial liquidation.\nThree\nfunds have begun to make distributions.  The initial investment in the fourth and fifth funds occurred in 2016 and 2018, respectively.  The fourth fund's term is\n15\nyears, subject to the general partner's right to extend the term for up to\nthree\nadditional one-year periods.  The fifth fund's term is\n15\nyears, subject to additional extensions approved by a fund advisory committee to provide for an orderly liquidation of fund investments and dissolution of the fund.\n(b)\nThere is a holdback on final redemptions.\n(c)\nThis investment can be redeemed immediately and is not subject to any restrictions on redemptions.\nThe Evergy Companies hold equity and debt investments classified as securities in various trusts including for the purposes of funding the decommissioning of Wolf Creek and for the benefit of certain retired executive officers of Evergy Kansas Central.  The Evergy Companies record net realized and unrealized gains and losses on the nuclear decommissioning trusts in regulatory liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets and record net realized and unrealized gains and losses on the Evergy Companies' rabbi trusts in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\n134\nThe following table summarizes the net unrealized gains (losses) for the Evergy Companies' nuclear decommissioning trusts and rabbi trusts.\n(a)\nEvergy Metro amounts are included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.\n15.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nEnvironmental Matters\nSet forth below are descriptions of contingencies related to environmental matters that may impact the Evergy Companies' operations or their financial results.  Management's assessment of these contingencies, which are based on federal and state statutes and regulations, and regulatory agency and judicial interpretations and actions, has evolved over time.  These laws, regulations, interpretations and actions can also change, restrict or otherwise impact the Evergy Companies' operations or financial results.  The failure to comply with these laws, regulations, interpretations and actions could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties and/or the imposition of remedial requirements.  The Evergy Companies believe that all of their operations are in substantial compliance with current federal, state and local environmental standards.\nThere are a variety of final and proposed laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on the Evergy Companies' operations and consolidated financial results.  Due in part to the complex nature of environmental laws and regulations, the Evergy Companies are unable to assess the impact of potential changes that may develop with respect to the environmental contingencies described below.\nCross-State Air Pollution Update Rule\nIn September 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution (CSAPR) Update Rule.  The final rule addresses interstate transport of nitrogen oxides emissions in 22 states including Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma during the ozone season and the impact from the formation of ozone on downwind states with respect to the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  In December 2018, the EPA finalized a determination, known as the CSAPR Close-Out Rule, demonstrating the CSAPR Update Rule fully addressed certain upwind states' 2008 ozone NAAQS interstate transport obligations.  Various states and others have challenged both the CSAPR Update Rule and the CSAPR Close-Out Rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit).  In the fourth quarter of 2019, the D.C. Circuit granted these petitions and remanded a portion of the CSAPR Update Rule back to the EPA and vacated the CSAPR Close-Out Rule in its entirety.\nIn response to the remand by the D.C. Circuit, the EPA proposed the Revised Cross-State Air Pollution Rule Update for the 2008 Ozone NAAQS in October 2020.  The proposal finds that nine of the states that were subject to the CSAPR Update Rule do not significantly contribute to downwind states' nonattainment and/or maintenance issues during the ozone season, and that these states are therefore currently not subject to this proposed rule.  These nine states are Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Wisconsin.  The Evergy\n135\nCompanies will continue to monitor this proposed rule as any future changes to their NO\nx\nozone season allowance allocations could be material.\nGreenhouse Gases\nBurning coal and other fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n) and other gases referred to as greenhouse gases (GHG).  Various regulations under the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) limit CO\n2\nand other GHG emissions, and in addition, other measures are being imposed or offered by individual states, municipalities and regional agreements with the goal of reducing GHG emissions.\nIn July 2019, the EPA published the final Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule in the Federal Register.  This rule contained (1) emission guidelines for GHG emissions from existing electric utility generating units (EGUs) and (2) revisions to emission guideline implementing regulations.  This rule defined the \"best system of emission reduction\" (BSER) for GHG emissions from existing coal-fired EGUs as on-site, heat-rate efficiency improvements.  The final rule also provided states with a list of candidate technologies that can be used to establish standards of performance and incorporate these performance standards into state plans.  In conjunction with the finalization of the ACE rule, the EPA repealed its previously adopted Clean Power Plan (CPP).  In January 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the ACE rule back to the EPA.  Absent an approved request for rehearing, the mandate becomes effective on March 12, 2021.  In February 2021, the D.C. Circuit granted a motion filed by the EPA for a partial stay of its January 2021 vacatur discussed above.  The partial stay leaves the vacatur of the ACE rule in place while staying the mandate that vacates the repeal of the CPP.  As a result of the partial stay, neither the ACE rule nor the CPP will be in effect while the EPA forms a new rule to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.\nDue to uncertainty regarding the future of the CPP or any other GHG regulation, the Evergy Companies cannot determine the impact of the rule on their operations or consolidated financial results, but the cost to comply with the ACE rule, CPP, or other potential GHG rule, could be material.\nWater\nThe Evergy Companies discharge some of the water used in generation and other operations containing substances deemed to be pollutants.  A November 2015 EPA rule establishes effluent limitations guidelines (ELG) and standards for wastewater discharges, including limits on the amount of toxic metals and other pollutants that can be discharged.  Implementation timelines for this 2015 rule vary from 2018 to 2023.  In April 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit (5th Circuit) issued a ruling that vacates and remands portions of the original ELG rule.  Due to this ruling, future ELG modifications for the best available technology economically achievable for the discharge of legacy wastewater and leachate are likely and could be material.\nIn October 2020, the EPA published the final ELG reconsideration rule.  This rule adjusts numeric limits for flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater and adds a 10% volumetric purge limit for bottom ash transport water.  The timeline for final FGD wastewater compliance is now as soon as possible on or after one year following publication of the final rule in the Federal Register but no later than December 31, 2025.  The Evergy Companies have reviewed the regulation and the costs to comply with these changes are not expected to be material.\nRegulation of Coal Combustion Residuals\nIn the course of operating their coal generation plants, the Evergy Companies produce coal combustion residuals (CCRs), including fly ash, gypsum and bottom ash.  The EPA published a rule to regulate CCRs in April 2015 that requires additional CCR handling, processing and storage equipment and closure of certain ash disposal units.\nIn March 2019, the D.C. Circuit issued a ruling to grant the EPA's request to remand the Phase I, Part I CCR rule in response to a prior court ruling requiring the EPA to address un-lined surface impoundment closure requirements.  In August 2020, the EPA published the Part A CCR Rule.  This rule reclassified clay-lined surface impoundments from \"lined\" to \"un-lined\" and established a deadline of April 11, 2021 to initiate closure.  The prior rule included a deadline of October 31, 2020 for un-lined impoundments to initiate closure.  In November 2020, the EPA published the final Part B CCR Rule.  This rule includes a process to allow un-lined impoundments to continue to operate if a demonstration is made to prove that the un-lined impoundments are not adversely impacting groundwater, human\n136\nhealth or the environment.  The Evergy Companies currently plan to initiate closure of all un-lined impoundments by the deadline in the Part A CCR rule and therefore the Part B CCR rule is not expected to have a material impact.\nThe Evergy Companies have recorded AROs for their current estimates for the closure of ash disposal ponds, but the revision of these AROs may be required in the future due to changes in existing CCR regulations, the results of groundwater monitoring of CCR units or changes in interpretation of existing CCR regulations or changes in the timing or cost to close ash disposal ponds.  If revisions to these AROs are necessary, the impact on the Evergy Companies' operations or consolidated financial results could be material.\nStorage of Spent Nuclear Fuel\nUnder the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel.  In 2010, the DOE filed a motion with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to withdraw its application to construct a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  The NRC has not yet issued a final decision on the matter.\nWolf Creek is constructing a dry cask storage facility to expand its existing on-site spent nuclear fuel storage, which is expected to provide additional capacity by the end of 2021.  The Evergy Companies expect that the majority of the costs to construct the dry cask storage facility that would not have otherwise been incurred had the DOE begun accepting spent nuclear fuel will be reimbursed by the DOE.  The Evergy Companies cannot predict, when, or if, an off-site storage site or alternative disposal site will be available to receive Wolf Creek's spent nuclear fuel and will continue to monitor this activity.\nNuclear Insurance\nNuclear liability, property and accidental outage insurance is maintained for Wolf Creek.  These policies contain certain industry standard terms, conditions and exclusions, including, but not limited to, ordinary wear and tear and war.  An industry aggregate limit of $\n3.2\nbillion for nuclear events ($\n1.8\nbillion of non-nuclear events) plus any reinsurance, indemnity or any other source recoverable by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), provider of property and accidental outage insurance, exists for acts of terrorism affecting Wolf Creek or any other NEIL insured plant within 12 months from the date of the first act.  In addition, participation is required in industry-wide retrospect assessment programs as discussed below.\nNuclear Liability Insurance\nPursuant to the Price-Anderson Act, liability insurance includes coverage against public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the required limit of public liability, which is approximately $\n13.8\nbillion.  This limit of liability consists of the maximum available commercial insurance of $\n0.5\nbillion and the remaining $\n13.3\nbillion is provided through mandatory participation in an industry-wide retrospective assessment program.  Under this retrospective assessment program, the owners of Wolf Creek are jointly and severally subject to an assessment of up to $\n137.6\nmillion (Evergy's share is $\n129.4\nmillion and each of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's is $\n64.7\nmillion), payable at no more than $\n20.5\nmillion (Evergy's share is $\n19.2\nmillion and each of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's is $\n9.6\nmillion) per incident per year per reactor for any commercial U.S. nuclear reactor qualifying incident.  Both the total and yearly assessment is subject to an inflationary adjustment based on the Consumer Price Index and applicable premium taxes.  In addition, the U.S. Congress could impose additional revenue-raising measures to pay claims.\nNuclear Property and Accidental Outage Insurance\nThe owners of Wolf Creek carry decontamination liability, nuclear property damage and premature nuclear decommissioning liability insurance for Wolf Creek totaling approximately $\n2.8\nbillion.  Insurance coverage for non-nuclear property damage accidents total approximately $\n2.3\nbillion.  In the event of an extraordinary nuclear accident, insurance proceeds must first be used for reactor stabilization and site decontamination in accordance with a plan mandated by the NRC.  The Evergy Companies' share of any remaining proceeds can be used to pay for property damage or, if certain requirements are met, including decommissioning the plant, toward a shortfall in the nuclear decommissioning trust fund.  The owners also carry additional insurance with NEIL to help cover costs of replacement power and other extra expenses incurred during a prolonged outage resulting from accidental property damage at Wolf Creek.  If significant losses were incurred at any of the nuclear plants insured under the NEIL\n137\npolicies, the owners of Wolf Creek may be subject to retrospective assessments under the current policies of approximately $\n33.2\nmillion (Evergy's share is $\n31.2\nmillion and each of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's is $\n15.6\nmillion).\nNuclear Insurance Considerations\nAlthough the Evergy Companies maintain various insurance policies to provide coverage for potential losses and liabilities resulting from an accident or an extended outage, the insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the costs that could result from a catastrophic accident or extended outage at Wolf Creek.  Any substantial losses not covered by insurance, to the extent not recoverable in prices, would have a material effect on the Evergy Companies' consolidated financial results.\nContractual Commitments -\nFuel, Power and Other\nThe Evergy Companies' contractual commitments at December 31, 2020, excluding pensions, long-term debt and leases, are detailed in the following tables.  See Notes 10, 13 and 21 for information regarding pension, long-term debt and lease commitments, respectively.\nFuel commitments consist of commitments for nuclear fuel, coal and coal transportation.  Power commitments consist of certain commitments for renewable energy under power purchase agreements, capacity purchases and firm transmission service.  Other represents individual commitments entered into in the ordinary course of business.\n16.\nGUARANTEES\nIn the ordinary course of business, Evergy and certain of its subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries.  Such agreements include, for example, guarantees and letters of credit.  These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiary's intended business purposes.  The majority of these agreements guarantee Evergy's own future performance, so a liability for the fair value of the obligation is not recorded.\n138\nAt December 31, 2020, Evergy has provided $\n140.0\nmillion of credit support for certain of its subsidiaries as follows:\n•\nEvergy direct guarantees to Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro counterparties for certain fuel supply contracts totaling $\n48.0\nmillion, which expire in 2027; and\n•\nEvergy's guarantee of Evergy Missouri West long-term debt totaling $\n92.0\nmillion, which includes debt with maturity dates ranging from 2021 to 2023.\nEvergy has also guaranteed Evergy Missouri West's commercial paper program.  At December 31, 2020, Evergy Missouri West had $\n65.0\nmillion of commercial paper outstanding.  None of the guaranteed obligations are subject to default or prepayment if Evergy Missouri West's credit ratings were downgraded.\n17.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS\nIn the normal course of business, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West engage in related party transactions with one another.  A summary of these transactions and the amounts associated with them is provided below.\nJointly-Owned Plants and Shared Services\nEmployees of Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro manage Evergy Missouri West's business and operate its facilities at cost, including Evergy Missouri West's\n18\n% ownership interest in Evergy Metro's Iatan Nos. 1 and 2.  Employees of Evergy Kansas Central manage Jeffrey Energy Center (JEC) and operate its facilities at cost, including Evergy Missouri West's\n8\n% ownership interest in JEC.  Employees of Evergy Metro manage La Cygne Station and operate its facilities at cost, including Evergy Kansas Central's\n50\n% interest in La Cygne Station.  Employees of Evergy Metro and Evergy Kansas Central also provide one another with shared service support, including costs related to human resources, information technology, accounting and legal services.\nThe operating expenses and capital costs billed for jointly-owned plants and shared services are detailed in the following table.\n(a)\nTransactions between Evergy Kansas Central and either Evergy Metro or Evergy Missouri West are included from June 4, 2018, the date of\nthe closing of the merger, and thereafter.\nMoney Pool\nEvergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West are authorized to participate in the Evergy, Inc. money pool, which is an internal financing arrangement in which funds may be lent on a short-term basis to Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West from Evergy, Inc. and between Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West.  At December 31, 2020, Evergy Metro had a $\n100.0\nmillion outstanding receivable from Evergy Missouri West and\nno\noutstanding payables under the money pool.  At December 31, 2019, Evergy Metro had\nno\noutstanding receivables or payables under the money pool.\n139\nRelated Party Net Receivables and Payables\nThe following table summarizes Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's related party net receivables and payables.\nTax Allocation Agreement\nEvergy files a consolidated federal income tax return as well as unitary and combined income tax returns in several state jurisdictions with Kansas and Missouri being the most significant.  Income taxes for consolidated or combined subsidiaries are allocated to the subsidiaries based on separate company computations of income or loss.\nThe following table summarizes Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's income taxes receivable from (payable to) Evergy.\nLeases\nEvergy Metro leases certain transmission equipment from Evergy Kansas Central.  This lease was entered into prior to the merger in an arms-length transaction and is accounted for as an operating lease.  The right-of-use asset related to this lease is recorded within other long-term assets and the current and long-term lease liabilities are recorded within other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet.  The assets and liabilities related to this lease between Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro are eliminated at consolidated Evergy.\nThe following table summarizes Evergy Metro's right-of-use assets and related liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet.\n18.\nSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nEvergy's authorized capital stock consists of\n600\nmillion shares of common stock, without par value, and\n12\nmillion shares of Preference Stock, without par value.\n140\nEvergy Registration Statements\nIn November 2018, Evergy filed an automatic shelf registration statement providing for the sale of unlimited amounts of securities with the SEC, which expires in November 2021.\nEvergy has registered shares of its common stock with the SEC for its Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan.  Shares issued under the plan may be either newly issued shares or shares purchased on the open market.\nEvergy has registered shares of its common stock with the SEC for the Evergy, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan.  Shares issued under the plans may be either newly issued shares or shares purchased on the open market.\nSecurities Purchase Agreement\nOn February 25, 2021, Evergy entered into a securities purchase agreement, by and between Evergy and an affiliate of Bluescape Energy Partners, LLC (Bluescape).  Bluescape has agreed to purchase\n2,269,447\nshares of Evergy’s common stock for approximately $\n113.2\nmillion and will receive a warrant to purchase up to\n3,950,000\nadditional shares of Evergy’s common stock, in each case subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.  The warrant will have a term of\nthree years\nand an exercise price equal to $\n64.70\n.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nIn July 2018, the Evergy Board authorized the repurchase of up to\n60\nmillion shares of Evergy's common stock with no expiration date.  Following its authorization, Evergy utilized various methods to effectuate the share repurchase program, including the repurchase of shares through accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements and open market transactions.  In total, Evergy repurchased $\n2,671.0\nmillion, or\n45.2\nmillion shares, of common stock under the repurchase program.  Evergy retires repurchased common stock shares in the period the shares are repurchased.\nThe following table summarizes the ASRs completed as part of Evergy's common stock repurchase program.\nUnder the ASR agreements entered into with various financial institutions, Evergy was delivered a number of shares of its common stock based on the amount of the ASR agreement and the average daily volume-weighted average price of its common stock during the term of the ASR agreement, less a negotiated discount.  Evergy reflects ASRs as a repurchase of common stock in the period the shares are delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to its own common stock.  Evergy's ASRs met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification and therefore were not accounted for as derivative instruments.\nDividend Restrictions\nEvergy depends on its subsidiaries to pay dividends on its common stock.  The Evergy Companies have certain restrictions stemming from statutory requirements, corporate organizational documents, covenants and other conditions that could affect dividend levels or the ability to pay dividends.\nThe KCC order authorizing the merger transaction requires Evergy to maintain consolidated common equity of at least\n35\n% of total consolidated capitalization.\nUnder the Federal Power Act, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West generally can pay dividends only out of retained earnings.  Certain conditions in the MPSC and KCC orders authorizing the merger\n141\ntransaction also require Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro to maintain consolidated common equity of at least\n40\n% of total capitalization.  Other conditions in the MPSC and KCC merger orders require Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West to maintain credit ratings of at least investment grade.  If Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's or Evergy Missouri West's credit ratings are downgraded below the investment grade level as a result of their affiliation with Evergy or any of Evergy's affiliates, the impacted utility shall not pay a dividend to Evergy without KCC or MPSC approval or until the impacted utility's investment grade credit rating has been restored.\nThe master credit facility of Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West and the note purchase agreements for certain Evergy Missouri West senior notes contain covenants requiring the respective company to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization ratio of not more than\n0.65\nto 1.00 at all times.\nAs of December 31, 2020, all of Evergy's and Evergy Kansas Central's retained earnings and net income were free of restrictions and Evergy Metro had a retained earnings restriction of $\n385.6\nmillion.  As of December 31, 2020, Evergy's subsidiaries had restricted net assets of approximately $\n5.7\nbillion.  These restrictions are not expected to affect the Evergy Companies' ability to pay dividends at the current level for the foreseeable future.\n19.\nVARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nIn determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Evergy Companies assess the entity's purpose and design, including the nature of the entity's activities and the risks that the entity was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders.  A reporting enterprise is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE.  The trust holding an\n8\n% interest in JEC was a VIE until the expiration of a purchase option in July 2017 and then became a VIE again during 2019 until the\n8\n% interest was purchased by Evergy Kansas Central in August 2019.  The trust holding Evergy Kansas Central's\n50\n% interest in La Cygne Unit 2 is a VIE and Evergy Kansas Central remains the primary beneficiary of the trust.\nAll involvement with entities by the Evergy Companies is assessed to determine whether such entities are VIEs and, if so, whether or not the Evergy Companies are the primary beneficiaries of the entities.  The Evergy Companies also continuously assess whether they are the primary beneficiary of the VIE with which they are involved.  Prospective changes in facts and circumstances may cause identification of the primary beneficiary to be reconsidered.\n8\n% Interest in JEC\nUnder an agreement that expired in August 2019, Evergy Kansas Central leased an\n8\n% interest in JEC from a trust.  The trust was financed with an equity contribution from an owner participant and debt issued by the trust.  The trust was created specifically to purchase the\n8\n% interest in JEC and lease it to a third party and did not hold any other assets.  Evergy Kansas Central met the requirements to be considered the primary beneficiary of the trust until July 2017, when a contractual option to purchase the\n8\n% interest in the plant covered by the lease expired.  Accordingly, Evergy Kansas Central deconsolidated the trust in 2017.  Evergy Kansas Central then reconsolidated the trust as a VIE in the first quarter of 2019 following an agreement with the owner to purchase the\n8\n% interest in JEC from the trust in August 2019.  Evergy Kansas Central deconsolidated the trust for the final time following the closing of this purchase in August 2019.\n50\n% Interest in La Cygne Unit 2\nUnder an agreement that expires in September 2029, Evergy Kansas Central entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with a trust under which the trust purchased Evergy Kansas Central's\n50\n% interest in La Cygne Unit 2 and subsequently leased it back to Evergy Kansas Central.  The trust was financed with an equity contribution from an owner participant and debt issued by the trust.  The trust was created specifically to purchase the\n50\n% interest in La Cygne Unit 2 and lease it back to Evergy Kansas Central and does not hold any other assets.  Evergy Kansas Central meets the requirements to be considered the primary beneficiary of the trust.  In determining the primary\n142\nbeneficiary of the trust, Evergy Kansas Central concluded that the activities of the trust that most significantly impact its economic performance and that Evergy Kansas Central has the power to direct include (1) the operation and maintenance of the\n50\n% interest in La Cygne Unit 2 and (2) Evergy Kansas Central's ability to exercise a purchase option at the end of the agreement at the lesser of fair value or a fixed amount.  Evergy Kansas Central has the potential to receive benefits from the trust that could potentially be significant if the fair value of the\n50\n% interest in La Cygne Unit 2 at the end of the agreement is greater than the fixed amount.\nThe following table summarizes the assets and liabilities related to the VIE described above that are recorded on Evergy's and Evergy Kansas Central's consolidated balance sheets.\n(a)\nIncluded in accrued interest on Evergy's and Evergy Kansas Central's consolidated balance sheets.\nAll of the liabilities noted in the table above relate to the purchase of the property, plant and equipment of the VIE.  The assets of the VIE can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE and the VIE's debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central.  Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central have not provided financial or other support to the VIE and are not required to provide such support.  Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central did not record any gain or loss upon the initial consolidation of the VIE.\n20.\nTAXES\nComponents of income tax expense are detailed in the following tables.\n143\n(a)\nEvergy Metro amounts are included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.\nEffective Income Tax Rates\nEffective income tax rates reflected in the financial statements and the reasons for their differences from the statutory federal rates are detailed in the following tables.\n144\n(a)\nEvergy Metro amounts are included in consolidated Evergy from June 4, 2018, the date of the closing of the merger, and thereafter.\n145\nDeferred Income Taxes\nThe tax effects of major temporary differences resulting in deferred income tax assets (liabilities) in the consolidated balance sheets is in the following table.\nTax Credit Carryforwards\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, Evergy had $\n379.6\nmillion and $\n379.0\nmillion, respectively, of federal general business income tax credit carryforwards.  At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Evergy Kansas Central had $\n176.5\nmillion and $\n168.8\nmillion, respectively, of federal general business income tax credit carryforwards.  At December 31, 2020 and 2019, Evergy Metro had $\n195.9\nmillion and $\n203.2\nmillion, respectively, of federal general business income tax credit carryforwards.  The carryforwards for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro relate primarily to wind production tax credits and advanced coal investment tax credits and expire in the years 2020 to 2040.  Approximately $\n0.2\nmillion of Evergy's credits are related to Low Income Housing credits that were acquired in Great Plains Energy's acquisition of Evergy Missouri West.  Due to federal limitations on the utilization of income tax attributes acquired in the Evergy Missouri West acquisition, Evergy expects a portion of these credits to expire unutilized and has provided a valuation allowance against $\n0.2\nmillion of the federal income tax benefit.\n146\nThe year of origin of Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's related tax benefit amounts for federal tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2020 are detailed in the following table.\nAt December 31, 2019, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro had $\n169.9\nmillion, $\n168.5\nmillion and $\n1.2\nmillion, respectively, of tax benefits related to state income tax credit carryforwards.  The state income tax credits relate primarily to the Kansas high performance incentive program tax credits.  As a result of the exemption from Kansas state income tax beginning in 2021, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro wrote down their Kansas state income tax credit carryforwards in 2020, which were primarily offset by a corresponding decrease in unamortized investment tax credit liability.\nNet Operating Loss Carryforwards\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, Evergy had $\n42.2\nmillion and $\n132.4\nmillion, respectively, of tax benefits related to federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards.  At December 31, 2019, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro had $\n12.3\nmillion and $\n56.2\nmillion, respectively, of tax benefits related to federal NOL carryforwards.  Approximately $\n7.1\nmillion of Evergy's tax benefits at December 31, 2020\nare\nrelated to NOLs that were acquired in the Evergy Missouri West acquisition.  Due to federal limitations on the utilization of income tax attributes acquired in the Evergy Missouri West acquisition, Evergy expects a portion of these federal NOL carryforwards to expire unutilized and has provided a valuation allowance against $\n7.1\nmillion of the federal income tax benefit.  The federal NOL carryforwards expire in years 2023 to 2024.\n147\nThe year of origin of Evergy's related tax benefit amounts for federal NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2020 are detailed in the following table.\nIn addition, Evergy also had deferred tax benefits of $\n8.8\nmillion\nand $\n31.0\nmillion related to state NOLs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Evergy Kansas Central had deferred tax benefits of $\n10.8\nmillion related to state NOLs as of December 31, 2019.  Evergy Metro had deferred tax benefits of $\n0.2\nmillion and $\n5.7\nmillion related to state NOLs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The state NOL carryforwards expire in years 2021 to 2038.  Evergy does not expect to utilize $\n7.1\nmillion of NOLs before the expiration date of the carryforwards of NOLs in certain states.  Therefore, a valuation allowance has been provided against $\n7.1\nmillion of state tax benefits.\nAlternative Minimum Tax Carryforwards\nAt December 31, 2019, Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central had $\n37.9\nmillion and $\n13.4\nmillion, respectively, of federal AMT carryforwards.\nValuation Allowances\nEvergy is required to assess the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets using a \"more likely than not\" assessment threshold.  This assessment takes into consideration tax planning strategies within Evergy's control.  As a result of this assessment, Evergy has established a partial valuation allowance for federal and state tax NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.  During 2020, $\n3.1\nmillion of tax benefit was recorded in continuing operations primarily related to utilization or expiration of certain state NOL carryforwards.\nKansas Tax Reform\nIn May 2020, the state of Kansas exempted certain public utilities, including Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro, from Kansas corporate income tax beginning in 2021 and authorized the KCC to approve changes in rates related to increases or decreases in federal or state income tax rates.\nAs a result of the exemption from Kansas corporate income tax, the Evergy Companies revalued their deferred income tax assets and liabilities in May 2020.  Evergy decreased its net deferred income tax liabilities by $\n233.8\nmillion, primarily consisting of a $\n400.4\nmillion adjustment for the revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities included in rate base and a $\n31.7\nmillion tax gross-up adjustment on this amount for ratemaking purposes and $\n13.8\nmillion of income tax expense primarily related to the revaluation of deferred income taxes that will not be recovered from customers in future rates; partially offset by a decrease to unamortized investment tax credits of $\n183.6\nmillion due to the revaluation of certain Kansas income tax credits and a $\n16.9\nmillion tax gross-up adjustment on this amount for ratemaking purposes.\nEvergy Kansas Central decreased its net deferred income tax liabilities by $\n17.6\nmillion, primarily consisting of a $\n293.7\nmillion adjustment for the revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities included in rate base and a $\n17.3\nmillion tax gross-up adjustment on this amount for ratemaking purposes; partially offset by a decrease to unamortized investment tax credits of $\n183.6\nmillion due to the revaluation of certain Kansas income tax credits and a $\n16.9\nmillion tax gross-up adjustment on this amount for ratemaking purposes and $\n109.0\nmillion of income tax expense primarily related to the revaluation of deferred income taxes that will not be recovered from customers in future rates.\nEvergy Metro decreased its net deferred income tax liabilities by $\n152.9\nmillion, primarily consisting of a $\n106.7\nmillion adjustment for the revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities included in rate base and a $\n14.4\n148\nmillion tax gross-up adjustment on this amount for ratemaking purposes and $\n32.2\nmillion of income tax benefit primarily related to the revaluation of deferred income taxes that will not be refunded to customers in future rates.\nThe changes to the Evergy Companies' net deferred income tax liabilities included in rate base were offset by corresponding changes in regulatory liabilities.  The net regulatory liabilities will be refunded to customers in future rates by amortizing the amounts related to plant assets over the remaining useful life of the assets, and amortizing the amounts related to other items over a period to be determined in a future rate case.  The changes to the Evergy Companies' unamortized investment tax credits were related to the portion of certain Kansas income tax credits that are not expected to be used after December 31, 2020.  The amounts of income tax expense (benefit) recognized by the Evergy Companies related to the revaluation of deferred income taxes that will not be recovered from or refunded to customers in future rates primarily pertain to deferred tax adjustments related to the difference between Evergy's consolidated tax rate and the statutory tax rates used for setting rates at Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West as well as deferred income tax adjustments related to non-regulated operations.\nEvergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro currently recover the cost of Kansas corporate income taxes in rates from their customers at the statutory rate of\n7\n% that will be effective until 2021, when the income tax exemption established by the state of Kansas takes effect.  In accordance with the provisions of the income tax exemption, Evergy Metro and Evergy Kansas Central filed a joint application with the KCC in July 2020 to reduce their retail rates to reflect their exemption from Kansas corporate income taxes.  In the joint application, Evergy Metro requested to implement its rate reduction in one phase, effective January 1, 2021, and Evergy Kansas Central requested to implement its rate reduction in three phases, effective January 1 in each of 2021, 2022 and 2023.  In November 2020, the KCC approved Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's joint application.\nMissouri Tax Reform\nOn June 1, 2018, the Missouri governor signed Senate Bill (S.B.) 884 into law.  Most notably, S.B. 884 reduces the corporate income tax rate from 6.25% to 4.0% beginning in 2020, provides for the mandatory use of the single sales factor formula and eliminates intercompany transactions between corporations that file a consolidated Missouri income tax return.\nAs a result of the change in the Missouri corporate income tax rate, Evergy Metro revalued and restated its deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of June 1, 2018.  Evergy Metro decreased its net deferred income tax liabilities by $\n46.6\nmillion, primarily consisting of a $\n28.8\nmillion adjustment for the revaluation and restatement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities included in Missouri jurisdictional rate base and a $\n9.9\nmillion tax gross-up adjustment for ratemaking purposes.  The decrease to Evergy Metro's net deferred income tax liabilities included in Missouri jurisdictional rate base were offset by a corresponding increase in regulatory liabilities.  The net regulatory liabilities will be amortized to customers over a period to be determined in a future rate case.\nEvergy Metro recognized $\n15.5\nmillion of income tax benefit in 2018 primarily related to the difference between Evergy Metro's revaluation of its deferred income tax assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount of the revaluation pertaining to Evergy Metro's Missouri jurisdictional rate base.\n21.\nLEASES\nThe Evergy Companies lease office buildings, computer equipment, vehicles, rail cars, generating plant and other property and equipment, including rail cars to serve jointly-owned generating units where Evergy Kansas Central or Evergy Metro is the managing partner and is reimbursed by other joint-owners for the other owners' proportionate share of the costs.\nUnder GAAP, a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration.  The Evergy Companies assess a contract as being or containing a lease if the contract identifies property, plant and equipment, provides the lessee the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the property, plant and equipment and provides the lessee the right to direct the use of the property, plant and equipment.\nThe Evergy Companies have entered into several agreements to purchase energy through renewable purchase power agreements that are accounted for as leases that commenced prior to the application of Topic 842.\nDue to the\n149\nintermittent nature of renewable generation, these leases have significant variable lease payments not included in the initial and subsequent measurement of the lease liability.  Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred.  In addition, certain other contracts contain payment for activity that transfers a separate good or service such as utilities or common area maintenance.  The Evergy Companies have elected a practical expedient permitted by GAAP to not separate such components of the lease from other lease components for all leases.\nThe Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro leases have remaining terms ranging from\n1\nto\n18\nyears,\n1\nto\n18\nyears and\n1\nto\n25\nyears, respectively.  Leases that have original lease terms of twelve months or less are not recognized on the Evergy Companies’ balance sheets.\nSome leases have options to renew the lease or terminate early at the election of the Evergy Companies.  Judgment is applied at lease commencement to determine the reasonably certain lease term based on then-current assumptions about use of the leased asset, market conditions and terms in the contract.\nThe judgment applied to determine the lease term can significantly impact the measurement of the lease liability and right-of-use asset and lease classification.\nThe Evergy Companies typically discount lease payments over the term of the lease using their incremental borrowing rates at lease commencement to measure its initial and subsequent lease liability.  For leases that existed at the initial application of Topic 842, the Evergy Companies used the incremental borrowing rates that corresponded to the remaining lease term as of January 1, 2019.\nLeases may be classified as either operating leases or finance leases.  The lease classification is based on assumptions of the lease term and discount rate, as discussed above, and the fair market value and economic life of the leased asset.  Operating leases recognize a consistent expense each period over the lease term, while finance leases will result in the separate presentation of interest expense on the lease liability and amortization of the right-of-use asset.  Finance leases are treated as operating leases for rate-making purposes and as such, the Evergy Companies defer to a regulatory asset or liability any material differences between expense recognition and the timing of payments in order to match what is being recovered in customer rates.\nThe Evergy Companies’ lease expense is detailed in the following table.\n150\nSupplemental cash flow information related to the Evergy Companies' leases is detailed in the following table.\n151\nFinance Leases\nRight-of-use assets for finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment on the Evergy Companies’ balance sheets.  Lease liabilities for finance leases are included in other current and other long-term liabilities.\nPayments and other supplemental information for finance leases as of December 31, 2020, are detailed in the following table.\n152\nOperating Leases\nRight-of-use assets for operating leases are included in other long-term assets on the Evergy Companies’ balance sheets.  Lease liabilities for operating leases are included in other current and other long-term liabilities.\nLease payments and other supplemental information for operating leases as of December 31, 2020, are detailed in the following table.\n22.\nQUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS (UNAUDITED)\n153\nQuarterly data is subject to seasonal fluctuations with peak periods occurring in the summer months."

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nKansas City, Missouri\nFebruary 26, 2021\n156\nEVERGY KANSAS CENTRAL\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nEvergy Kansas Central carried out an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act).  This evaluation was conducted under the supervision, and with the participation, of Evergy Kansas Central's management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and Evergy Kansas Central's disclosure committee.  Based upon this evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Evergy Kansas Central have concluded as of the end of the period covered by this report that the disclosure controls and procedures of Evergy Kansas Central were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in Evergy Kansas Central’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarterly period ended December 31, 2020, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for Evergy Kansas Central.  Under the supervision and with the participation of Evergy Kansas Central’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, management evaluated the effectiveness of Evergy Kansas Central’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.
