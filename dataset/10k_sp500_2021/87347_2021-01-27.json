    "text": "All references in this report to “Registrant,” “Company,” “Schlumberger,” “we” or “our” are to Schlumberger Limited (Schlumberger N.V.) and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nSchlumberger is a technology company that partners with customers to access energy by providing leading digital solutions and deploying innovative technologies to enable performance and sustainability for the global energy industry.  Schlumberger collaborates to create technology that unlocks access to energy for the benefit of all.\nOrganizational Structure\nDuring 2020, Schlumberger restructured its organization in order to prepare for a changing industry future.  This new structure is aligned with customer workflows and is directly linked to Schlumberger’s corporate strategy, a key element of which is customer collaboration.\nThe new organization consists of four Divisions that combine and integrate Schlumberger’s technologies, enhancing the portfolio of capabilities that support the emerging long-term growth opportunities in each of these market segments.\nThe four Divisions are:\nThe role of the Divisions is to support Schlumberger in executing its customer-centric performance strategy and maintaining its industry leadership role in technology development and services integration.  The Divisions are collectively responsible for driving performance throughout their respective business lines; overseeing operational processes, resource allocation and personnel; and delivering superior financial results.\nDigital & Integration\n– Combines Schlumberger’s software and seismic businesses with its integrated offering of Asset Performance Solutions (“APS”).  APS helps develop or redevelop fields while increasing production, improving cash flow, and extending recovery for customers by providing fit-for-purpose solutions.  Through digital solutions and technologies, supported by the future of software, digital, infrastructure, connected assets, and data, this Division enhances efficiency to improve asset and enterprise-wide performance for customers.\nThe primary offerings comprising this Division are:\nAPS creates alignment between Schlumberger and the asset holder and/or the operator by Schlumberger receiving remuneration in line with its value creation.  These projects are generally focused on developing and co-managing production of customer assets under long-term agreements.  Schlumberger invests its own services and products and, in certain historical cases, cash into the field development activities and operations.  Although in certain arrangements Schlumberger is paid for a\n3\nportion of the services or products it provides, generally Schlumberger will not be paid at the time of providing its services or upon delivery of its products.  Instead, Schlumberger is generally compensated based on cash flow generated or on a fee-per-barrel basis.  This includes certain arrangements whereby Schlumberger is only compensated based on incremental production that it helps deliver above a mutually agreed baseline.\nReservoir Performance\n– Consists of reservoir-centric technologies and services that are critical to optimizing reservoir productivity and performance. Reservoir Performance develops and deploys innovative technologies and services to evaluate, intervene, and stimulate reservoirs that help customers understand subsurface assets and maximize their value.\nThe primary offerings comprising this Division are:\nOn December 31, 2020, Schlumberger contributed its onshore hydraulic fracturing business in the United States and Canada (“OneStim\n®\n”), including its pressure pumping, pumpdown perforating, and Permian frac sand businesses, to Liberty Oilfield Services Inc. (“Liberty”), in exchange for a 37% equity interest in Liberty.  OneStim’s historical results were reported as part of the Reservoir Performance Division through the closing of the transaction.\nWell Construction\n– Combines the full portfolio of products and services to optimize well placement and performance, maximize drilling efficiency, and improve wellbore assurance.  Well Construction provides operators and drilling rig manufacturers with services and products related to designing and constructing a well.\nThe primary offerings comprising this Division are:\nProduction Systems\n– Develops technologies and provides expertise that enhance production and recovery from subsurface reservoirs to the surface, into pipelines, and to refineries.  Production Systems provides a comprehensive portfolio of equipment and services including subsurface production systems, subsea and surface equipment and services, and midstream production systems.\n4\nThe primary offerings comprising this Division are:\nSupporting the Divisions is a global network of research and engineering centers, through which Schlumberger advances its technology programs to enhance industry efficiency and sustainability, lower finding and producing costs, improve productivity, maximize reserve recovery and increase asset value, while accomplishing these goals safely.\nThe Divisions are deployed around a geographical structure of five Basins:  Americas Land, Offshore Atlantic, Middle East and North Africa, Asia, and Russia and Central Asia.  The Basins are a collection of GeoUnits, which consist of a single country to several countries, that each have common themes in terms of strategy, economic and operational drivers, and technology needs.  With a strong focus on the customer and growth, the Basins are responsible for defining a Basin strategy in line with Schlumberger’s corporate strategy and identifying opportunities for future growth.\nCorporate Strategy\nSchlumberger’s ambition is to be its customers’ “performance partner” of choice, by putting the customer at the center of everything it does and by being the company that defines performance in the energy services industry.  Schlumberger’s strategy is structured around three major themes: (i) strengthen the core; (ii) expand the go-to-market; and (iii) next horizons of growth.\nStrengthen the Core\nStrengthening the core is focused on developing our people, collaborating with our customers and enhancing our technology performance to enable Schlumberger’s vision of customer performance.  Maintaining capital discipline is also a key element of strengthening the core—such as evaluating all investment decisions through the lens of return on capital rather than growth and evolving certain businesses into innovative models that are less capital intensive.\nExpand the Go-to-Market\nSchlumberger believes that a key shift in the industry is the greater prominence and interplay of regional, or basin-specific, supply and demand.  The industry is witnessing a decoupling of the activity characteristics of each major region, resulting in a unique set of dynamics for each oil and gas basin across the world.\nThere are four main regions increasingly competing against each other for market access to meet global, regional and domestic energy demand: North America Land; Middle East; Russia and Central Asia; and offshore.  These regions correspond to a different set of resource plays or basins, each facing different economic and operational drivers, which translates into different activity levels and cycles.  Current geopolitical uncertainties and trade conflicts will only amplify this trend, resulting in the transition from a global market toward a more localized supply and demand dynamic.\n5\nAs basins around the world decouple, a key differentiator for Schlumberger will be its “fit-for-basin” approach and ability.  Basins have significantly different dynamics, including technological needs, in-country value, and market or technology access.  Schlumberger is developing and deploying basin-specific technology that helps its customers overcome the challenges of their respective regions.  In-country value enables regional efficiency and performance, while increasing local content and aligning with the strategic priorities of\nour clients\n.\nAdditionally, by employing different business models, Schlumberger will evolve the way it goes to market in certain regions. Schlumberger will seek to monetize its technology advantage by deploying alternative operating models such as selling or leasing selected technologies to regional service providers with a license to operate in these specific markets.  Schlumberger expects this approach to expand its total addressable market.\nNext Horizons of Growth\nSchlumberger’s history and culture have been based on leadership, science and innovation since its founders invented wireline logging as a technique for obtaining downhole data in oil and gas wells.  Continuing this tradition, Schlumberger will focus its future growth in two areas: digital innovation and new energy.\nSchlumberger seeks to define the future of digital technology in the energy industry.  The application of digital technology in field operations has the potential to deliver a step-change in operational workflows to significantly elevate performance. To take the next step in performance that our customers need to deliver energy in today’s competitive environment, Schlumberger is developing and using digital solutions, focused on generating richer data and better insights, that will achieve performance not previously possible across the energy industry.\nSchlumberger is leveraging its portfolio of proprietary digital technologies as well as technologies that have transformed other industries to enable our customers to make better and faster decisions.  Integrating digital technology into exploration and production (“E&P”) workflows requires extensive domain expertise in upstream hardware and software technologies and in the management and interpretation of vast amounts of subsurface and production data.  Schlumberger will continue to lead the digital transformation of the energy industry by applying its unique data and digital expertise to every facet of the E&P life cycle.\nThrough its New Energy portfolio, Schlumberger is investing in low carbon and carbon-neutral energy technologies that will provide a platform for future sustainable growth.  Schlumberger recognizes that its future will expand beyond oil and gas with the energy transition, and consequently the Company is positioning for significant growth opportunities for the long term.  Schlumberger New Energy is taking a business venture approach that will focus on energy efficiency and energy storage as a priority, aimed at developing unique positions in adjacent markets and introducing breakthrough technologies in energy verticals beyond oil and gas.  Schlumberger will utilize its domain expertise in areas adjacent to its existing activities where it can deliver at scale with its global footprint and execution platform.\n6\nHuman Capital\nAt December 31, 2020, Schlumberger employed approximately 86,000 people representing more than 160 nationalities.\nSchlumberger believes that the diversity of its workforce is one of its greatest strengths and aims to maintain its employee population diversity in proportion to the revenue derived from the countries in which it works.\nSchlumberger recognizes that its ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain a highly competent and diverse workforce has been key to its success for many decades.  As a service company, Schlumberger believes it is critical for its people to communicate with its customers in their native languages and to share the values of the people in the countries where it works.  Furthermore, Schlumberger’s diverse workforce is better able to respond to, and deliver services and products that meet the unique expectations and requirements of, its stakeholders, including customers, suppliers and stockholders.  Schlumberger’s long-standing commitment to national and cultural diversity fosters a culture that is global in outlook, yet local in practice, which permeates every layer of the Company.\nIn addition to national and cultural diversity, achieving improved gender balance has been a focus of policy and action in Schlumberger since the late 1970s, when it began recruiting women for field operations roles.  Since then, Schlumberger has continued to expand opportunities for women across its field operations, technology, business and management roles.  Schlumberger believes that these gender diversity initiatives help it maintain its competitive advantage.\nSchlumberger set its first gender balance target in 1994, with the goal of having women comprise 15% of its salaried workforce by 2015.  This goal was achieved ahead of schedule in 2011.  Schlumberger’s current gender balance goal is to have women comprise 25% of the Company’s salaried workforce by 2025.  In 2020, women made up approximately 23% of the Company’s salaried employee population. Additionally, approximately 21% of management roles were held by women in 2020.\nSchlumberger is proud of its meritocratic culture, its commitment to early responsibility and internal promotion, and its “borderless career” philosophy.  Schlumberger strives to identify top talent within the Company, and to provide opportunities for employees who demonstrate exceptional competency and performance to progress to higher levels within the organization.  Schlumberger seeks to nurture its talent pool to maximize each employee’s developmental potential through a combination of training and experience.  Schlumberger’s “borderless career” philosophy means it supports flexible career paths, helping employees develop their skills across different functions, businesses and geographies.  These opportunities accelerate career development while fostering an agile workforce and the next generation of business leaders.\n7\nCompetition\nThe principal methods of competition within the energy services industry are technological innovation, quality of service and price differentiation.  These vary geographically with respect to the different services and products that Schlumberger offers.  Schlumberger has numerous competitors, both large and small.\nIntellectual Property\nSchlumberger owns and controls a variety of intellectual property, including but not limited to patents, proprietary information and software tools and applications that, in the aggregate, are material to Schlumberger’s business.  While Schlumberger seeks and holds numerous patents covering various products and processes, no particular patent or group of patents is material to Schlumberger’s business.\nSeasonality\nSeasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the delivery of Schlumberger’s products and services.  For example, the spring thaw in Canada and consequent road restrictions can affect activity levels, while the winter months in the North Sea, Russia and China can produce severe weather conditions that can temporarily reduce levels of activity.  In addition, hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore operations.  Furthermore, customer spending patterns for multiclient data, software and other oilfield services and products may result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of each year as clients seek to fully utilize their annual budgets.  Conversely, customer budget constraints may lead to lower demand for our services and products in the fourth quarter of each year.\nCustomers\nSchlumberger’s primary customers are national oil companies, large integrated oil companies and independent operators. No single customer exceeded 10% of Schlumberger’s consolidated revenue during each of 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nGovernmental Regulations\nSchlumberger is subject to numerous environmental, legal and other governmental and regulatory requirements related to its operations worldwide. For additional details, see “Item 1(a). Risk Factors—Legal and Regulatory Risks”, which is incorporated by reference in this Item 1.\nCorporate Information\nSchlumberger was founded in 1926 and is incorporated under the laws of Curaçao. Schlumberger has executive offices in Paris, Houston, London and The Hague.\nAvailable Information\nThe Schlumberger website is\nwww.slb.com\n.  Schlumberger uses its Investor Relations website,\nwww.slb.com/ir\n, as a routine channel for distribution of important information, including news releases, analyst presentations, and financial information.  Schlumberger makes available free of charge through its Investor Relations website at\nwww.slb.com/ir,\naccess to its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed on behalf of directors and executive officers, and amendments to each of those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with or furnished to the SEC.  Alternatively, you may access these reports at the SEC’s website at\nwww.sec.gov\n.  Copies are also available, without charge, from Schlumberger Investor Relations, 5599 San Felipe, 17\nth\nFloor, Houston, Texas 77056.  Unless expressly noted, the information on its website or any other website is not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this Form 10-K or any other filing Schlumberger makes with the SEC.\n8\nInformation\nA\nbout\nOur\nExecutive Officers\nThe following table sets forth, as of\nJanuary 27, 2021\n, the names and ages of the executive officers of Schlumberger, including all offices and positions held by each for the past five years.\n9"

    "text": "The following discussion of risk factors known to us contains important information for the understanding of our “forward-looking statements,” which are discussed immediately following Item 7A. of this Form 10-K and elsewhere.  These risk factors should also be read in conjunction with Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nand related notes included in this Form 10-K.\nWe urge you to consider carefully the risks described below, which discuss the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nDemand for our products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers.  The current significant oil and gas industry downturn has resulted in reduced demand for oilfield services and lower expenditures by our customers, which has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for our products and services depends substantially on expenditures by our customers for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves.  These expenditures are generally dependent on our customers’ views of future oil and natural gas prices, as well as their ability to access capital.  These expenditures are also sensitive to our customers’ views of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas.\nThe continued low oil and gas prices have also caused a reduction in cash flows for our customers, which has had a significant adverse effect on the financial condition of some of our customers.  This has resulted in, and may continue to result in, lower capital expenditures, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us.  These effects have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nHistorically, oil and natural gas prices have experienced significant volatility and can be affected by a variety of factors, including:\n10\nThe oil and gas industry has historically been extremely cyclical.  However, there can be no assurance that the demand or pricing for oil and natural gas or for our products and services will follow historic patterns or recover meaningfully in the near or medium term.\nContinued or worsening conditions in the oil and gas industry generally may have a further material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced demand for our services, and has had, and is likely to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken by businesses and governments to contain the spread of the virus, have\nresulted in a significant and swift reduction in\ninternational and US economic activity.  In our industry, geopolitical events that increased the supply of low-priced oil to the global market occurred at the same time that demand weakened due to the worldwide effects of the pandemic, leading to a collapse in oil prices in March 2020.  These events together adversely affected the demand for oil and natural gas, as well as for our services and products, and caused significant volatility and disruption\nof the\nglobal financial markets.  Other effects of the pandemic have included, and may continue to include, adverse revenue and net income effects; disruptions to our operations, including suspension or deferral of\ndrilling activities\n; customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production; downward revisions to customer budgets; limitations on access to sources of liquidity; employee impacts from illness, school closures and other community response measures; workforce reductions in response to activity declines; and temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers.  This\nperiod of extreme economic disruption, low oil prices and reduced demand for our products and services has had, and is likely to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic; and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus, including vaccine development and distribution.  COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also aggravate our other risk factors described in this Form 10-K.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from our non-US operations, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business in the more than 120 countries in which we generate revenue.\nOur non-US operations accounted for approximately 81% of our consolidated revenue in 2020, 72% in 2019 and 68% in 2018.  In addition to the risks addressed elsewhere in this section, our operations in countries other than the United States are subject to various risks, including:\n11\nSevere weather, including extreme weather conditions associated with climate change, has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nOur business has been, and in the future will be, affected by severe weather in areas where we operate, which could materially affect our operations and financial results.  Extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, flooding and landslides have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, the evacuation of personnel, stoppage of services and activity disruptions at our facilities, in our supply chain, or at well-sites.  Particularly severe weather events affecting platforms or structures may result in a suspension of activities.  In addition, impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, coastal storm surge, inland flooding from intense rainfall and hurricane-strength winds may damage our facilities.  Any such extreme weather-related events may result in increased operating costs or decreases in revenue which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur operations require us to comply with numerous laws and regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to international, regional, national, and local laws and regulations in every place where we operate, relating to matters such as environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment, import/export controls, currency exchange, bribery and corruption, data privacy and cybersecurity, intellectual property, immigration, and taxation.  These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change, and have tended to become more stringent over time.  In the event the scope of these laws and regulations expands in the future, the incremental cost of compliance could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur international operations are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws.  We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons.  Our ability to transfer people, products and data among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations.\nThe internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations.  Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery, trade control, trade sanctions or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.  Violations of international and US laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.  In addition, any major violations could have a significant effect on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business and maintain existing customer and supplier relationships.\nDemand for our products and services could be reduced by existing and future legislation, regulations and public sentiment.\nRegulatory agencies and environmental advocacy groups in the European Union, the United States and other regions or countries have been focusing considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their role in climate change.  There is also increased focus, including by governments and our customers, investors and other stakeholders, on these and other sustainability and energy transition matters.  Existing or future legislation and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, as well as initiatives by governments, non-governmental organizations, and companies to conserve energy or promote the use of alternative energy sources, and negative attitudes toward or perceptions of fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment, may significantly curtail demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for our products and services.  This may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Our business, reputation and demand for our stock could be negatively affected if we do not (or are perceived to not) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing air emissions, water discharges and waste management, as well as the importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials, chemicals and explosives.  We incur, and expect to continue to incur, significant capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations.  The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement.  These laws sometimes provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs, damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety.  Strict liability can render us liable for damages without regard to our degree of care or fault.  Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances, and, as a result, we could be liable for the actions of others.\nWe use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations.  In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes.  Accordingly, we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation\n12\nand cleanup of potentially contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as the result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances.\nIn addition, stricter enforcement or changing interpretations of existing laws and regulations, the enactment of new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nWe could be subject to substantial liability claims, including well incidents, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks.  Our operations involve production-related activities, radioactive materials, chemicals, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development and production environments.  Accidents or acts of malfeasance involving these services or equipment, or a failure of a product (including as a result of a cyberattack), could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations, which could materially adversely affect us.  Any well incidents, including blowouts at a well site, may expose us to additional liabilities, which could be material.  Generally, we rely on contractual indemnities, releases, and limitations on liability with our customers and insurance to protect us from potential liability related to such events.  However, our insurance may not protect us against liability for certain kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption.  Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate.  Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIntellectual Property and Technology Risks\nIf we are unable to maintain technology leadership, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold.\nThe oilfield services industry is highly competitive.  Our business may be adversely affected if we fail to continue to develop and produce competitive technologies in response to changes in the market, customer requirements and technology trends (including trends in favor of emissions-reducing technologies), or if we fail to deliver such technologies to our customers in a timely and cost-competitive manner in the various markets we serve.  If we are unable to maintain technology leadership in our industry, our ability to maintain market share, defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers could be adversely affected.  Furthermore, if our equipment or proprietary technologies become obsolete, the value of our intellectual property may be reduced, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLimitations on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold.\nThere can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights will be adequate.  Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending, or are trade secrets.  Our business may be adversely affected when our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected.  Patent protection on some types of technology, such as software or machine learning processes, may not be available in certain countries in which we operate.  Our competitors may also be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThird parties may claim that we have infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights.\nThe tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services and products may infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis.  Regardless of the merits, any such claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, including reputational harm, and may distract management from running our business.  Resolving such claims could increase our costs, including through royalty payments to acquire licenses, if available, from third parties and through the development of replacement technologies.  If a license to resolve a claim were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to obtain and retain skilled technical personnel could impede our operations.\nWe require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business.  Competition for the personnel required for our businesses intensifies as activity increases and technology evolves.  In periods of high utilization, it is often more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals.  This could increase our costs or have other material adverse effects on our operations.\n13\nOur operations are subject to cyber\nincidents\nthat could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are increasingly dependent on digital technologies and services to conduct our business.  We use these technologies for internal purposes, including data storage, processing and transmissions, as well as in our interactions with our business associates, such as customers and suppliers.  In addition, we develop software and other digital products and services that store, retrieve, manipulate and manage our customers’ information and data, external data, and our own data.  Our digital technologies and services, and those of our business associates, are subject to the risk of cyberattacks and, given the nature of such attacks, some incidents can remain undetected for a period of time despite efforts to detect and respond to them in a timely manner.  There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect material consequences arising from such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur.  We have experienced and will continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal conduct of our business, including attacks resulting from phishing emails and ransomware infections.  Even if we successfully defend our own digital technologies and services, we also rely on third-party business associates, with whom we may share data and services, to defend their digital technologies and services against attack.\nWe could suffer significant damage to our reputation if a cyber incident or attack were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customers’ data, other external data, or our own data, or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted, or if our digital products or services were reported to have or were perceived as having security vulnerabilities.  This could lead to fewer customers using our digital products and services, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, if our systems, or our third-party business associates’ systems, for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove to be insufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things, loss of or damage to intellectual property, proprietary or confidential information, or customer, supplier, or employee data; interruption of our business operations; increased legal and regulatory exposure and costs; and increased costs required to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity attacks.  These risks could harm our reputation and our relationships with our employees, business associates and other third parties, and may result in claims against us.  The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations."

    "text": "The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources.  Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.\n2020 Executive Overview\nGlobal demand for oil dropped precipitously from January through April of 2020, in parallel with the expansion of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, as governments around the world responded with lockdowns and travel decreased significantly.  Global stocks of crude and refined products increased as oil supply could not respond quickly enough to balance the market.\nAs a result, Brent crude oil experienced its highest price of the year—$70 per barrel—in January, with a low of $9 per barrel in mid-April.  Collaboration between OPEC and non-OPEC suppliers, including Russia, led to extraordinary supply intervention, resulting in the removal of more than eight million barrels per day (“bbl/d”) of oil supply from the markets between April and June.  This eased pressure on oil storage capacity and allowed the Brent price to stabilize in the $40 range until gaining strength in December, where it closed at $52 per barrel.\nThe OPEC-led supply alliance maintained production within an agreed quota and helped to maintain a relatively stable oil price, despite oil demand in the second half of 2020 being more than five million bbl/d lower than same period of 2019.  Demand for refined products, other than jet fuel, returned to within two million bbl/d of pre-crisis levels by end of 2020.\nOil price volatility in the first half of the year, compounded by uncertainty over the pace of COVID-19 recovery, caused producers to lay down more than 40% of the world’s drilling rigs in just six months. This suggests that $40 oil is insufficient to stimulate meaningful drilling activity growth.  However, even with massive demand reduction, the drilling activity necessary to maintain supply is still significant.\nIn the US, operators laid down nearly 70% of active rigs between the first and third quarters of 2020, before adding a modest number of rigs in the fourth quarter. As a result, US crude production fell by nearly two million bbl/d by the end of 2020.  However, the remaining rigs continued to drill in the highest quality reservoirs, which resulted in supply remaining flat over the second half of the year.\nThough global gas demand also suffered in response to the pandemic’s effect on economic activity, its use for power generation, heating, and as a chemical feedstock made it more resilient than oil demand as the pandemic spread.  Gas demand for 2020 was down only approximately 5% as compared to 2019.\nUS Henry Hub natural gas price averaged $2.03 per million British thermal units (“mmbtu”) for the year, having also fallen in the first half of 2020.  Prices recovered in the second half on decreased tight-oil associated production in line with the reduction of active rigs.  International gas hub prices were more volatile.\nAgainst this backdrop, Schlumberger’s full-year 2020 revenue of $23.6 billion declined 28% year-on-year.\nNorth American revenue fell sharply by 48% to $5.5 billion.  This decrease was largely driven by weakness in the land market as operators reacted to oversupplied markets by making deep cuts to activity.  North America operators dropped drilling and pressure pumping activity quickly in the first quarter due to the effects of the pandemic on demand, adding a modest volume of completion activity toward the end of the year. International revenue was more resilient, declining only 19% year-on-year.  This decline was most prominent in Latin America, Europe, and Africa due to downward revisions to customer budgets and COVID-19 disruptions.\nAdditionally, during the fourth quarter of 2020, Schlumberger completed two transactions: the contribution of its OneStim business in North America to Liberty Oilfield Services (“Liberty”) in exchange for a 37% stake in Liberty, and the divestiture of the North America low-flow rod-lift business in a cash transaction. These businesses accounted for approximately 25% of Schlumberger’s North America revenue in 2020.  Consequently, the percentage of Schlumberger’s revenue that it generates in the international markets will increase significantly going forward.  The combination of Schlumberger’s fit-for-basin strategy, digital technology innovation, and scale puts the company in the best position to leverage the anticipated shift of spending growth toward the international markets.\nFrom a macro perspective, oil prices have risen, buoyed by recent supply-led OPEC+ policy, the ongoing COVID-19 vaccine rollout, and multinational economic stimulus actions—driving optimism for a meaningful oil demand recovery throughout 2021.  We believe that this sets the stage for oil demand to recover to 2019 levels no later than 2023, or earlier as per recent industry analysts’ reports, reinforcing a multiyear cycle recovery as the global economy strengthens.  Absent a change to these macro assumptions, this will translate into meaningful activity increases both in North America and internationally.\nIn North America, spending and activity momentum is expected to continue in the first half of 2021 towards maintenance levels, albeit moderated by capital discipline and industry consolidation. Internationally, following the seasonal effects of the first quarter of 2021, and as OPEC+ responds to strengthening oil demand, higher spending is expected from the second quarter onwards.  Accelerated\n17\nactivity\nis not expected to\nextend beyond the short-cycle markets and will be broad, including offshore, as witnessed during the fourth quarter.\nThe quality of Schlumberger’s results in the fourth quarter of 2020 validates the progress of our performance strategy and the reinvention of Schlumberger in this new chapter for the industry.  Building from the swift execution and scale of our cost-out program, we exited the year with quarterly margins reset to 2019 levels as the upcycle begins. Leveraging our high-graded and restructured business portfolio, we see a clear path to achieve double-digit margins in North America and visible international margin improvement in 2021.  Given the depth, diversity, and executional capability of our international business, we believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit as international spending accelerates in the near- and mid-term.\nBy leveraging our new structure, Schlumberger is fully prepared to capitalize on the growth drivers of the future of our industry, particularly as we accelerate our digital growth ambition and lead in the production and recovery market.  Finally, to meet our long-term ambition to bring lower carbon and carbon-neutral energy sources and technology to market, we are visibly expanding our New Energy portfolio, to contribute to the transformation of a more resilient, sustainable, and investable energy services industry.\nFourth Quarter 2020 Results\nFourth-quarter revenue grew 5% sequentially, driven by strong activity and solid execution both in North America and in the international markets. International revenue of $4.3 billion grew 3% while North America revenue of $1.2 billion increased 13%.  Despite seasonality, revenue grew sequentially in all four Divisions for the first time since the third quarter of 2019.\nSequentially, international revenue growth outpaced rig count and was led by Latin America and by a global rebound of activity in most offshore deepwater markets. In the Middle East & Asia, growth was mostly in China, India, and Oman while Saudi Arabia remained resilient. In Europe/CIS/Africa, activity increased significantly in the offshore markets of Africa and several countries in Europe, offset by the seasonal winter slowdown in Russia. In North America, offshore activity in the US Gulf of Mexico grew, and on land, increased horizontal drilling and pressure pumping activity contributed to the higher revenue.\nDigital & Integration\nFourth-quarter revenue of $833 million, 83% of which came from the international markets, increased 13% sequentially. International revenue increased by 14% and North America revenue increased by 6% sequentially. The Digital & Integration revenue increase was primarily driven by APS projects.\n18\nDigital & Integration pretax operating margin of 32% expanded by 507 basis points (“bps”) sequentially. The margin expansion was primarily in the international markets and was largely driven by improved profitability across APS projects.\nReservoir Performance\nFourth-quarter revenue of $1.2 billion, 73% of which came from the international markets, increased 3% sequentially. International revenue declined 3% while North America revenue increased 23% sequentially. The revenue increase was primarily driven by higher OneStim activity in North America.  OneStim fourth-quarter revenue of $274 million increased 25% sequentially. This increase, however, was partially offset by seasonality in Russia and reduced activity in the Middle East & Asia.\nReservoir Performance pretax operating margin of 8% decreased 84 bps sequentially driven by seasonality in Russia, despite improved North American activity.\nWell Construction\nFourth-quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, 84% of which came from the international markets, increased 2% sequentially. International and North America revenue increased 1% and 7%, respectively. The revenue increase was due to higher activity in North America, Latin America, and the Middle East & Asia, partially offset by seasonality in Russia.\nWell Construction pretax operating margin of 10% improved by 42 bps sequentially. North America margin improved due to higher drilling activity on land while international margin was essentially flat.\nProduction Systems\nFourth-quarter revenue of $1.6 billion, 74% of which came from the international markets, increased 8% sequentially. International and North America revenue increased 7% and 11%, respectively, due to higher activity across all areas.\nProduction Systems pretax operating margin of 9% increased by 82 bps sequentially due to a higher contribution from the long-cycle business of subsea, and improved profitability in surface production systems due to cost reduction measures and higher activity.\nFull-Year 2020 Results\n19\nFull-year 2020 revenue of $\n23.6\nbillion\ndecreased 28\n%\nyear-on-year\n.\nNorth America revenue declined\n48\n%\nyear-on-year\nreflecting the continued capital discipline of North America operators, who reduced drilling and\nhydraulic\nfrac\nturing\nactivity\ndue to the pandemic\n.\nInternational revenue decreased\n19\n%\nyear-on-year,\ndue to COVID-19-related disruptions, the drop in offshore activity, and reduced customer discretionary spending.\nDigital & Integration\nFull-year 2020 revenue of $3.1 billion decreased 26% year-on-year primarily due to lower multiclient and software sales as customers reduced activity due to COVID-19 and cut discretionary spending.\nYear-on-year pretax operating margin increased 249 bps to 24% largely due to improved APS margins as a result of reduced amortization expense following the asset impairment charges that were recorded in the second quarter of 2020 and the effects of cost cutting efforts.\nReservoir Performance\nFull-year 2020 revenue of $5.6 billion decreased 40% year-on-year.  A little more than half of this revenue decrease was attributable to the sharp drop in OneStim pressure pumping activity in North America land.  The remaining portion of the revenue decline resulted from COVID-19 disruptions that caused international activity to be cancelled or suspended.\nYear-on-year pretax operating margin decreased 435 bps to 6% due to the steep revenue decline.\nWell Construction\nFull-year 2020 revenue of $8.6 billion decreased 28% year-on-year primarily due to the activity decline in US land as the rig count decreased significantly, while COVID-19 disruptions caused drilling activities to be cancelled or suspended in several international markets.\nYear-on-year pretax operating margin only decreased 196 bps to 10% as the effects of the revenue decline were partially mitigated by prompt cost cutting measures.\nProduction Systems\nFull-year 2020 revenue of $6.7 billion decreased 19% year-on-year primarily driven by lower sales of valves and surface systems in North America.\nYear-on-year pretax operating margin decreased 101 bps to 9% due to the revenue decline.\nFull-Year 2019 Results\n20\nFull-year 2019 revenue of $32.9 billion was essentially flat year-on-year with North America revenue decreasing 11% and international revenue increasing 7%.  The international results were underpinned by increased investment levels.  In contrast, the North America result reflected a slowing production growth rate on land as operators maintained capital discipline and reduced drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity.\nDigital & Integration\nFull-year 2019 revenue of $4.1 billion increased 9% year-on-year primarily driven by increased APS activity.\nYear-on-year pretax operating margin decreased 181 bps to 21% primarily as a result of a less favorable revenue mix.\nReservoir Performance\nFull-year 2019 revenue of $9.3 billion decreased 7% year-on-year primarily driven by lower OneStim activity in North America as customers reduced spending due to higher cost of capital, lower borrowing capacity and expectations of better return from their shareholders.\nYear-on-year pretax operating margin decreased 97 bps to 11% primarily due to reduced profitability in OneStim in North America.\nWell Construction\nFull-year 2019 revenue of $11.9 billion increased 5% year-on-year primarily due to higher demand for drilling services, largely in the international markets.\nYear-on-year pretax operating margin decreased 93 bps to 12% despite higher revenue as margins were affected by competitive pricing and higher costs associated with a number of integrated drilling contracts internationally.\nProduction Systems\nFull-year 2019 revenue of $8.2 billion was essentially flat year-on-year as lower revenue for OneSubsea and valves and process systems was offset by higher surface system and completion sales.\nYear-on-year pretax operating margin was essentially unchanged at 10.4%.\nInterest and Other Income\nInterest & other income\nconsisted of the following:\nThe increase in earnings of equity method investments in 2020 as compared to 2019 is primarily related to higher income associated with Schlumberger’s equity investments in rig- and seismic-related businesses, while the decrease in 2019 as compared to 2018 was primarily related to lower income from those same businesses.\nThe decrease in interest income in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily attributable to lower cash and short-term investment balances.\n21\nThe unrealized gain on marketable securities in 2020 relates to an investment in a\nstart-up company that Schlumberger previously invested in that\ncompleted an initial public offering during the fourth quarter of 2020\n.\nAs a result, Schlumberger recognized an unrealized gain of $39 million to increase the carrying value of\nthis investment to its fair value of\n$43 million as of December 31, 2020\n.  See Note 3 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $563 million in 2020 decreased $46 million compared to 2019.  This decrease was primarily due to certain debt being refinanced with lower interest rate debt.  Interest expense of $609 million in 2019 increased $34 million compared to 2018.  This increase is primarily due to an increase in the weighted average debt balance during 2019 as compared to 2018.\nOther\nResearch & engineering\nand\nGeneral & administrative\nexpenses, as a percentage of\nRevenue\n, were as follows:\nIncome Taxes\nThe Schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings.  When the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America increases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate generally decreases.  Conversely, when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America decreases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate generally increases.\nThe Schlumberger effective tax rate was 7% in 2020 as compared to 3% in 2019.  The charges and credits described in Note 3 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n, reduced the effective tax rate by approximately 12 and 13 points in 2020 and 2019, respectively, as a significant portion of these charges were not tax effective.  Changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings accounted for the remaining increase in the effective tax rate in 2020 as compared to 2019.\nThe Schlumberger effective tax rate was 3% in 2019 as compared to 17% in 2018.  The lower effective tax rate was almost entirely due to the 2019 charges and credits described in Note 3 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n, which primarily related to non-deductible goodwill.\n22\nCharges and Credits\nSchlumberger recorded significant charges and credits during 2020, 2019 and 2018.  These charges and credits, which are summarized below, are more fully described in Note 3 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.\nThe following is a summary of the 2020 charges and credits.\nAs a result of the first quarter 2020 impairment charges, commencing with the second quarter of 2020, depreciation and amortization expense was reduced by approximately $95 million on a quarterly basis.  Approximately $33 million of this quarterly reduction is reflected in the Digital & Integration Division and $12 million is reflected in the Reservoir Performance Division.  The remaining $50 million is reflected in the “Corporate & other” line item.\nAs a result of the second quarter 2020 restructuring and impairment charges, commencing with the third quarter of 2020, depreciation and amortization expense was reduced by approximately $80 million and lease expense was reduced by $25 million on a quarterly basis.  Approximately $51 million of this quarterly reduction is reflected in the Digital & Integration Division and $31 million is reflected in the Reservoir Performance Division, with the remaining $23 million reflected among the Well Construction Division and Production Systems Division.\nAs a result of the third quarter 2020 restructuring charges, commencing with the fourth quarter of 2020, depreciation and lease expense was reduced by $15 million on a quarterly basis.  This quarterly reduction is reflected among all of the Divisions.\n23\nThe following is a summary of the 2019 charges and credits\n.\nA significant portion of the third-quarter impairment charges were recorded effective August 31, 2019.  Accordingly, the 2019 results reflect a $108 million reduction in depreciation and amortization expense for the last four months of 2019.  Approximately $64 million of this amount is reflected in the Reservoir Performance Division and $20 million is reflected in the Production Systems Division.  The remaining $24 million is reflected in the “Corporate & other” line item.\nThe following is a summary of the 2018 charges and credits.  The $215 million gain on the sale of the marine seismic acquisition business is classified in\nGains on sale of businesses\nin the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\n, while the $356 million of charges are classified in\nImpairments & other\n.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe\neffects of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a significant and swift reduction in international and US economic activity.  These effects have adversely affected the demand for oil and natural gas, as well as for Schlumberger’s products and services, and\ncaused significant volatility and disruption of the financial markets.  This period of extreme economic disruption, low oil prices and reduced demand for Schlumberger’s products and services has had, and is likely to continue to have, a material adverse impact on Schlumberger’s business, results of operations, financial condition and, at times, access to sources of liquidity.\nIn view of the uncertainty of the depth and extent of the contraction in oil demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic combined with the weaker commodity price environment, Schlumberger turned its strategic focus to cash conservation and protecting its balance sheet.  As a result, in April 2020 Schlumberger announced a 75% reduction to its quarterly cash dividend.  The revised dividend supports Schlumberger’s value proposition through a balanced approach of shareholder distributions and organic investment, while providing flexibility to address the uncertain environment.  This decision reflects the Company’s focus on its capital stewardship program as well as its commitment to maintain both a strong liquidity position and a strong investment grade credit rating that provides privileged access to the financial markets.\n24\nDetails of the components of liquidity as well as changes in liquidity follow:\n25\nKey liquidity events during 2020, 2019 and 2018 included:\nThe following table summarizes the activity under this share repurchase program during 2020, 2019 and 2018:\n26\nSchlumberger expects to receive an income tax refund of approximately $0.5 billion in 2021.  This receivable is included in\nOther current assets\nin the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nas of December 31, 2020.\nSchlumberger has a provision of $0.5 billion relating to severance recorded in its\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nas of December 31, 2020.  The majority of this balance is expected to be paid during the first half of 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Schlumberger had $3.0 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand.  Schlumberger had committed credit facility agreements with commercial banks aggregating $6.3 billion that support commercial paper programs, of which $5.9 billion was available and unused as of December 31, 2020.  Schlumberger also has a €1.54 billion committed revolving credit facility that expires in the second quarter of 2021 but can be extended at Schlumberger’s option for up to an additional year.  At December 31, 2020, no amounts have been drawn under this facility.  Schlumberger believes these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nThe total outstanding commercial paper borrowings were $0.4 billion as of December 31, 2020 and $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2019.\nSummary of Contractual Obligations\nRefer to Note 17,\nPension and Other Benefit Plans,\nof the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nfor details regarding Schlumberger’s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.\n27\nAs discussed in Note\n13\n,\nIncome Taxes\n,\nof the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n, included in the Schlumberger\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nat December 31,\n2020\nis approximately $\n1.3\nbillion of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over 100\ntax\njurisdictions in which Schlumberger conducts business.\nDue to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded, Schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities.\nSchlumberger has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees that relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc.  These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where Schlumberger operates.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires Schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses.  The following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by Schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nSchlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nSchlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value.  Judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve.  Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices.  Adjustments to the allowance may be required in future periods depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of Schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments.\nAs a large multinational company with a long history of operating in a cyclical industry, Schlumberger has extensive experience in working with its customers during difficult times to manage its accounts receivable.  During weak economic environments or when there is an extended period of weakness in oil and gas prices, Schlumberger typically experiences delays in the payment of its receivables.  However, except for a $469 million accounts receivable write-off during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the political and economic condition in Venezuela, Schlumberger has not had material write-offs due to uncollectible accounts receivable over the recent industry downturn.  Schlumberger generates revenue in more than 120 countries.  As of December 31, 2020, only five of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5% of Schlumberger’s net accounts receivable balance, of which only one (Mexico) accounted for greater than 10% of such receivables.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\nSchlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill.  The goodwill relating to each of Schlumberger’s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event, or change in circumstances, indicates an impairment may have occurred.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, Schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount.  If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, Schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, there is no need to perform any further testing.  However, if Schlumberger concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded based on that difference.\nSchlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test.\nDuring 2020 and 2019, Schlumberger recorded goodwill impairment charges of $3.1 billion and $8.8 billion, respectively.  Refer to Note 3 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nfor details regarding the facts and circumstances that led to this impairment and how the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated, including the significant assumptions used and other details.\nLong-lived assets, including fixed assets, intangible assets and investments in APS projects, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual\n28\ndisposition.\nIf such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value.\nThe determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management.\nIf there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future.\nIncome Taxes\nSchlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions, a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving.  Schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities.  These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts.  Schlumberger recognizes the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position.  Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes that will be due upon the conclusion of these audits.  Estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances.  However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities that could be materially different from these estimates.  In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs.\nRevenue Recognition for Certain Long-term Construction-type Contracts\nSchlumberger recognizes revenue for certain long-term construction-type contracts over time.  These contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customer-specific applications.  Under this method, revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract.  Progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs.  Approximately 5% of Schlumberger’s revenue in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was recognized under this method.\nThe estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project.  Revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims.  Profits are recognized based on the estimated project profit multiplied by the percentage complete.  Due to the nature of these projects, adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs are often required as work progresses.  Any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they become probable.\nMulticlient Seismic Data\nSchlumberger capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data.  The carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $317 million and $568 million, respectively.  Such costs are charged to\nCost of services\nbased on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data.  However, an individual survey generally will not carry a net book value greater than a 4-year, straight-line amortized value.\nThe carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred.  Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues, which involve significant judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys.  Significant adverse changes in Schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period.  For purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library, surveys are primarily analyzed for impairment on a survey-by-survey basis.\n29\nPension and Postretirement Benefits\nSchlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in Note 17 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.  The obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates.  These assumptions are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis, or upon the occurrence of significant events.\nThe discount rate that Schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of payment of the related benefit obligations.  The following summarizes the discount rates utilized by Schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans:\nThe expected rate of return for Schlumberger’s retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid, with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class.  The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the United States pension plans was 6.60% in both 2020 and 2019.  The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international pension plans was 6.71% in 2020 and 7.22% in 2019.  A lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense.\nSchlumberger’s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends.  The overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine the 2020 postretirement medical expense and the postretirement medical liability at December 31, 2020 was 7.25%, graded to 4.5% over the next eleven years.\nThe following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for Schlumberger’s United States and international pension plans:\nThe following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions, holding all other assumptions constant, for Schlumberger’s United States postretirement medical plans:\n30"

    "text": "Schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nAs a multinational company, Schlumberger generates revenue in more than 120 countries.  Schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the US dollar.  Approximately 73% of Schlumberger’s revenue in 2020 was denominated in US dollars.  However, outside the United States, a significant portion of Schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies.  Therefore, when the US dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which Schlumberger conducts business, the US dollar-reported expenses will increase.\nSchlumberger maintains a foreign-currency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on its earnings.  Schlumberger enters into foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against currency fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities, and certain expenses denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.\nA 10% appreciation in the US dollar from the December 31, 2020 market rates would increase the unrealized value of Schlumberger’s forward contracts by $2 million.  Conversely, a 10% depreciation in the US dollar from the December 31, 2020 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of Schlumberger’s forward contracts by $5 million.  In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future earnings.\nAt December 31, 2020, contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $8.6 billion in various foreign currencies, of which $6.4 billion related to hedges of debt balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.\nSchlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio.  Schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and occasionally interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates.  At December 31, 2020, Schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately $16.3 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately $0.6 billion.\nSchlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio.\nShort-term investments,\nwhich totaled approximately $2.2 billion at December 31, 2020, are comprised primarily of money market funds, time deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, bonds and notes, substantially all of which are denominated in US dollars.  The average return on investments was 1.5% in 2020.\n31\nThe following table\nreflects\nthe\ncarrying amounts of Schlumberger’s debt at December 31,\n20\n20\nby year of maturity:\nThe fair value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately $17.6 billion as of December 31, 2020.  The weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of December 31, 2020 was 1.0%.\nSchlumberger does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.\n32\nForward-looking Statements\nThis Form 10-K, as well as other statements we make, contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which include any statements that are not historical facts, such as our forecasts or expectations regarding business outlook; growth for Schlumberger as a whole and for each of its Divisions (and for specified business lines or geographic areas within each Division); oil and natural gas demand and production growth; oil and natural gas prices; pricing; Schlumberger’s response to, and preparedness for, the COVID-19 pandemic and other widespread health emergencies; improvements in operating procedures and technology; capital expenditures by Schlumberger and the oil and gas industry; the business strategies of Schlumberger, including digital and “fit for basin,” as well as the strategies of Schlumberger’s customers; Schlumberger’s restructuring efforts and charges recorded as a result of such efforts; access to raw materials; Schlumberger’s effective tax rate; Schlumberger’s APS projects, joint ventures, and other alliances; future global economic and geopolitical conditions; future liquidity; and future results of operations, such as margin levels.

revenue recognized for certain long-term construction-type contracts over time; recoverability of fixed assets, goodwill, intangible assets, Asset Performance Solutions investments and investments in affiliates; income taxes; multiclient seismic data; contingencies and actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans.  Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nSchlumberger adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\non January 1, 2018.  This ASU amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition and requires companies to recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration\na company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.  Under the transition method selected by Schlumberger, this ASU was applied only to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018.  Prior period amounts were not adjusted and were reflected in accordance with Schlumberger’s historical accounting.  The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on Schlumberger’s\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.\nSchlumberger recognizes revenue upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for these products or services.  The vast majority of Schlumberger’s services and product offerings are short-term in nature.  The time between invoicing and when payment is due under these arrangements is generally between\n30\nto\n60\ndays\n.\nRevenue is occasionally generated from contractual arrangements that include multiple performance obligations.  Revenue from these arrangements is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.  Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using expected costs plus margin.\nRevenue is recognized for certain long-term construction-type contracts over time.  These contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customer-specific applications.  Revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract.  Progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs.  The estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project.  Revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims.  Due to the nature of these projects, adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs may be required as work progresses.  Progress billings are generally issued upon completion of certain phases of work as stipulated in the contract.  Any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they become probable.\nDue to the nature of its businesses, Schlumberger does not have significant backlog.  Total backlog was $\n2.6\nbillion at December 31, 2020, of which approximately\n60\n% is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2021.\n40\nShort-term Investments\nShort-term investments\nare comprised primarily of money market funds, time deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, bonds and notes, substantially all of which are denominated in US dollars and are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.\nFor purposes of the\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n, Schlumberger does not consider\nShort-term investments\nto be cash equivalents.\nInvestments in Affiliated Companies\nInvestments in companies in which Schlumberger does not have a controlling financial interest, but over which it has significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method.  Schlumberger’s share of the after-tax earnings of equity method investees is included in\nInterest and other income\n.  Investments in privately held companies in which Schlumberger does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the cost method.  Investments in publicly traded companies in which Schlumberger does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of\nInterest and other income\n.\nMulticlient Seismic Data\nSchlumberger’s multiclient library consists of completed and in-process seismic surveys that are licensed on a nonexclusive basis.  Schlumberger capitalizes costs directly incurred in acquiring and processing the multiclient seismic data.  Such costs are charged to\nCost of services\nbased on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data.  However, an individual survey generally will not carry a net book value greater than a 4-year, straight-line amortized value.\nThe carrying value of the multiclient library is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicating impairment may have occurred.  Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future cash flows, which involve significant judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys.  Significant adverse changes in Schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period.\nAsset Performance Solutions\nAsset Performance Solutions (“APS”) projects are focused on developing and co-managing production of customers’ assets under long-term agreements.  Schlumberger invests its own services and products, and in certain historical cases, cash into the field development activities and operations.  Although in certain arrangements Schlumberger is paid for a portion of the services or products it provides, generally Schlumberger will not be paid at the time of providing its services or upon delivery of its products.  Instead, Schlumberger is generally compensated based on cash flow generated or on a fee-per-barrel basis.  This includes certain arrangements whereby Schlumberger is only compensated based on incremental production it helps deliver above a mutually agreed baseline.\nSchlumberger capitalizes its cash investments in a project as well as the direct costs associated with providing services or products for which Schlumberger will be compensated when the related production is achieved.  These capitalized investments are amortized to the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\nas the related production is achieved based on the units of production method, whereby each unit produced is assigned a pro-rata portion of the unamortized costs based on estimated total production, resulting in a matching of revenue with the applicable costs.  Amortization expense relating to these capitalized investments was $\n396\nmillion, $\n731\nmillion and $\n568\nmillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe unamortized portion of Schlumberger’s investments in APS projects was $\n1.713\nbillion and $\n3.724\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  These amounts are included within\nOther Assets\nin Schlumberger’s\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\n41\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nSchlumberger’s assets that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, short-term investments, receivables from clients and derivative financial instruments.  Schlumberger places its cash and short-term investments with financial institutions and corporations and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one of them.  Schlumberger regularly evaluates the creditworthiness of the issuers in which it invests.  By using derivative financial instruments to hedge certain exposures, Schlumberger exposes itself to some credit risk.  Schlumberger minimizes this credit risk by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties, limiting the exposure to each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of its counterparties.\nSchlumberger generates revenue in more than\n120\ncountries and as such, its accounts receivable are spread over many countries and customers.  Mexico represented approximately\n14\n% of Schlumberger’s net accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2020.\nNo\nother country accounted for greater than 10% of Schlumberger’s accounts receivable balance.  Schlumberger maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based on expected collectability and performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition.  If the financial condition of Schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, adjustments to the allowance may be required.\nEarnings per Share\nThe following is a reconciliation from basic to diluted earnings (loss) per share of Schlumberger for each of the last three years:\nThe number of outstanding employee stock options to purchase shares of Schlumberger common stock and unvested restricted stock units that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings/loss per share, because to do so would have had an anti-dilutive effect, were as follows:\nReclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\n42\n3.\nCharges and Credits\n2020\nSchlumberger recorded the following charges and credits during 2020, all of which, unless otherwise noted, are classified in\nImpairments & other\nin the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\n:\nFirst quarter 2020:\nSchlumberger had\n11\nreporting units with goodwill balances aggregating $\n16.0\nbillion.  Schlumberger determined that the fair value of\nfour\nof its reporting units, representing $\n4.5\nbillion of goodwill, was substantially in excess of their carrying value.  Schlumberger performed a detailed quantitative impairment assessment of the remaining\nseven\nreporting units, which represented $\n11.5\nbillion of goodwill.  As a result of this assessment, Schlumberger concluded that the goodwill associated with each of these seven reporting units was impaired, resulting in a $\n3.1\nbillion goodwill impairment charge.\n43\nFollowing the $3.1 billion goodwill impairment charge relating to these seven reporting units,\nsix\nof these reporting units had a remaining goodwill balance.  These goodwill balances ranged between $\n0.2\nbillion and $\n5.0\nbillion and aggregated to $\n8.4\nbillion as of March 31, 2020.\nSchlumberger used the income approach to estimate the fair value of its reporting units, but also considered the market approach to validate the results.  The income approach estimates the fair value by discounting each reporting unit’s estimated future cash flows using Schlumberger’s estimate of the discount rate, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date.  The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate the discounted cash flow results.  The market approach involves significant judgement involved in the selection of the appropriate peer group companies and valuation multiples.\nSome of the more significant assumptions inherent in the income approach include the estimated future net annual cash flows for each reporting unit and the discount rate.  Schlumberger selected the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow projections using historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and estimated growth rates.  Schlumberger’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable.  However, given the inherent uncertainty in determining the assumptions underlying a discounted cash flow analysis, particularly in a volatile market, actual results may differ from those used in Schlumberger’s valuations which could result in additional impairment charges in the future.\nThe discount rates utilized to value Schlumberger’s reporting units were between\n12.0\n% and\n13.5\n%, depending on the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting unit as well as the size of the reporting unit.  Assuming all other assumptions and inputs used in each of the respective discounted cash flow analysis were held constant, a\n50\n-basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate assumptions would have changed the fair value of the\nseven\nreporting units, on average, by less than\n5\n%.\nSecond quarter 2020:\n44\nThe fair value of the impaired intangible assets, fixed assets, APS investments, right-of-use assets and multiclient seismic data was estimated based on the present value of projected future cash flows that the underlying assets are expected to generate.  Such estimates included unobservable inputs that required significant judgement.\nThird quarter 2020:\nFourth quarter 2020:\nSchlumberger will account for its investment in Liberty under the equity method of accounting and will record its share of Liberty’s net income on a one-quarter lag.  Based on the quoted market price of Liberty’s shares as of December 31, 2020, the value of Schlumberger’s investment is approximately $\n0.7\nbillion.\nAs market conditions evolve and Schlumberger continues to develop its strategy to deal with such conditions, it may result in further restructuring and/or impairment charges in future periods.\n45\n2019\nSchlumberger recorded the following charges and credits during 2019, all of which are classified as\nImpairments & other\nin the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\n, except for the gain on the formation of the Sensia joint venture:\nThird quarter of 2019:\nAs a result of these facts, Schlumberger determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of certain of its reporting units was less than their carrying value.  Therefore, Schlumberger performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of August 31, 2019.\nAs of August 31, 2019, Schlumberger had\n17\nreporting units with goodwill balances aggregating $\n25.0\nbillion.  Schlumberger determined that the fair value of\nseven\nof its reporting units, representing approximately $\n13.8\nbillion of the goodwill, was substantially in excess of their carrying value.  Schlumberger performed a detailed quantitative impairment assessment of the remaining\n10\nreporting units, which represented $\n11.2\nbillion of goodwill.  As a result of this assessment, Schlumberger concluded that the goodwill associated with\nnine\nof the 10 reporting units was impaired, resulting in an $\n8.8\nbillion goodwill impairment charge.\nSchlumberger primarily used the income approach to estimate the fair value of its reporting units, but also considered the market approach to validate the results.  The income approach estimates the fair value by discounting each reporting unit’s estimated future cash flows using Schlumberger’s estimate of the discount rate, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date.  The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate the discounted cash flow results.  The market approach involves significant judgement involved in the selection of the appropriate peer group companies and valuation multiples.\nSome of the more significant assumptions inherent in the income approach include the estimated future net annual cash flows for each reporting unit and the discount rate.  Schlumberger selected the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow projections using historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and estimated growth rates.  Schlumberger’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable.\n46\nThe discount rates utilized to value Schlumberger’s reporting units were between\n12.5\n% and\n14.0\n%, depending on the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting unit.  Assuming all other assumptions and inputs used in each of the respective discounted cash flow analysis were held constant, a\n50\nbasis point increase in the discount rate assumption would have increased the goodwill impairment charge by approximately $\n0.3\nbillion.  Conversely, assuming all other assumptions and inputs used in each of the respective discounted cash flow analysis were held constant, a\n50\nbasis point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the goodwill impairment charge by approximately $\n0.4\nbillion.\nRecoverability testing, which was performed as of August 31, 2019, indicated that long-lived assets associated with certain asset groups were impaired.  The estimated fair value of these asset groups was determined to be below their carrying value.  As a result, Schlumberger recorded the following impairment and related charges:\nThe fair value of certain of the assets impaired during the fourth quarter of 2019 was estimated based on the present value of projected future cash flows that the underlying assets are expected to generate.  Such estimates included unobservable inputs that required significant judgment.\nFourth quarter of 2019:\n47\n2018\nDuring 2018, Schlumberger recorded the following charges and credits:\n4.\nInventories\nInventories, which are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value, consist of the following:\n48\n5.\nFixed Assets\nFixed assets consist of the following:\nThe estimated useful lives of Buildings & improvements are primarily\n25\nto\n30\nyears\n.  The estimated useful lives of Machinery & equipment are primarily\n5\nto\n10\nyears\n.\nDepreciation expense, which is recorded on a straight-line basis, was $\n1.6\nbillion, $\n2.0\nbillion and $\n2.1\nbillion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n6.\nMulticlient Seismic Data\nThe change in the carrying amount of multiclient seismic data is as follows:\n7.\nGoodwill\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment were as follows:\n49\nIn connection with the change in reportable segments discussed in Note 16 –\nSegment Information\n, Schlumberger reallocated goodwill that existed as of September 30, 2020 to the new reporting units on a relative fair value basis as follows:\n8.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of the following:\nCustomer relationships are generally amortized over periods ranging from\n18\nto\n28\nyears\n, technology/technical know-how are generally amortized over periods ranging from\n10\nto\n18\nyears\n, and tradenames are generally amortized over periods ranging from\n15\nto\n30\nyears\n.\nAmortization expense was $\n371\nmillion in 2020, $\n618\nmillion in 2019 and $\n673\nmillion in 2018.\nBased on the carrying value of intangible assets at December 31, 2020, amortization expense for the subsequent five years is estimated to be as follows: 2021: $\n307\nmillion, 2022: $\n304\nmillion, 2023: $\n293\nmillion, 2024: $\n269\nmillion and 2025: $\n259\nmillion.\n50\n9.\nLong-term Debt and Debt Facility Agreements\nLong-term Debt\nconsists of the following:\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, Schlumberger issued $\n500\nmillion of\n1.40\n% Senior Notes due\n2025\nand $\n350\nmillion of\n2.65\n% Senior Notes due\n2030\n.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, Schlumberger issued €\n1.0\nbillion of\n1.375\n% Guaranteed Notes due\n2026\n, $\n900\nmillion of\n2.65\n% Senior Notes due\n2030\nand €\n1.0\nbillion of\n2.00\n% Guaranteed Notes due\n2032\n.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, Schlumberger repurchased all $\n600\nmillion of its\n4.20\n% Senior Notes due\n2021\nand $\n935\nmillion of its\n3.30\n% Senior Notes due\n2021\n.  Schlumberger paid a premium of approximately $\n40\nmillion in connection with these repurchases.  This premium was classified in\nImpairments & other\nin the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\n.  (See Note 3 –\nCharges and Credits\n.)\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, Schlumberger established a €\n5.0\nbillion Guaranteed Euro Medium Term Note program that provides for the issuance of various types of debt instruments such as fixed or floating rate notes in euro, US dollar or other currencies.  At December 31, 2020, Schlumberger had not issued any debt under this program.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, Schlumberger issued €\n400\nmillion of\n0.25\n% Notes due\n2027\nand €\n400\nmillion of\n0.50\n% Notes due\n2031\n.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, Schlumberger repurchased the remaining $\n416\nmillion of its\n3.00\n% Senior Notes due\n2020\n; $\n126\nmillion of its\n4.50\n% Senior Notes due\n2021\n; $\n500\nmillion of its\n4.20\n% Senior Notes due\n2021\n; and $\n106\nmillion of its\n3.60\n% Senior Notes due\n2022\n.\nSchlumberger paid a premium of $\n28\nmillion in connection with these repurchases.  This premium, net of related credits, was classified as\nImpairments & other\nin the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\n.  (See Note 3 -\nCharges and Credits\n.)\n51\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, Schlumberger issued €\n500\nmillion of\n0.00\n% Notes due\n2024\n, €\n500\nmillion of\n0.25\n% Notes due\n2027\nand €\n500\nmillion of\n0.50\n% Notes due\n2031\n.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, Schlumberger repurchased $\n783\nmillion of its\n3.00\n% Senior Notes due\n2020\nand $\n321\nmillion of its\n3.625\n% Senior Notes due\n2022\n.  Schlumberger paid a premium of $\n29\nmillion in connection with these repurchases.  This premium was classified as\nImpairments & other\nin the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\n.  (See Note 3 -\nCharges and Credits.\n)\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, Schlumberger completed a debt exchange offer, pursuant to which it issued $\n1.500\nbillion in principal of\n3.90\n% Senior Notes due\n2028\n(the “New Notes”) in exchange for $\n401\nmillion of\n3.00\n% Senior Notes due\n2020\n, $\n234\nmillion of\n3.63\n% Senior Notes due\n2022\nand $\n817\nmillion of\n4.00\n% Senior Notes due\n2025\n.  In connection with the exchange of principal, Schlumberger paid a premium of $\n48\nmillion, substantially all of which was in the form of New Notes.  This premium is being amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the New Notes.\nDuring the first quarter of 2019 Schlumberger issued $\n750\nmillion of\n3.75\n% Senior Notes due\n2024\nand $\n850\nmillion of\n4.30\n% Senior Notes due\n2029\n.\nAt December 31, 2020, Schlumberger had committed credit facility agreements with commercial banks aggregating $\n6.25\nbillion, of which $\n5.86\nbillion was available and unused.  These committed facilities support commercial paper programs in the United States and Europe, of which\n$\n2.75\nbillion matures in February 2023, $\n2.0\nbillion matures in February 2025 and $\n1.5\nbillion matures in July 2025.  Schlumberger also has a €\n1.54\nbillion committed revolving credit facility that expires in the second quarter of 2021 but can be extended at Schlumberger’s option for up to an additional year.  At December 31, 2020, no amounts had been drawn under this facility. Interest rates and other terms of borrowing under these lines of credit vary by facility.\nCommercial paper borrowings are classified as long-term debt to the extent they are backed up by available and unused committed credit facilities maturing in more than one year and to the extent it is Schlumberger’s intent to maintain these obligations for longer than one year.  Borrowings under the commercial paper programs at December 31, 2020 were $\n0.4\nbillion, all of which was classified in\nLong-term debt\nin the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n.  At December 31, 2019, borrowings under the commercial paper programs were $\n2.2\nbillion, all of which was classified in\nLong-term debt\nin the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n.\nThe weighted average interest rate on variable rate debt as of December 31, 2020 was\n1.0\n%.\nLong-term Debt\nas of December 31, 2020 is due as follows:\n$\n1.9\nbillion in 2022, $\n1.9\nbillion in 2023, $\n1.4\nbillion in 2024, $\n1.5\nbillion in 2025, $\n2.0\nbillion in 2026, $\n1.1\nbillion in 2027 and $\n6.3\nbillion thereafter.\nThe fair value of Schlumberger’s\nLong-term Debt\nat December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was $\n17.3\nbillion and $\n15.3\nbillion, respectively, and was estimated based on quoted market prices.\nSchlumberger Limited fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by certain of its subsidiaries, including securities issued by Schlumberger Investment SA and Schlumberger Finance Canada Ltd., both wholly-owned subsidiaries of Schlumberger Limited.\n10.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nAs a multinational company, Schlumberger conducts its business in over\n120\ncountries.  Schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the US dollar.  Approximately\n73\n% of Schlumberger’s revenues in 2020 were denominated in US dollars.  However, outside the United States, a significant portion of Schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies.  Therefore, when the US dollar weakens (strengthens) in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which Schlumberger conducts business, the US dollar–reported expenses will increase (decrease).\nSchlumberger is exposed to risks on future cash flows to the extent that the local currency is not the functional currency and expenses denominated in local currency are not equal to revenues denominated in local currency.  Schlumberger uses foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against a portion of these cash flow risks.  These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, with the changes in the fair value of the hedge recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nand in\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss.\nAmounts recorded in\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nare reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged item is recognized in earnings.\n52\nSchlumberger is also exposed to risks on future cash flows relating to certain of its fixed rate debt denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  Schlumberger uses cross-currency swaps to provide a hedge against these cash flow risks.  Included in\nOther Assets\nwas $\n427\nmillion at December 31, 2020 ($\n41\nmillion at December 31, 2019) and included in\nOther Liabilities\nwas $\n13\nmillion at December 31, 2020 ($\n38\nmillion at December 31, 2019) relating to the fair value of outstanding cross-currency swap derivatives.  The fair value was determined using a model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived or collaborated by observable data.\nDuring 2019, a US-dollar functional currency subsidiary of Schlumberger issued €\n1.5\nbillion of Euro-denominated debt.  Schlumberger entered into cross-currency swaps for an aggregate notional amount of €\n1.5\nbillion in order to hedge changes in the fair value of its €\n0.5\nbillion\n0.00\n% Notes due 2024, €\n0.5\nbillion\n0.25\n% Notes due 2027 and €\n0.5\nbillion\n0.50\n% Notes due 2031.  These cross-currency swaps effectively convert the Euro-denominated notes to US-dollar denominated debt with fixed annual interest rates of\n2.29\n%,\n2.51\n% and\n2.76\n%, respectively.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, a US-dollar functional currency subsidiary of Schlumberger issued €\n0.8\nbillion of Euro-denominated debt.  Schlumberger entered into cross-currency swaps for an aggregate notional amount of €\n0.8\nbillion in order to hedge changes in the fair value of its €\n0.4\nbillion of\n0.25\n% Notes due 2027 and €\n0.4\nbillion of\n0.50\n% Notes due 2031.  These cross-currency swaps effectively convert the Euro-denominated notes to US-dollar denominated debt with fixed annual interest rates of\n1.87\n% and\n2.20\n%, respectively.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, a US-dollar functional currency subsidiary of Schlumberger issued €\n2.0\nbillion of Euro-denominated debt.  Schlumberger entered into cross-currency swaps for an aggregate notional amount of €\n2.0\nbillion in order to hedge changes in the fair value of its €\n1.0\nbillion of\n1.375\n% Guaranteed Notes due 2026 and €\n1.0\nbillion of\n2.00\n% Guaranteed Notes due 2032.  These cross-currency swaps effectively convert the swapped portion of the Euro-denominated notes to US-dollar denominated debt with fixed annual interest rates of\n2.77\n% and\n3.49\n%, respectively.\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, a Canadian dollar functional currency subsidiary of Schlumberger issued $\n0.5\nbillion of US dollar denominated debt.  Schlumberger entered into cross-currency swaps for an aggregate notional amount of $\n0.5\nbillion in order to hedge changes in the fair value of its $\n0.5\nbillion\n1.40\n% Senior Notes due 2025.  These cross-currency swaps effectively convert the US dollar notes to Canadian dollar denominated debt with a fixed annual interest rate of\n1.73\n%.\nSchlumberger is exposed to changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  While Schlumberger uses foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge this exposure as it relates to certain currencies, these contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.  Instead, the fair value of the contracts is recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nand changes in the fair value are recognized in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss),\nas are changes in the fair value of the hedged item.  Transaction losses of $\n21\nmillion in 2020 and transaction gains of $\n2\nmillion in 2019 and $\n1\nmillion in 2018 were recognized in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\nnet of related hedging activities.\nAt December 31, 2020, contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $\n8.6\nbillion in various foreign currencies, of which $\n6.4\nbillion relates to hedges of debt denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.\nOther than the previously mentioned cross-currency swaps, the fair value of the other outstanding derivatives was\nno\nt material at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe effect of derivative instruments designated as hedges and those not designated as hedges on the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\nwas as follows:\n53\nSchlumberger does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.\n11.\nStockholders’ Equity\nSchlumberger is authorized to issue\n4,500,000,000\nshares of common stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share, of which\n1,392,325,960\nand\n1,384,515,345\nshares were outstanding on December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of stock held.  Schlumberger is also authorized to issue\n200,000,000\nshares of preferred stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share, which may be issued in series with terms and conditions determined by the Schlumberger Board of Directors.\nNo\nshares of preferred stock have been issued.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nconsists of the following:\nOther comprehensive loss was $\n447\nmillion in 2020 and $\n239\nmillion in 2018.  Other comprehensive income was $\n184\nmillion in 2019.\n12.\nStock-based Compensation Plans\nSchlumberger has three types of stock-based compensation programs: (i) stock options, (ii) a restricted stock, restricted stock unit and performance share unit program (collectively referred to as “restricted stock”), and (iii) a discounted stock purchase plan (“DSPP”).\nStock Options\nKey employees may be granted stock options under Schlumberger stock option plans.  The exercise price equals the average of the high and low sales prices of Schlumberger stock on the date of grant.  The maximum term is\n10\nyears, and the options generally vest in increments\nover five years\n.\n54\nThe fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions and resulting weighted-average fair value per share:\nThe following table summarizes information related to options outstanding and options exercisable as of December 31, 2020:\nThe weighted-average remaining contractual life of stock options exercisable as of December 31, 2020 was\n3.3\nyears.\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nStock options outstanding and stock options exercisable as of December 31, 2020 had\nno\nintrinsic value.\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was\n$\n4\nmillion and $\n15\nmillion, respectively.  There were\nno\nstock options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nRestricted Stock\nSchlumberger grants performance share units to its executive officers.  The number of shares earned is determined at the end of each performance period based on Schlumberger’s achievement of certain predefined targets as defined in the underlying performance share unit agreement.  In the event Schlumberger exceeds the predefined target, shares for up to the maximum of\n250\n% of the target award may be awarded.  In the event Schlumberger falls below the predefined target, a reduced number of shares may be awarded.  If\n55\nSchlumberger falls below the threshold award performance level,\nno\nshares will be awarded.  As of December 31, 2020,\n3.8\nmillion performance share units were outstanding assuming the achievement of 100% of target.\nAll other restricted stock awards generally vest at the end of\nthree years\nor vest ratably in equal tranches over a three-year period.\nRestricted stock awards do not pay dividends or have voting rights prior to vesting.  Accordingly, the fair value of a restricted stock award is the quoted market price of Schlumberger’s stock on the date of grant less the present value of the expected dividends not received prior to vesting.\nThe following table summarizes information related to restricted stock transactions:\nDiscounted Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder the terms of the DSPP, employees can choose to have a portion of their earnings withheld, subject to certain restrictions, to purchase Schlumberger common stock.  The purchase price of the stock is\n92.5\n% of the lower of the stock price at the beginning or end of the plan period at six-month intervals.\nThe fair value of the employees’ purchase rights under the DSPP was estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions and resulting weighted-average fair value per share:\nTotal Stock-based Compensation Expense\nThe following summarizes stock-based compensation expense recognized in income:\nAt December 31, 2020, there was $\n335\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation arrangements, of which $\n198\nmillion is expected to be recognized in 2021, $\n102\nmillion in 2022, $\n26\nmillion in 2023, and $\n9\nmillion in 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately\n16\nmillion shares of Schlumberger common stock were available for future grants under Schlumberger’s stock-based compensation programs.\n56\n13.\nIncome Taxes\nSchlumberger operates in more than\n100\ntax jurisdictions, where statutory tax rates generally vary from\n0\n% to\n35\n%.\nIncome (loss) before taxes\nsubject to United States and non-United States income taxes was as follows:\nSchlumberger recorded net pretax charges of $\n12.515\nbillion in 2020 ($\n3.961\nbillion in the US and $\n8.554\nbillion outside the US); $\n12.901\nbillion in 2019 ($\n8.769\nbillion in the US and $\n4.132\nbillion outside the US); and $\n141\nmillion in 2018 ($\n102\nmillion in the US and $\n39\nmillion outside the US).  These charges and credits are included in the table above and are more fully described in Note 3 –\nCharges and Credits\n.\nThe components of net deferred tax assets (liabilities) were as follows:\nThe deferred tax balances at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were net of valuation allowances relating to net operating losses in certain countries of $\n127\nmillion and $\n82\nmillion, respectively.  Additionally, the deferred tax balances at December 31, 2020 were net of valuation allowances relating to foreign tax credits and capital losses of $\n106\nmillion and $\n54\nmillion, respectively.\nApproximately $353 million of the $\n421\nmillion deferred tax asset relating to net operating losses at December 31, 2020 can be carried forward indefinitely.  The vast majority of the remaining balance expires at various dates between 2030 and 2040.\nSchlumberger generally does not provide for taxes related to the undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries because such earnings either would not be taxable when remitted or they are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.\n57\nThe components of\nTax expense (benefit)\nwere as follows:\nA reconciliation of the United States statutory federal tax rate to the consolidated effective tax rate follows:\nA number of the jurisdictions in which Schlumberger operates have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving.  Schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities.  These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or, potentially, through the courts.  Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes that will be due upon the conclusion of these audits.  Due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:\nThe amounts above exclude accrued interest and penalties of $\n184\nmillion, $\n188\nmillion and $\n205\nmillion at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  Schlumberger classifies interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions within\nTax expense\n(benefit)\nin the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\n.\n58\nThe following table summarizes the tax years that are either currently under audit or remain open and subject to examination by the tax authorities in the most significant jurisdictions in which Schlumberger operates:\nIn certain of the jurisdictions noted above, Schlumberger operates through more than one legal entity, each of which may have different open years subject to examination.  The table above presents the open years subject to examination for the most material of the legal entities in each jurisdiction.  Additionally, it is important to note that tax years are technically not closed until the statute of limitations in each jurisdiction expires.  In the jurisdictions noted above, the statute of limitations can extend beyond the open years subject to examination.\n14.\nLeases and Lease Commitments\nSchlumberger’s leasing activities primarily consist of operating leases for administrative offices, manufacturing facilities, research centers, service centers, sales offices and certain equipment.  Total operating lease expense, which approximates cash paid and includes short-term leases, was $\n1.4\nbillion in 2020  and $\n1.7\nbillion in each of 2019 and 2018.\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nOperating lease assets of $\n0.8\nbillion and $\n1.3\nbillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were included in\nOther Assets\nin the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n.  Operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019 were $\n1.0\nbillion, of which $\n0.2\nbillion was classified in\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\nand $\n0.8\nbillion was classified in\nOther Liabilities\nin the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term as of December 31, 2020 was\n8\nyears.  The weighted-average discount rate used to determine the operating lease liability as of December 31, 2020 was\n3.2\n%.\n15.\nContingencies\nSchlumberger is party to various legal proceedings from time to time.  A liability is accrued when a loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated.  Management believes that the probability of a material loss with respect to any currently pending legal proceeding is remote.  However, litigation is inherently uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate disposition of any of these proceedings.\n59\n16.\nSegment Information\nDuring 2020, Schlumberger restructured its organization in order to prepare for a changing industry future.  This new structure is aligned with customer workflows and is directly linked to Schlumberger’s corporate strategy, a key element of which is customer collaboration.\nThe new organization consists of four Divisions that combine and integrate Schlumberger’s technologies, enhancing the portfolio of capabilities that support the emerging long-term growth opportunities in each of these market segments.\nThe four Divisions, representing Schlumberger’s segments, are:\nFinancial information for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, by segment, is as follows:\n60\nSegment assets consist of receivables, inventories, fixed assets, multiclient seismic data and APS investments.\nCapital investments includes capital expenditures, APS investments and multiclient seismic data cost capitalized.\n61\nDepreciation\nand amortization\nincludes\ndepreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets,\nmulticlient seismic data costs\nand\nAPS\ninvestments\n.\nRevenue\nby geographic area\nfor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:\nRevenue is based on the location where services are provided and products are sold.\nDuring each of the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, no single customer exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue.\nSchlumberger did not have revenue from third-party customers in its country of domicile during the last three years.  Revenue in the United States in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $\n4.5\nbillion, $\n9.3\nbillion and $\n10.1\nbillion, respectively.\nNorth America and International revenue disaggregated by segment was as follows:\n62\nFixed Assets less accumulated depreciation\nby geographic area are as follows:\n17.\nPension and Other Benefit Plans\nPension Plans\nSchlumberger sponsors several defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all US employees hired prior to October 1, 2004.  The benefits are based on years of service and compensation, on a career-average pay basis.\nIn addition to the US defined benefit pension plans, Schlumberger sponsors several other international defined benefit pension plans.  The most significant of these international plans are the International Staff Pension Plan and the UK pension plan (collectively, the “International plans”).  The International Staff Pension Plan covers certain international employees hired prior to July 1, 2014 and is based on years of service and compensation on a career-average pay basis.  The UK plan covers employees hired prior to April 1, 1999, and is based on years of service and compensation, on a final salary basis.\nThe weighted-average assumed discount rate, compensation increases and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to determine the net pension cost for the US and International plans were as follows:\n63\nNet pension cost (credit) for 2020, 2019 and 2018 included the following components:\nCertain of Schlumberger’s deferred benefit pension plans offered former Schlumberger employees, who had not yet commenced receiving their pension benefits, an opportunity to receive a lump sum payout of their vested pension benefit.  Schlumberger’s pension plans paid $\n257\nmillion from pension plan assets to those who accepted this offer, thereby reducing its pension benefit obligations.  These transactions resulted in a non-cash pension settlement charge of $\n37\nmillion, representing the immediate recognition of the related deferred actuarial losses in\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\n, in the fourth quarter of 2019.  See Note 3 –\nCharges and Credits\n.\nThe weighted-average assumed discount rate and compensation increases used to determine the projected benefit obligations for the US and International plans were as follows:\n64\nThe changes in the projected benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status of the plans were as follows:\n65\nThe unfunded liability represents the difference between the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”).  The PBO represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and compensation and includes an assumption about future compensation levels.  The accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and compensation but does not include an assumption about future compensation levels.\nActuarial losses arising during 2020 and 2019 were primarily attributable to decreases in the discount rate used to determine the PBO.  As of December 31, 2020, the PBO and fair value of plan assets for plans with PBOs in excess of plan assets were $\n9.4\nbillion and $\n8.3\nbillion, respectively.  The related ABO for these plans was $\n9.1\nbillion at December 31, 2020.\nThe weighted-average allocation of plan assets and the target allocations by asset category are as follows:\nAsset performance is monitored frequently with an overall expectation that plan assets will meet or exceed the weighted index of its target asset allocation and component benchmark over rolling\nfive-year\nperiods.\nThe expected rate of return on assets assumptions reflect the long-term average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested.  The assumptions have been determined based on expectations regarding future rates of return for the portfolio considering the asset allocation and related historical rates of return.  The appropriateness of the assumptions is reviewed annually.\nThe fair value of Schlumberger’s pension plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, by asset category, is presented below and was determined based on valuation techniques categorized as follows:\n66\n67\nSchlumberger’s funding policy is to annually contribute amounts that are based upon a number of factors including the actuarial accrued liability, amounts that are deductible for income tax purposes, legal funding requirements and available cash flow. Schlumberger expects to contribute approximately $\n20\nmillion to its postretirement benefit plans in 2021, subject to market and business conditions.\nPostretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions\nSchlumberger provides certain healthcare benefits to certain former US employees who have retired.\nEffective April 1, 2015, Schlumberger changed the way it provides healthcare coverage to certain retirees who are age 65 and over.  Under the amended plan, these retirees transferred to individual coverage under the Medicare Exchange.  Schlumberger subsidizes the cost of the program by providing these retirees with a Health Reimbursement Account.  The annual subsidy may be increased based on medical cost inflation, but it will not be increased by more than\n5\n% in any given year.\nThe actuarial assumptions used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for the US postretirement medical plan were as follows:\nThe net periodic benefit credit for the US postretirement medical plan included the following components:\nDue to the actions taken by Schlumberger to reduce its global workforce during 2020, Schlumberger experienced a significant reduction in the expected aggregate years of future service of its employees in its US postretirement medical plan. Accordingly, Schlumberger recorded a curtailment gain of $\n69\nmillion during the second quarter of 2020 relating to this plan. The curtailment gain includes recognition of the decrease in the benefit obligation as well as a portion of the previously unrecognized prior service credit, reflecting the reduction in expected years of future service.  As a result of the curtailment, Schlumberger performed a remeasurement of the plan, which had an immaterial impact.  This gain was classified in\nImpairments & other\nin the\nConsolidated Statement of Loss\n.  See Note 3 –\nCharges and Credits\n.\n68\nThe changes in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status were as follows:\nThe $\n122\nmillion asset relating to this plan at December 31, 2020 was included in\nOther Assets\nwhile the $\n8\nmillion unfunded liability at December 31, 2019 was included in\nPostretirement Benefits\nin the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n.\nThe assets of the US postretirement medical plan are invested\n61\n% in equity securities and\n39\n% in debt securities at December 31, 2020.  The fair value of these assets was primarily determined based on Level Two valuation techniques.\nOther Information\nThe expected benefits to be paid under the US and International pension plans as well as the postretirement medical plan are as follows:\n18.\nSupplementary Information\nCash paid for interest and income taxes was as follows:\n69\nInterest and other income\nincludes the following:\nThe change in\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nis as follows:\nRevenue in excess of billings related to contracts where revenue is recognized over time was $\n0.2\nbillion at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.  Such amounts are included within\nReceivables less allowance for doubtful accounts\nin the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n.\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\nconsist of the following:\n70\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nSchlumberger management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a–15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).  Schlumberger’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nSchlumberger management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020.  In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework.\nBased on this assessment Schlumberger’s management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, its internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nThe effectiveness of Schlumberger’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\n71\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nof Schlumberger Limited\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Schlumberger Limited and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n72\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nGoodwill & Intangible Asset Impairment\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded charges to goodwill associated with certain reporting units and certain intangible assets during the first quarter of 2020. As described by management, the goodwill relating to each of the Company’s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event, or change in circumstances, indicates an impairment may have occurred. Intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying values may not be recoverable. Management determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of certain of its reporting units and asset groups were less than their carrying value. Therefore, management performed interim impairment tests as of March 31, 2020. Management primarily used the income approach to estimate the fair value of its reporting units and asset groups, but also considered the market approach to validate the results. The market approach involves significant judgment in the selection of the appropriate peer group companies and valuation multiples. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in the income approach include the estimated future net annual cash flows and the discount rate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures related to goodwill and intangible asset impairment is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in determining the fair value of the reporting units and asset groups,  which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating significant assumptions related to cash flows to be derived from each reporting unit and asset group, the discount rate and valuation multiples.\nAddressing the matter involved performing subjective procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing fair value estimates; which included (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the income and market approaches; (ii) testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the approaches; and (iii) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management to develop the cash flows to be derived from each reporting unit and asset group.  Evaluating management’s assumptions related to the cash flows to be derived from each reporting unit and asset group involved evaluating the reasonableness of the assumptions used considering the Company’s past and anticipated performance, external market and industry data, and evidence obtained through other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the Company’s valuation approaches and reasonableness of the discount rate and valuation multiples assumptions.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s tax filings are subject to regular audit by tax authorities, and those audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities, or potentially through the courts. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes that will be due upon the conclusion of these audits.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures related to uncertain tax positions is a critical audit matter are the high degree of estimation uncertainty related to these liabilities due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations and management applied significant judgment in determining these liabilities, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s estimates.\n73\nAddressing the matter involved performing subjective procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the identification and recognition of uncertain tax positions. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating management’s process for developing the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions, (ii) testing the completeness and reasonableness of uncertain tax positions recorded in the consolidated financial statements, and (iii) evaluating material assessments received from the relevant tax authorities. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of assumptions used by management, including the\nreasonableness of management’s more-likely-than-not determination under relevant tax laws and regulations in applicable jurisdictions.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1952.\n74\nQuarterly Results\n(Unaudited)\nThe following table summarizes Schlumberger’s results by quarter for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019."

    "text": "In 2013, Schlumberger completed the wind-down of its service operations in Iran.  Prior to this, certain non-US subsidiaries provided oilfield services to the National Iranian Oil Company and certain of its affiliates (“NIOC”).\nSchlumberger’s residual transactions or dealings with the government of Iran in 2020 consisted of payments of taxes and other typical governmental charges.  Certain non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger maintained depository accounts at the Dubai branch of Bank Saderat Iran (“Saderat”), and at Bank Tejarat (“Tejarat”) in Tehran and in Kish for the deposit by NIOC of amounts owed to non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger for services rendered in Iran prior to the wind-down and for the maintenance of such amounts previously received.  One non-US subsidiary also maintained an account at Tejarat for payment of local expenses such as taxes.  Schlumberger anticipates that it will discontinue dealings with Saderat and Tejarat following the receipt of all amounts owed to Schlumberger for prior services rendered in Iran.\n76\nPART III"
